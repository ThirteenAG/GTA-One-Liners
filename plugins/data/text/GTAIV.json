I'm only compatible with alpha males of obscene wealth and I'm starting to worry that Niko might be a beta male of disgustingly-moderate means. And do you want to hear something really funny? Paige reckons she saw Niko driving a cab! Er, whatever babe! Considering she vomits on an hourly basis and hasn't been sober since the late 80s, I find it best to take all her observations with a large pinch of salt. And a large pinch of snow."

      "Police have confirmed reports that a body they recovered was identified as Aiden O'Mally - the convict and possible one-time terrorist who was sprung from a prison van recently in a violent attack. At the time, it was presumed that O'Malley had friends in criminally high places. Now it seems he was freed so he could be silenced, or punished for past crimes. Police have no leads on what might have been behind the need to silence or kill Mr. O'Malley, 48. O'Malley was born and raised in Dukes but spent much of his adult life in Ireland and Britain, where he was thought to have links with several paramilitary and terrorist groups. Some experts claim that, since the ending of the Troubles, several former activists have returned to Liberty City and are engaged in the settling of old scores, while also getting involved in new forms of crime including drug dealing."

It is also believed that Torres murdered Bohan community leader, Manny Escuela, and documentary film maker, Jay Hamilton.

Ravers and party goers emerged from the best decade of their lives only to be hit with the grim reality that they were going to pay the price for all that fun. Ten years later, people are starting to worry when all the devastating long-term effects are going to kick in. The answer is any minute. \"Every time I get a cold or forget my keys, I am convinced that it's the beginning of the end; that I'm going to be found rocking in darkened room in a state of permanent catatonia from all that LSD, Ecstasy and weed I did,\" said James, a 33-year-old lawyer from Algonquin, \"If it doesn't happen soon, I'm going to dust off the white gloves and glow sticks and get back out there.\""
