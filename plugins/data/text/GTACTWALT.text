D3059958     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...By stealing Yu Jian?
88DCDC08     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~They took it to upset Hsin...
60BFC92A     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...and disrupt his relationship with your uncle.
E22B1F3B     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~And, in order to upset them right back, I've planted some smack...
2D4D64BE     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...from a little personal stash I keep, in one of their cars.
BB9F9848     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Your personal stash of smack? You're a junkie?
6EB623B5     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~No. I'm not a junkie, I'm a hypocrite...
BA8721D2     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...which is much worse. I only use on weekends, usually.
96B8E7F5     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Hey, walk a mile in my shoes, buddy. I don't need your shit.
CF535B59     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~If we're gonna draw out these Korean assassins, make sure the LCPD busts that car.
15EABEF5     //  ~#FEF1~Parking contractors are towing away the Korean's car!
2F639ABB     //  ~#FF0C~Unknown~#FF00~~n~DO NOT REMOVE~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~How you doing? Listen...
31647127     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...if we are going to find out what the fuck is wrong with those Koreans...
5B517C29     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...we're going to need some proper information.
261CB1E4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...None of my contacts know shit about them. We need to put a bug inside a gang-house.
46FF2CD0     //  ~#FF0C~Unknown~#FF00~~n~DO NOT REMOVE
317EEC19     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Sounds easy enough.
581C1ABC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Maybe I should just walk up and ask one of them to let me in and plant it?
3FDBD8C9     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'm the one planting the bug, tough guy.
67127587     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I just need you to keep those low-lifes out of my hair for a while.
5A13D48D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You're insane! ...Why take such a big risk?
EAC25CB3     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Because IAD are gonna shut me down unless I deliver a big collar.
46FF2CD0     //  ~#FF0C~Unknown~#FF00~~n~DO NOT REMOVE
A2ADD3A2     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'm a good cop, but I've been doing bad shit ever since...
4A5A0ED3     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Never mind. Enough of my annoying anecdotes. Just create a diversion, Huang...
7E178397     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...and make sure it's a big one!
12E66F5C     //  ~#FF00~Destroy one of the Koreans' cars to get their attention.~#FF00~Your quarry is meeting an Underboss in his gang.
A8F9E028     //  ~#FF00~Another meeting with an Underboss is taking place.
2A35954D     //  ~#FF00~He's talking to another gang Underboss.
6287D209     //  ~#FF00~He's groveling to yet another gang Underboss.
71CB1DC1     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Well, you made it in the end. Don't worry about me.
445D3648     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'm just climbing the wall here. I've scratched myself raw all over.
6EFE4449     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~And I mean all over.
B86BBDD3     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Nice! It's real family fun hanging out with you, Heston. I'm glad I'm not a tax payer.
420606A4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Kid, keep up the patronizing tone. Really sympathetic of you. I'm a good cop, sometimes.
A947F4F9     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Anyway, the next time I want a morality lesson...
72CD3C82     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...from the son of a dead gangster, remind me to ask for one.
15539EF2     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Talking of tax dollars, the LCPD just put some to good use...
C580E8E4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...by releasing that Korean with a fucking caution.
AF1E926B     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Man, if they'd found even half that amount of drugs in my car, I'd lose my pension!
E8B7403A     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~In this country, only the President can boast about getting high.
48568E27     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~They'd let you off without even a slapped wrist... Are you shitting me?
3203695F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Cops always look after each other.
F6953AEC     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Not me. Internal Affairs are kicking my ass day and night.
F02A6D89     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~They don't seem to appreciate that to get results you've got to bend the rules a little.
46B343A4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Just like in the movies...
12A98357     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Tough cop goes it alone... that's me.
02751BD0     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Absolutely. Exactly how I would describe you. What are we going to do about that Korean prick?
5D87096B     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Well, he's gonna have to 'explain' himself to all his Underbosses for getting arrested.
697342B1     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Why don't you follow him and introduce yourself to all of them?
BA6699EF     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~If that doesn't get their attention, I don't know what will.
9A824B06     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You're using me as bait?
34578C31     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You wanna catch the big fish, you gotta put a worm on the line.
E4379081     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...No offense, Huang. I just always wanted to use that line.
261748D4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Now, talking of lines, give me that coke and get out of here.
085A7E39     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Where's my coke?
9ED54356     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I don't know: In your coke dealer's bag, maybe?
2CB3EB26     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You didn't get it?
432C432B     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Listen kid, in this partnership I'm the senior guy. If I say I want something you better bring it.
623EA21A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Fuck you. I'm not your runner.
E5FA226F     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Let me remind you - we're supposed to be helping each other out here.
B53F6618     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~For fuck's sake! Quit your whining. I'll get your coke.
A0E09B74     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hold onto what's left of your nose, I might be a while.~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Heston?
0D02EA74     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...HESTON?
6CD7AF1D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Where's Yu Jian? Where's my father's sword? Come on. Speak. I need that fucking sword.
C6F8D821     //  ~#FF09~Assassin~#FF00~~n~...Our Boss has it.
636B897E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Who is your Boss?
94792CBF     //  ~#FF09~Assassin~#FF00~~n~Interesting question. And if I wasn't dying, maybe you could torture me and find out.
EB27C2DF     //  ~#FF09~Assassin~#FF00~~n~But, as I am dying, I can happily tell you to go fuck yourself.
1DA5F5D9     //  ~#FF09~Assassin~#FF00~~n~You'll find out soon enough.
40BFCC5A     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~Nice one, Huang! You killed our only lead!
539B8F16     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~My father had to be avenged!
7260A1D6     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~Yes, and what better way to avenge him than to kill a low level gang banger...
33912125     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~...letting the boss go free? Without a lead we'll never find their boss!
14214923     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~All you care about is making your bust...
512C400B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...so you can save your ass from IAD.
08B2B392     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~This city is full of busts.
9F4137C8     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~I want THIS Bust! ... You screwed up, Huang.
2B0E20E5     //  ~#FF0C~Assassin~#FF00~~n~Keep back! I'm warning you! I'll kill him if you don't let me go!
F3757F54     //  ~#FF0C~Assassin~#FF00~~n~I'm happy to kill him, man! Very happy!
47F38CFD     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Huang! Over here!
039E6E97     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Well, you picked a fine time to O.D., dumbass.
AEDACB00     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Oh, you're killing me with the humor.
CF477A40     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Why don't you try one of your lame gags on this guy, and get me the fuck out of here?
A6D3B24B     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Take the bastard from a distance, Huang!~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~My eagerly talking friend at the FIB has an illegal wiretap...
75170935     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...that's been compromised.
66744FB7     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~If we fix it for him, he'll give us the name of their rat.
B7E257F7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Fuck that, friend! You're wasting my time.
CA010996     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hsin already thinks I'M the Fed rat. And you want me to work for them?
F6A4DF51     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...How's it gonna look if your uncle finds out you've been working with me - a 'cop'?
31530B4C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It would look bad until I killed you, you piece of shit.
54275DBB     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You're not the only one under pressure, Huang.
355D6249     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'm going cold turkey while IAD are all over me, but I'm still doing the right thing.
96D16B8F     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You do the right thing: Destroy the scrambler that's screwing with the Fed's wiretap
4BC467F1     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...then your life, and mine, can start getting back to normal.
2676EB59     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You must think I'm a moron.~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, what's this legally 'sensitive' job, Heston?
2571382F     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~We need to sink Zhou Ming's contraband boat for him.
E9B8BF53     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Are you insane? Or back to skag?
3FBCF8CB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~If I'm caught attacking Triad shipments, my life is over!
CA1989D0     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Well, tough shit, tough guy. My life fell apart years ago thanks to that Wonsu rat bastard!
18C88091     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~By the way, who the fuck is the Wonsu?
41C27A6A     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~That's what that inner circle of Koreans call themselves.
962D13DC     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~That's my business. Yours is sinking that boat.
2E3596BC     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~And, if you want to keep playing happy families with your Triad friends,
116BB810     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I guess you'd better make sure no one aboard lives to tell tales on you.
4AF4E4AB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Thank you. Why the fuck do you expect me to know all the terminology? Racist idiot.
42B1D4AC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And this isn't just about landing a big bust to get IAD off your back, is it?~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~IAD took my car - that's a big problem for me - there were certain things I should have got rid of in that car.
B953C600     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Things that will take other people down. You've gotta get it back before my fucking squad catches up with it.
1D7479A2     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, just to get this straight,
726F45AF     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Some of the evidence will implicate them.
BAAE3AAA     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~When they catch up with my car they are gonna blow it to kingdom come.
C9AD212F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Okay, and that's a bad thing why?
BE019372     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Well, the car belonged to my wife, god rest her...
A787D517     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I love that car! I don't want a scratch on it!
718292C8     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm not your valet, FRIEND, I'm not doing this again.
77DC0259     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You don't know what this means to me, Huang ... this car was the last thing my wife bought me before she...
D18A5B3D     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...you know, before she was...
E1FE193E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Before she what, buddy?
DAFBB89A     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Before she fucked my best friend! There, I said it.
F2CEE422     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...you don't want your squad snatching your car back from IAD?
327778CC     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Exactly. I'm so fucked, I don't want help from my best friends.
C47C41CB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Last time we spoke, you were divorced, now you're a widower. Heston - I think you just might be full of shit.
9E8B22DF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'll get you your car, and then you and I will have words.
23012F68     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'm a loser, and that's why I'm a drug addict, now, give me that fucking car. I'll be in touch.
6765E5BF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You're back on the drugs, aren't you?
52B8B6BF     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~No way! I'm clean and serene. And you know what? I forgive you. Step 8! Step fucking 8, buddy.~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, you've got a real lead, or do you just want me to do your dirty work?
ABB58BB1     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~In time, Huang. First, if I'm gonna stay ahead of IAD, I'm gonna need to get off the coke, the heroin...
D9B09B06     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...and all the other shit - only, my dealer won't let one of his best customers go so easy.
B9B09BE4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~He's got 'evidence' against me going way back...
43BD007F     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...and he's threatening he'll hand it all to IAD today unless I keep buying.
1FA21BFE     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~They're already breathing hard down my neck - this would bury me.
DDDB2D52     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Why don't your buddies help you out?
D51A2281     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~All they care about is their cut. Look, you owe me, Huang!
7C51FEF1     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~IAD would be off my back already if it hadn't been for you.
9F08BE66     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'll find your dealer and make sure his evidence meets a fitting end.
BE19BF3F     //  ~#FF00~IAD are here!
21F1712A     //  ~#FF00~There goes Heston's dealer now. Looks like he's in a hurry.
C3EBC931     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm not sure how you figure that out, my friend. I know - it's tough being a cop.
293B4C59     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You have to give out parking tickets and you get to shoot people. Boo hoo.
35245093     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~But you clean up your act. You're revolting.~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Before my contact was fingered by Internal Affairs...
986B2B92     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...he told me our rat's ID is on an encrypted file in the FIB mainframe.
B9DD93F3     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You're gonna have to hack in, steal that file, and then cover your tracks before sending it to me.
D71F1A18     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What a fucking clich!
548FF570     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~A break? Try this.
444949DA     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Then I sell the movie rights and we all get famous, but we don't sell out...
21FC5FB4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~When the dust settles maybe we can think about revenge.
22D614BB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Computer hacking and encrypted files?
007313F1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Give me a break.
D371A1CC     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Then I bust a major underworld player...
D9A6119E     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...look like a hero, and IAD goes away.
8300330B     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...we remain true to ourselves and we make something of ourselves.
01ED5282     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Something special that was always there.
C4955AB5     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You look like someone shat in your bed... what's wrong?
2F086FAF     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~The Feds have been speaking to two guys: Chan and Zhou.
6B9EC425     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~They've been selling each other, and Hsin, to the FIB separately.
CAF1A031     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Both of them are rats?
747691EA     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~It doesn't add up:
1AD21FE6     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...but which one ... I don't know.
DE80DC9B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, what do we do? Whack both the shits?
A5A67C74     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You take the file to your uncle - it's what he needs to get back in with Hsin.
95F35CE4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Me - I'm giving up and getting out before IAD finally nail me.
C094DE9E     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I ain't going to get that bust. I guess I should start negotiating with internal affairs.
60F48659     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...Good luck, buddy.
795F4672     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~One of them has to be the Wonsu Boss...
289FD539     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And one of them may have ordered the hit...
57ED414F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...on my father and stole that fucking sword?
4083661C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Arrogant shit then moron shit?
0893F152     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Not me. I'm done. This is too much of a mess.
2D25D9A9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I guess the biopic will have to wait for your ego to return?~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~This is the plant's control room. I should be able to get the gates open from in there.
428283E7     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~IAD are right on my ass. We don't have much time.
54B7BF81     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I thought you'd given up on this game and were retiring?
B58BD3D1     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~So did I ... but, I told you already, I've got my reason.
73BBB4C3     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...You never told me what it was.
DE1CAF72     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...My wife ... Before I screwed up my career, this guy's assassins trailed my car and tried to kill me.
C43BC38B     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Only, it wasn't me in the car...
9BC1DF1A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Your wife! Give me a break.
AAE4DF1E     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Okay, it's bullshit, but it sounded good. I'll put that in the movie script.
F79FA76E     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...C'mon. My lying FIB contact is meeting up...
C5357411     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...with the real Wonsu boss at the desalinization plant. Let's get over there.
9A05B362     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~There they are! The Assassin's boss and my FIB contact!
D151E95D     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~We've got them at last! C'mon!
CD3E9993     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...He looks ... familiar.
AEFCA983     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~FREEZE!
6FA3AF43     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Uncle!
988467C5     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Huang... I... I can explain. I know it looks bad, but...
48C0A064     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Don't even try to lie your way out of this, asshole!
1005C413     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You killed my father. I knew you were a creep, but your own brother!
2C800A26     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It was a necessary and honorable sacrifice. I cried for many moons over that one.
A00D3C8E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Stop with the phony kung fu dialogue, you low life piece of shit. Just so you could be leader?
531F4A03     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I've protected you throughout all of this. You should be thanking me.
747C90A6     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I understand, these events are complicated for the mind of one so young, but I forgive you.
096C2C97     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You're under arrest you son-of-a-bitch!
A3E59D7E     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I think not ... GUARDS!
D7760D4D     //  ~#FF03~IAD~#FF00~~n~I.A.D. Nobody move!
C4EEEB8F     //  ~#FF03~IAD~#FF00~~n~Put your weapons down!
CB0A1F8D     //  ~#FF03~IAD~#FF00~~n~Officer Heston, we're taking you in!
095F9717     //  ~#FF03~FIB~#FF00~~n~FIB!
B68E15C2     //  ~#FF03~FIB~#FF00~~n~Hands in the air!
C759D7CB     //  ~#FF03~FIB~#FF00~~n~ALL of you assholes are under arrest!
41CAB3D8     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Your uncle's gonna get away!
19A84A19     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~This place is like a maze. Which way did he go?
54BE73C1     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~You go that way - I'll check up here.
7CDAD1F4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~We can't give up now!
B842AD24     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~We need to get the exit gate open - I'll check out those controls up ahead.
18F19536     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...Got it! The gate's open! Not bad for an ex-freebasing, alcoholic, bent cop.
D85B3110     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Your loving uncle's getting away! ...I'll take the wheel - you nail any scum that gets in our way!
1D32A606     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~HSIN!
737E6E10     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~This is your fault!
3FD7E728     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Huang ... Huang is going to kill me. But, I'll make sure you die first, you old lizard!
049821FB     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Kill him Huang! He... he murdered your father!
1230676E     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It was YOUR test of loyalty! You ordered me to take the sword, knowing my brother would have to die for me to claim it!
10C570E6     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~If I'd refused, it would have been over for me.
0C2D2C6B     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Had you just brought me the sword you would have become the next Triad boss.
529C8D2B     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~From behind the figurehead of your idiot son! Have him take credit for my leadership? ...NEVER!
D836E3A8     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...You! ...You had the sword stolen from Huang so you wouldn't have to accept the fate I allotted you!
4DE09421     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...Then you bleated to the Feds and had Chan and Zhou blamed so no one stood in your path to succeed me!
B484F389     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~....You deceitful criminal! And your dialogue is weak and uninspiring.
E6AF152A     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Still want my brother's sword, Hsin? Here - TAKE IT!
0F9A741B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Where's the noble honor now, Uncle?
66A921CE     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I'm sorry Huang, you were never supposed to find out - please understand, I had no choice...
F80F34FC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Choice? I swore on Father's grave I would kill the man responsible for his death ...do I have a choice now?
133AADCE     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...No ...You should honor your father's memory. And by the way, your father was a real jerk as a brother. I'm glad I killed him.
A07197C1     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...I'm so sorry Huang.
434F7761     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~He's mad! He means to kill us all! ...Save ME, Huang!
12667FD2     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Let us grieve together for those we have lost Huang...
757812D3     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~The Triads need a leader. It could be you... if you are truly loyal...
CDF28B68     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...perhaps a little test?
1FC152E9     //  ~#FF03~Cop~#FF00~~n~POLICE! FREEZE!
24910862     //  ~#FF03~Cop~#FF00~~n~YOU'RE ALL UNDER ARREST!

F639323C     //  ~#FF03~FIB~#FF00~~n~FIB! NOBODY MOVE!
5E1AAA93     //  ~#FF03~FIB~#FF00~~n~FREEZE!
2670F7CE     //  ~#FF03~Cop~#FF00~~n~Throw your weapons down!
B7495720     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'm Detective Wade Heston! LCPD undercover! This is my bust!
E2F1B57D     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Hsin Jaoming, you're under arrest for ...
3B9BD1D4     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~...well, I guess I'll think of something really heavy on the way to the station.
0D8796F9     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Take him away.
1AC1C6F4     //  ~#FF03~Cop~#FF00~~n~Yes Sir!
D6151D53     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Hell, you might as well take in everyone in this place... ...except Huang. He's a good kid, for a rich snot.
6A9C3A0D     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~I can't retire without landing one good bust. So we can't kill this motherfucker.
1852BEFD     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Come on. Either that, or I'm looking at retirement in a cell. And trust me, everyone LOVES a bent cop in prison.
2D0F08E5     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I'm a good man, put in a difficult situation by a cruel fate.
56EEA8F0     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~And by the way, your father was a real jerk as a brother. I'm glad I killed him.
598DFCFF     //  ~#FF09~Heston~#FF00~~n~Shut the fuck up and relax. Everybody.
284138B7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Shut up, you pompous porn loving jerk.~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Ah, Huang Lee. Champagne? Cocaine? Attractive trans-sexual prostitute?
AD9072C2     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~We can toast my becoming the next Triad boss.
D3C69CD1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~No thanks ... So, has your father actually made you the new boss?
709050F3     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Not yet, but my father's approval is guaranteed.
7BE33B15     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~After years of putting me down and calling me a moron...
BA3D2F62     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...he's finally realized I'm the best man for the job.
D7DAE6B4     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I only need the support of the Tongs to smooth my passage.
4A66FF02     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...I'm sure you do.
8FC5AA2B     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Currently they favor Zhou Ming...
4DE2B3F2     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...but he's more of a street thug than a true leader.
F170C17C     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Yes, he's intelligent and charming, but I've got leadership in my genes.
E885575B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm sure you've got a lot of things in your genes.
A6B325F8     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Definitely!
3A55E118     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I can show the Tongs I'm twice the man Zhou is by winning the city's biggest street race.
F15C60C2     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Oh, that'll win them over. Nothing says leadership like joy riding.
64413257     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I know! It's a fantastic plan.
52CD08F8     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~The problem is - the current street race champion is a rotten cheat.
30EA9452     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~If I'm going to win fairly we need to make a few subtle modifications to his car.
58839985     //  ~#FF00~There's the street race champion.~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...Oh, my head!
6378C9B7     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I've got a killer hangover. One of those that feels like a midget is in your head...
575B4193     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...and he's trying to get it on with your cortex, and that street race is just about to start!
60908507     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I'm fucked! My therapist would call this self-sabotage, but then...
565B5C64     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...my therapist has never had a transsexual prostitute.
1D4CD9CF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~The race you want to win to impress the Tongs?
F5037D67     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Yeah, but I heard the other drivers have cars that are race lightened for extra speed.
F19CCF06     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~How can even I - the best driver in the city - compete with them when they cheat like that?
0D3833F1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You mean they're driving race cars in a car race? ...That's disgraceful.
84AB64D2     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I know and I've got to win this race, Huang.
ED892E41     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I can't have both my dad and my therapist laughing at me again.
E97C6D51     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~There's nothing for it. You'll just have to smash them all off the track to make sure I win.
CA08E182     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...It's only proper.
FF612788     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I told you I'd win Huang! And in the end I didn't even need your help.
89628E87     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~The Tongs are gonna be pretty impressed when they hear about this.
749A7A69     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I might blog about this and stick it on my myroomonline page.
3AF10437     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You gangster!
A6FCFE89     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Let's hope the Tongs just hear about it ...
17861C0C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~and weren't watching.
8BB49D3B     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Huang, baby ...
79D7F6A2     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~when I am the boss you'll have a place at my side.
F543E67A     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~You could be my number one number two! Heh-heh!
F9DC31CF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You and me, Chan, we're heading to the top!~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~Master Chan has been kidnapped!
8A03BBE2     //  ~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~They're headed for the docks in BOABO. Come on!
685F2105     //  ~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~We've got to save him, or I'll get killed.
DEEC7803     //  ~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~We've got the kidnappers pinned down. But, master Chan is trapped in the car.
A44E65A6     //  ~#FF03~Irish Killer~#FF00~~n~Cook, you motherfucker! Burn!
54B6997A     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~What will the Tongs think of me now? Kidnapped in my own car!
EDDA3850     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...Again!
6716E2E7     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~This is all your fault, Huang!
B76B9F56     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~My fault? Give me a break, you moron.
FE986672     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~That gang took me because you knocked their driver out of that stupid street race!
1D91CDC3     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~But, you told me to...or is your brain so small you can't remember back that far?
23C7D814     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Oh, you egomaniac with your long memory! Get some help.
B966FC02     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Get some therapy. You narcissist. I could have been killed!
E16A6463     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~... Oh God. I need to change my pants.
CC4E6F15     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Somebody take me back to my penthouse!~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~The Tongs are going to be so impressed.
CC4B170D     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I've managed set up a deal with a rough crew who have been a Triad enemy for years.
0EC40603     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Those people want peace Huang - and I'm the one who's going to broker it.
92865B26     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Maybe they just want a piece of you?
85872E34     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Huang, you want to take the old chill pill, my man...
13D7CC31     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...have a drink, get mellow, partner.
9F0F29DA     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~A great leader knows when...
36B7325F     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...to take advantage of opportunity...
790816C6     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...when to forgive and when to forget.
FF3022D7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And a moron doesn't know when to say no.
6BDB23D4     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Absolutely. What was I saying?
39C8A1D3     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~This isn't what we arranged: What the fuck's going on?
C508E9E8     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Don't these people know who I am?
2BE52DB5     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~We're getting jumped, genius...Stay with me!
4509C3C5     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~What about the gear?
8CF86862     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~... Ah, a wise leader knows when to write off a loss! Let's get out of here!
57B98950     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Those assholes set me up! I just can't believe it!
E0BEE87C     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~If the Tongs find out about this, I'm going to be a laughing stock.
AB2C5E86     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~It's the cops!
63A23415     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Lose them Huang!
C78E5E0E     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~Freeze!
1EF565D2     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~Huang Lee. Mr. 'Junior Triad of the year'. We've been watching you, little man.
F7126355     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~You've certainly been enjoying yourself in our fair city.
A19A779E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Let's be honest, it's not as much fun as it used to be.
22D62423     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Now, book me or shoot me, don't bore me.
7DE58DE7     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~Oh, I'd happily shoot you, you little prick.
A773098E     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~But, my guess is, until you've found your uncle's sword, and your father's killer,
3A38454D     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~...you don't wanna get shot.
67732014     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~...That's right, Huang, I know all about the ambush - and I'm REAL interested in the guys that did it.
500BD6CD     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~I've been on their tails for a long time.
8A3DD16C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Sorry ... can't help you. Don't speak much English.
746CD65C     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~Let's not waste each other's time. We both know you're gonna work for me.
5CCDB594     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Work for a cop?
68FFC760     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~Cop! Don't patronize me. I'm an...
5D135A5F     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~...Undercover Detective. Wade Heston's the name.
25B081EB     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~You and I ain't all that different, Huang. We're both businessmen, looking to turn a profit.
396E0244     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~You do it your way, I do it mine. Do as you're told and we'll both profit from this.
FC549041     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'm part of the criminal process.
61B2A3A7     //  ~#FF06~Heston~#FF00~~n~I'll be in touch.~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Huang Lee ... hmmm, so you're the one who lost my sword.
CB1E52D9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~My father's sword ...and it was stolen...
CF1D383B     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I knew your father. One doesn't like to speak ill of the dead...
0C2D4C84     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...but in his case I might make an exception.
E6FB5FA0     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I've been unimpressed by you so far...
A14A21E8     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...and now my son tells me...
29D3080F     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...he had to save you himself in a recent ambush.
5AFF22D9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Oh, yeah. That's exactly what happened...
7E93099B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...thanks Chan. He's a brave and wise boy.
7C0E1B8C     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~My son is a cretin, but also not your bodyguard.
CDEE0244     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~You will show me proper respect by redeeming your shame!
21E8EA49     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Now, get a fuel tanker and ram the ambushers' gambling den. I want them to BURN!
444FECF7     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...Do not fail us again.
CB4BC905     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Err... No. I don't owe you anything, old man. I've come here, been mugged, robbed...
A95FBA91     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...and put up with morons telling me what to do. Go fuck yourself.
48990396     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Your language is a little agricultural, but I like your spirit, boy. How about if I say please?
577400D7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Then as long as you lay off all the bullshit about honor, I'll do anything you ask.~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Huang, we're gonna be famous! Or, more correctly, infamous...
110B4167     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...which I guess I already am, but at least you get to play catch-up.
DE08FCFF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What are you talking about?
A330F8A6     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I'm talking about - Lights! Camera! Action! Ha! Ha! Ha!
EA9B058B     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~This reporter girlfriend of mine is making a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary all about the drug trade, but from our perspective.
EBA7CD76     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Crazy isn't it?
78C58A22     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~If you've agreed to take part in it, then yes you are.
8E77E3F2     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Typically you're not seeing the bigger picture, Huang.
479E117C     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~When the Tongs hear I'm the TV show's Mr. Big, they're gonna be in awe of me.
3C50A4B2     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Yeah, you could send them signed photos from your prison cell.
F970E6C9     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Show a little faith, Huang. Our names won't be mentioned, and our faces will be blurred out.
607ADEF2     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~The Tongs will still figure it out of course. I mean, they won't know, but they will know... You know?
C1A4906D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~No... No, not really.
1561EB27     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Well, I do. And that's why I'm the boss.
050D248B     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Get over to the holding compound in Hove Beach and retrieve her TV van. She's had a little trouble with a parking violation.
C4C1D2A3     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Once you've got the van, take it over to her in BOABO.
3A9DCEEA     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Hey! You got my van back! Cool! ...You must be Chan's guy, Huang. I'm Mel.
C1AC3B94     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Chan's guy? ...Whatever. How come your studio didn't get your van back for you?
621FB374     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Studio? I'm independent! I report what I like, when I like, how I like. The shit I make is art. It's my heart and soul.
46E63AFF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So you're broke?
5D781F02     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Only until I sell out to a major TV network. Hey! You could be the star of my show!
EF8B5D7E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hey! No thanks.
D4611B83     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Don't worry. I'll arrange everything. See you soon!~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~That bitch has betrayed me!
7D7AFB4B     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~How could she treat me like this? I thought we meant something to each other.
734D4D72     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What did Mel the media whore do now?
7F60B4F6     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Channel 15 has given Mel's show a slot in its schedule. But, that bitch isn't going to edit out our names and faces!
6AE6A4BD     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I mean, who could have seen that coming?
EFB2EAD9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Apart from a retarded amoeba?
DEAC91F9     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Oh, don't start, Mr. fucking know-it-all! Do us all a favor and put your massive head to work figuring a way out of this!
1B14E77C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's easy, moron. We get over to Channel 15, grab her tapes, and kill her.
2433B74B     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~She may have betrayed me, but... ...all that thinly veiled flirting...
FD817636     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...the hinted promise of tender romance ...the hours spent together online M.M.O.G-ing!
E98AF099     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~It can't be for nothing. No.
0A870F19     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Here's 'my' plan: get over to Channel 15, grab her tapes...
F8E2F7E0     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...and bring her back to me.
D0947612     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~If I go to all the trouble of carrying this bitch to Chan's and he just shoots her, I'm gonna be so pissed.
185CD660     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Why, Melanie? Why were you selling me out? I gave you access to my whole operation.
EC126C8C     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~We had an agreement. I thought you were ...different. I thought we had something.
80A8DC8B     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~We do. That's why you need to understand: this is all Huang's fault.
0C930BD3     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What? No it's not!
50F18999     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~He made me feel bad about myself, so I ...I had to show him.
169F561A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Had to show me what? That you're a sell-out bitch?
F6350318     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You were planning this from the beginning. Chan, you're a fool for ever listening to her.
F9B13800     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~A fool? ...Yes. A mad, crazy, roguishly handsome, underworld God of a fool, but it was all for love.
32926654     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Oh, please!
CC110678     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~But... love betrayed me. I don't want to kill you, Melanie, but what choice do I have?
EBFE862C     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~You want to be the boss? Then be the boss. You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
E5093446     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~You've got the tapes. I can't hurt you without them. You could just let me go.
6654EB93     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Let you go?
26137C6B     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I know you want to.
C3E51C1C     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...Yes ...but, they'd say I was going soft.
E09C5855     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~You're the boss, not 'them'.
3B95DE48     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's not as simple as that.
D1BE0F03     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Shut up! I'm the boss! Me! I do what I like, when I like, how I like!
6B29D112     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~We have the tapes... You're harmless now...
BD29D699     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Everyone will understand...
B50B9F86     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...Go ...Just go.
F3603065     //  ~#FF00~The TV Studio's front entrance is locked, and security around the side looks tight. Maybe there's an easier way in?~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Man, Huang, I'm on top of the world. I just banged an incredible set of twins. One girl, one boy.
71B1B850     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~And I've scored some incredible ketamine, and also, business is going great.
A324FB4C     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I'm really focused on it. I'm a fucking natural. I've more territory, businesses and power than ever.
48AD683C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Yeah, some of that territory was my uncle's.
6EB0A1FC     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Hey, Huang, seriously - No hard feelings. It was all going to belong to me soon enough anyway
25371AEA     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~and you and me - we're like brothers, only better, because if I meet your mother, I can sleep with her ...
DDFFDF41     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~but if we were real brothers, I couldn't, because she wouldn't let me.
53A0E5E4     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~How about I make it up to you?
21A9EA58     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Make what up? Ruining my uncle's power base, or sleeping with my mother.
7681EE55     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I never slept with your mother. I haven't met her. Oh, you're joking. Great! Listen ...
30D1631A     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I took this amazing speedboat from those idiot Spanish Lords. If you can catch me, it's yours.
3554DAB5     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Come on, let's party like we're on TV!
934B32FB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~This guy is ridiculous.
E9009AE0     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Those pesky Spanish Lords must have sabotaged this thing before I took it.
D0DA44E0     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Who the fuck says 'pesky'? Come on, swim over to me.
7F6C0E96     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...I can't swim!
AAF42358     //  ~#FF03~Radio~#FF00~~n~zzsch ...We're coming for you Chan. Just wait right there, homeboy... zzsch
4C971F22     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Oh fuck! Those bastards are after me!
7CF90881     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Take care of those morons, Huang! ...I'll radio for back up and look moody over here.~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Oh, it's you. Let's be blunt for a minute, the situation is intolerable!
8AEA4586     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~The Feds are clamping down on all my businesses. Land of opportunity my ass!
197DA2A7     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I'd been better off bribing officials in Szechuan than putting up with this bullshit.
18A80FAD     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~And worse, they are constantly one step ahead of us... We must have a guy with a big mouth in our midst.
D6B1F9F0     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I have sworn before the heads of all the Tongs: We will find this traitor and he will be shown no mercy!
35CB3C04     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I heard Chan was arrested too.
4801C2FD     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Fuck Chan! He could do with a bit of discipline anyway. His mother failed him terribly.
7049D039     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I've got a far bigger issue than that ...
2317E0FE     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~some men of mine have been cornered while carrying a large quantity of very dirty money ...
7EC846F2     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~which we were about to export, so it could get laundered.
AFDF0542     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...Make sure that money gets out of the country.
5E8AD56E     //  The cops are holding Hsin's men in the NOOSE van.~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Huang, this is outrageous!
C1C53C17     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~On the one hand, I'm free, and on the other,
399EAD1D     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...I'm having business I stole in good faith taken away from me.
B0473F32     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~The Feds are raiding all of my counterfeiting operations!
FD3D3397     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What do you want to do? Blackmail one of them?
28628648     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Threaten to kill someone's family?
D971EB71     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~No, screw them! I'm going to party anyway!
F745ECEB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Chan, if the Feds link you to any of that fake merchandise...
D00F40EA     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...you're finished.
F0EAB66E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~They'll use it to put you away for 100 years.
0509F8E3     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~They're not going to find any fake crap, Huang, because you're going to destroy it all for me.
85D08054     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Yes, because I was bored and really wanted a favor to do for you.
EB6A3E79     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Man, I love having you in my life. I'm going to blog about you when I wake up tomorrow.~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~In searching for the Feds' rat...
F74A0697     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I have uncovered, amongst my so called people, many snakes, pigs, and dogs!
117DD66D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's like a petting zoo of disrespect.
9A500365     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Something like that.
FB57492A     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Our long time allies who have reneged on their traditional oaths must be disciplined accordingly...
9A5C43B1     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...like all those who displease me.
6A2E06A2     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Behead them, Huang.
444E826E     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Make sure I am not displeased with you...
0A26BDC1     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Otherwise, I'll chop your head off and all, you little snot.
85D3A913     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hsin - I did what you asked - the traitors are dead.
2A4C5406     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Yet still, the Feds' rat scurries amongst us, Huang...
77E65AD7     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Interesting isn't it. This harassment started soon after you began working for us.
EB1EF4C4     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Coincidence is a bitch.
63CC887A     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Admit your guilt, Huang!
814B7280     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What? No ... that's crazy!
3365A261     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I just went medieval on some motherfuckers for you. Give me a break.
C8B9605A     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~A liar to the end! And this is the end for you!
024B7B61     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Man - that's too cheesy - can't you give me another death line?
21DC25D1     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Wait! Hsin, My nephew is innocent.
5DF67F21     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Innocent? He's been ratting us out since he arrived.
2E75247B     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I bet he even organized Yu Jian's theft! That sword was to have been mine!
0003D130     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~He didn't steal the sword, Hsin.
77ECD782     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'll buy you a new fucking sword, old man.
6AD6134B     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I wanted that one. He must be executed for his crimes.
977764FD     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Wait! ...Huang will find the sword AND the real rat! Just give him time.
DE1CB29D     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Who are you to tell me what to do, Kenny? You've even got a stupid name.
46C32D88     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Guards!
C858756C     //  ~#FF06~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Please, Hsin! ...Huang is all I have left of my brother...
91F26D32     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~... ... ... Very well.
960EE541     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~But, failure to discover the Fed rat AND Yu Jian, before my patience runs out,
A089895F     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~will be a big fucking mistake, buddy.~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~They let Chan out on bail.
009A4392     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Great. How is he?
5BC8C082     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Hidden. Hidden away where he can cause me no more trouble.
7E552FA4     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...Now, tell me - are you loyal, Huang?
D2124436     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm a Triad. You can trust me.
54DBFBB4     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Your uncle is bitter and power crazed and your father was a buffoon.
ADB6018A     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~It was one of Chan's trusted entourage that sold him out.
1ADB4E3E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~How do you know?
07630B62     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I have some cops on my payroll.
F3766788     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~They tell me he's the Fed's star witness against Chan.
AD76F420     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~The only thing I want him witnessing is a bullet entering his brain.
45D76C72     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'll get right on it.
ACB3B5DA     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Don't get caught, Huang...
EA3D03E3     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...I can't have this coming back to me. Take him out from a distance.
89EF16BA     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~For a second I thought you were concerned for my welfare.
E3851EDC     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Mess this up and you'll be the one worrying about your welfare.
69D1D45A     //  ~#FF00~Scan the area. The target is dressed in a white shirt and jeans. He usually leaves the gardens at around 15:30.~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I'm sick of waiting for my stupid father to step down. I should be boss NOW!
56D3031C     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I can do anything he can - bigger and better!
A3F56737     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Definitely. You're the man, homie.
A73E741F     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Did you know he had one of my entourage...
4EDD4F7E     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...dealt with?
31C565B4     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~My posse! My crew! I mean...
7517E4F6     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Chan, that fool was bleating about you to the Feds.
B219876A     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I know! One's not enough! They're all rats!
0B357FD8     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Everyone I know is worthless!
366D4DA4     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~They only like me because I'm good looking, rich, successful and charismatic.
762E695A     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Come on! We'll show them what happens to rats.
B8F86EA4     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I told my so called 'friends' to meet me just south of here.
D438A456     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~There are a lot of bottles back here...how much have you drunk, genius?
F16C2ACA     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Not much! ...Hic!
3787AB4D     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...Anyway I refilled them with gas.
7AF79A85     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I wanna make sure my 'friends' welcome for me is a warm one.
CA7D45F6     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~We're here. Let's get their attention.
5A2A8DFB     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Torch those parasites, Huang!
39161775     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~It's hard to find people like you, Huang ... People I can trust.
A5A37055     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Good people you can share a secret with...
4C7E909F     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...and then have a threesome with and it not be weird afterwards.
D62A8222     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It wouldn't be weird afterwards, Chan. You'd just be dead.
CE90D5D8     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Whatever. More for me! See you around.
E8782828     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I'm going to write a poem and work up a sweat and stand in the rain...
7C8BEE26     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...laughing and crying at the same time.~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~You are pushing me beyond breaking point, Huang!
8F582501     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~My truce with the Messina family is now in the toilet thanks to you!
DF0FF2AF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Capra's so full of shit, that's the best place for it.
25B2D919     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I think he's the rat, and I may have proof.
953FF0F4     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Really? And what 'proof' do you have?
DCCDF4BA     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Rudy D'Avanzo's got a digital recording of Capra talking to the Feds.
04CBFB65     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~And have you heard this recording?
058B6B50     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Well, not exactly.
38776D9B     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~You naive fucking child! There is no recording!
A7A852BF     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~D'Avanzo has a longstanding vendetta with the Messinas and he's using you as his muscle.
D3227671     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I don't know what shit D'Avanzo's been feeding you...
24A71903     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...but if you want to extricate yourself from this mess...
12725F0D     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...eliminate him immediately.
509E0660     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~But...
5D203B2A     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Either that or I will have to make alternative arrangements.
2A01A7FB     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~That's the kind of cut I'm looking for ... fucking, ay! That's nice. What do you think, kid?
F9532EE3     //  ~#FF06~Goombah~#FF00~~n~It's a little too dramatic for me, Rudy.
5A134110     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~You want drama, kid? I've got this gook, a real fucking idiot Triad,
3C1B58C3     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~running around stirring up all kinds of trouble for Capra.
4F787311     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~I don't know if it's comedy or tragedy, but it's real dramatic.
D7FDC6B9     //  ~#FF06~Goombah~#FF00~~n~You've got a Triad hitting the Messinas, Rudy? I thought they were friends with the noodle-pushers.
DF7584C1     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~They are - which just makes it funnier.
7815EB20     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~I told this gook that Capra was ratting the Triads out to the Feds,
C00236EF     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~and he was so desperate to nail this rat he just believed me.
571142A0     //  ~#FF06~Goombah~#FF00~~n~Heh! Heh! Fucking simpleton.
24254468     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You think you're so fucking cle...
A8E70D6B     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~...Fuck you! My father used to look at me like that! So fucking judgemental!
C6757935     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...?
952EC672     //  ~#FF06~Goombah~#FF00~~n~Stop judging my boss, you bitch!
6956C130     //  ~#FF00~That's Rudy's car.~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~Boss Wu Lee sent us to help you rout out that traitor Chan.
09CF9E95     //  ~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~Hey! I remember you! You recruited me a while back.
08BDA0CC     //  ~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~...And I've still got that shitty tattoo you gave me.
C5B2676C     //  ~#FF09~Triad~#FF00~~n~...Thanks man! My wife thinks I'm an asshole.
055AC862     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Don't mention it.
259D42E3     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Come on let's do this!
45FBBBD6     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~You've got it all wrong Huang! I'm not the traitor. You have to believe me!
34EC3AF9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You and Zhou are named in the FIB file as their rats,
0D052633     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~No! Why would I do that? I was to take over from my father.
737717B8     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~It was all supposed to have been mine!
D98C2994     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Someone set us up ... it wasn't me Huang ... it wasn't me...
906F00D7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You fucking liar! It's guys like you who give rich, nepotistic jerks a bad name.
C7AC28BE     //  Kenny has sent some hired muscle to help you route Chan from his hiding place.
23AC56F3     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Please! I'll give you a wank!
BEDAA75D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...you trans-sexual loving creep.
21FA8EAD     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Sure, I can be a little hot headed and foolish, but I'm a good guy.
2F14DCCA     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~I help people. I like animals and flowers.
CBC6B19B     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~Yesterday I made a video of some young female gymnasts...
9F8CDE34     //  ~#FF09~Chan~#FF00~~n~...showering and it was ... beautiful.~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~My father is dead: murdered in Kowloon.
02FA9569     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~He always told me that this life, the life of a gangster, can be short, even for a boss.
274D03B7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Most of the family believes he died while meditating at the temple.
5534DF77     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~The truth is he was worshipping other gods - his two favorites.
34002537     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Pharmaceutical grade coke and cheap women.
BA64E448     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Regardless - I have sworn on his grave to find those responsible, to avenge him.
988CFB82     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I did this mostly so as to guarantee my inheritance, but also because the old man was a good guy...
E60EFDE9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...for a philandering, drug addled murderer.
5758F0BC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~'Yu Jian' - his sword, generations old, has always been in the keeping of the head of the family.
40237D66     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~A tradition my father invented after winning the sword in a card game.
6630DD6F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Now, I've got to deliver the stupid thing to the family's new patriarch...
01948F23     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Uncle Wu 'Kenny' Lee, in that great American melting pot Liberty City.
EC91E0E2     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~The last time I visited Liberty City, I caught crabs off a Swiss tourist.
235AC512     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Still, even a pampered little snot like me shouldn't be able to bungle delivering a sword...
FDE8C5C0     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...to a moody and power crazy uncle...
E6E7BC62     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...with a penchant for exotic pornography and impersonating people out of kung fu films.
2AE83C78     //  ~#FEF1~Sometimes though, even the simplest of jobs don't work out quite the way you expect them to...
8988143D     //  ~#FF09~Bodyguard~#FF00~~n~Mr. Lee? ...Huang Lee?
4A97C1D8     //  ~#FF09~Bodyguard~#FF00~~n~Your uncle sent us to meet you.
2F1233A8     //  ~#FF09~Bodyguard~#FF00~~n~Fuck! We're being jumped! It's a fucking ambush!
82509A9C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Uhh, my head...
535FB962     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Shit...it's the ambushers.
9015472D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~This must be the famous American welcome I've heard so much about.
7396641A     //  ~#FF09~Smart-ass Assassin~#FF00~~n~...I think he's dead.
DF5D5A32     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~Are you sure?
DEF03E0A     //  ~#FF09~Smart-ass Assassin~#FF00~~n~...Well, he certainly looks it. He's got blood coming out of a bullet wound on his head.
FF8FD572     //  ~#FF09~Smart-ass Assassin~#FF00~~n~Tends to lead to death...being shot in the head.
5F9CB72D     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~Check him. Fucking smart ass prick.
41CB3395     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~If you're so fucking clever, how come you have to rob people for a living?
69F10F90     //  ~#FF09~Smart-ass Assassin~#FF00~~n~He's not moving. He's not breathing. He's got a bullet wound to the head.
FD954B92     //  ~#FF09~Smart-ass Assassin~#FF00~~n~You know what, I'm gonna stake my reputation on this one. The kid is dead.
7EC21D87     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~Aw, Shit! Then we are fucked.
E68FABE0     //  ~#FF09~Smart-ass Assassin~#FF00~~n~What are we gonna do?
4A7B3567     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~I thought you were the guy with the brains? Let me think.
389BCDAE     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~We're going to have to dump him.
1C968CD4     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~They're dumping me...
18F32DD7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...I might actually get out of this madness alive...
CE5971CA     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...if I don't die of shock first, of course.
7BFC3123     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...As soon as they stop the car, I'll make my move...
AA091F16     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...They won't suspect a thing.
61727124     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~Heads up...
D445BFC2     //  ~#FF06~Unsure Assassin~#FF00~~n~Okay, genius, bail!
25200E7C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's clearly not my day.
B90FA573     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What a place! Beaten up, shot and nearly drowned - within minutes of getting here.
8572FD2D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~My father would've paid for this kind of fun, but it's never appealed to me.
A9D41D0E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...I'd better find a car and get over to Uncle Kenny's.
E92B12B4     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Huang! I'd heard you'd been killed!
E2A2C5AE     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Thank all that is good that you are alive.
F0C08EC9     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~What happened?
177B0B2D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I was hoping for a couple of strippers...
2643037C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...and a VIP table in a club.
C4F8D65E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Instead, I was ambushed, robbed...
6E999620     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...and left for dead, Uncle.
CA8FEEA9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Not much of a welcome.
5F1930AA     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Just like your father. A playboy, not a worker.
9DDD03B7     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~These are dangerous times, Huang, but we will find and deal with these killers.
193EECAB     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...Do you have the sword?
37E3C0F4     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...Do you have Yu Jian?
187D565E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I think the murderers took it...
2502BB7B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...either that or your useless bodyguards.
49497993     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Don't get snotty with me, you little brat.
A7D2BD33     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I had promised Yu Jian as a gift to our leader...
47E4F048     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...Hsin Jaoming.
C98F4348     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It would have gained me great favor with him...
5BE29A2F     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...perhaps even sealing my position...
D4458775     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...as his replacement when he steps down.
E44C54E4     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Its loss will irreparably damage my standing.
0F116454     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~My honor is besmirched!
08CBEDF5     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Besmirched? Uncle, it is 2009, not 1403.
98F2DA6D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And you were going to give the sword away? But, it's been in our family for generations.
8F3B3FA5     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Don't give me that bullshit. Your father won the thing in a card game.
FC9885FF     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~As a gift to Hsin it would have made me the Triad boss here in Liberty City.
DBE71B0A     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...Huang, your father was a good man, but he's dead now, and that puts me in charge.
68D9AA8C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I have to do what is best for the family, even if it goes against our traditions...
9010281C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...and my desires.
15567270     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I have arranged an apartment for you. Rest there for a while.
EC99FF45     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~We will speak again soon, once we have both calmed down. Grief can be very unsettling.
C43DBD17     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So can being shot in the head and nearly drowned.
C98F4348     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It would have gained me great favor with him...
5BE29A2F     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...perhaps even sealing my position...

A461FCC8     //  ~#FEF0~This is your apartment. When you load a saved game you will start at your nearest apartment.
0363E362     //  ~#FEF0~You can find your apartment again by looking for ~#FF06~~#FF1C~ ~#FF00~on your radar.

08949C71     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Being unable to present Hsin with the sword, as I'd promised...
69EC7313     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...has forced me to step down as a potential heir for our leader.
C624FD78     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm sorry, Uncle, but as soon as we get the sword back, you'll be able to reclaim your position.
60977313     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Meanwhile, my father remains dead.
3B5F55CA     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...but recovering the sword...
E0DA2C86     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...is no longer the most pressing matter.

EEA01FE1     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~My businesses are being threatened by ignoble street punks who think I'm finished.
496FE2FE     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~They kick someone when they are down. I knew a proverb about that once, but I forgot it.
FDECAB5C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?
61072A89     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~No.
156BE748     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Look before you leap?
6D402130     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~No. Anyway, that's not important right now.
5C4F705A     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~What is important is that I'm getting buggered by a lot of dudes, and that is not my scene.
FBA193DE     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It's war, Nephew. I need you to get some weapons training.
07EBDB3B     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~And Huang - despite the horrors of your father's death, I am glad you're here.
04B0DE79     //  DO NOT REMOVE
46FF2CD0     //  ~#FF0C~Unknown~#FF00~~n~DO NOT REMOVE

2CEC5F6F     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~I could teach you a thing or two, Huang Lee.
4D5D49A2     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I bet you could, but I'm not that easy.
2E8BC156     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Listen, if you want to stay alive in this city, you'd better learn how to defend yourself ... can you fight at all?
BB765C0B     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Show me your best punch.
BFE2D122     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Not bad. You've got good legs.
6082B16C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I could say the same for you.
9AA1A7C1     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~I'm sure those lines usually work, but I'm also sure you usually pay for women.
8754EFD0     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I buy ALL my friends. Makes life easier.
E39E7108     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Nice. I think I like this lonely rich kid act. It kind of suits you. Can you use a gun?
48245D73     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~...Show me how you handle your piece...
5ED5DEDE     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I can certainly try.

F42E52CD     //  ~#FF06~Waiter~#FF00~~n~No wonder we're getting pissed on by every dog in town.
7409A971     //  ~#FF06~Waiter~#FF00~~n~Some thugs have dragged the boss around back.

C1A476D8     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~I always keep weapons hidden in dumpsters all over the city for emergencies just like this.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~My honorable reputation is in the gutter. I'm finished Huang! Finished!
A9ED11DB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Really Uncle? Did your wife find your video collection?
3191CDD0     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~All of my street dealers are abandoning me. All my years as a noble outlaw are coming to nothing.
F2BF5BA4     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Uncle, let me help. What are you dealing: counterfeit goods, stolen merchandise?
6E12B096     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~My stock is more 'pharmaceutical' in nature...
2C4403F2     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...the kind that's difficult to legally source.
9696AB95     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Of course - You're a drug lord.
8144B496     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~A NOBLE drug lord!
21830602     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Is there any other kind?
537F1D9B     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~But, I don't think I want you getting involved in the drugs trade, Huang.
49BED52B     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~You're young and will just end up tripped out on ecstasy, with a needle full of skag in your eye...
E2DA26F2     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...and midgets blowing coke up your ass ... And it'll be all my fault!
FD0625C2     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Your father would expect me to protect you.
9CB371A8     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What powerful images, Uncle! But I can handle myself.
09CCE10D     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I knew I could count on you to uphold our traditions and finally become a man!
82DB1AA2     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I've already taken the liberty of having some 'samples' delivered to your apartment.
2C15913E     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~There's a fine merchant in East Island City who'll be happy to take them off your hands.
7C6B85CD     //  ~#FF09~Liam~#FF00~~n~Man, that's good shit - I can feel my dick shrinking already.
425D9E48     //  ~#FF09~Liam~#FF00~~n~I'll have to get on the Mollis later. Now listen.
63A79F82     //  ~#FF09~Liam~#FF00~~n~There's a bit of an issue right now. Those security cameras.
A0703B9A     //  ~#FF09~Liam~#FF00~~n~Every fool in town is getting arrested. Very good for those of us who haven't gone down.
4D5FC9E3     //  ~#FF09~Liam~#FF00~~n~Until they come down, prices will just stay high...
8E3ACD5A     //  ~#FF09~Liam~#FF00~~n~...sorry friend - that's capitalism - supply and demand, baby.
EC636808     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Shit! It's the cops!~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Even simple store owners are choosing to forget that their security is best served...
81255AFD     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...by the noble protection I extend them.
B4FBB13A     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~If they refuse to pay for my services, how am I supposed to look after them?
516DFABA     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It's for the greater good that they realize bad things like explosive fires...
81D1AA16     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...accidental deaths and such like, happen to those without my protection.
11111112     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Explosive fires?
382D0718     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...You want me to burn these stores down?
66A31A40     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~No, Huang, that would be dishonorable and bad for business.
B66751C0     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...You need only make an example of one.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...A wealthy buyer of expensive stolen artifacts is visiting the city.
42E92EF0     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~... Do you think he might be here to buy Yu Jian?
1670C4F4     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It's possible - and though some say it's dishonorable to attack lone travelers...
D0B0DC96     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...I say, a rich fool can be the cause of much mischief.
FC43DE30     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I've always had a way with words.
81585B7D     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Thank you nephew.
CCD9F302     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I couldn't have bought this place without you.
5230A83D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Of course! Anyway, I'm glad I could help.
61C47C60     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Any news on my father's killers, or that silly sword, Yu Jian?
F98ABBF4     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Possibly...
C34746E9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I? I thought it was for us?
6570BDC0     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It is! I meant we. I wrote my name on the deeds purely for tax purposes.
9EB2AB8B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~That's brilliant Uncle.
0913D9BB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~If the life of crime thing goes wrong, you should take up script writing.
39D7B20F     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Huang, it's our noble duty to separate such fools from their money.
19F046FB     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Ah, my diligent nephew. Do you have the money I asked for?
D871B265     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm working on it, Uncle.
A0D7C628     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~You're working on it? Well how about working on it harder and showing me some familial solidarity?
7499EF31     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~By the wispy beards of our forefathers! It's not like I need the money, Huang - it's only a paltry $5000!
773AB3D5     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~This is your opportunity to show me that you're more than just an errand runner.
5A458320     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm sorry, Uncle, I've been too busy running your errands to realize.
9D213452     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Get out of my sight, and don't come back until you're ready to pull your weight in this family.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~My men are all girly-boys!
B0C7F40F     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I need new blood, Huang - men prepared to fight and die for me.
663C617A     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Not this scum that defect to other under-bosses simply because I've fallen out of favor with Hsin.
23EAAE73     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~For generations men have given their lives meaning by dying in this family's service!
7315EB2F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Absolutely ... it's the most honorable of traditions.
34CD58C8     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~There's surely many immigrants on the streets...
A10AAB9C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...all suffering regular abuse from the authorities and local punks.
FD782A5E     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Find these terribly unfortunate souls, Huang, and show them a life of honor is worth dying for.
46FF2CD0     //  ~#FF0C~Unknown~#FF00~~n~DO NOT REMOVE
160D251F     //  ~#FF09~Rookie~#FF00~~n~You saved me! How can I ever repay you?
13AF0F5B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~No need to repay me, but I can help you help yourself.
59F80907     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Join my gang, and you'll learn important qualities like discipline and self respect...
823DDA88     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...and how to intimidate and bully people yourself.
81350C95     //  ~#FF09~Rookie~#FF00~~n~Fantastic! As a Triad, all my troubles will be over!~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~We have taught the Spanish Lords the error of their thieving ways.
49307A5D     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It's time to give them a lesson in the art of noble conduct.
A5E7D423     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~And trust me, my boy, nothing says 'nobility' like murder...
109F3C52     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...theft, and kicking someone when they are down.
7635484D     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~We will raid this warehouse...
798EE807     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...where their most valuable merchandise is held...
C2982882     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...but, unlike those thieving dogs, we will only take that which is rightfully ours.
0437935E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Then we'll destroy the place and kill a shit load of the bastards?
089836E5     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Obviously. What do you take me for? A metrosexual on a cleanse?
C3E1854F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Never uncle! Do you think we will find that stupid sword...
CF1EFEA8     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Yu Jian, there?
3D1182FA     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Maybe. ...Perhaps we should take everything - just to be certain.
EBC92980     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Then destroy the place and kill a lot of them. Just for good form's sake.
B9B26827     //  ~#FF00~Be careful, the warehouse is guarded.
90906F8D     //  ~#FF00~That storage van looks like an ideal target.
46FF2CD0     //  ~#FF0C~Unknown~#FF00~~n~DO NOT REMOVE
AB9CDBAC     //  Be careful, the compound is guarded!~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Animals! Filth! Scum! They know nothing of honor or nobility!
C392C9DD     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~All they do is steal and kill and prance about like girls!
9F7CA232     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~What kind of real man dances?
D812222F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Uncle?
4D2151BD     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~These animals could be the ones who stole Yu Jian.
7524B3F7     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I'm sure they've been behind most of the attacks on us since its loss.
61FB730C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Even now they're preparing to assault businesses that are under my protection! Heathens!
0FAFE4FF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What are you talking about? Who?
3940E1F1     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Those moronic Spanish Lords! Uphold my good name, Huang. Slaughter them all!
18BF3587     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~For the love of your family and all that is holy!
E336F6CD     //  Use vehicles to barricade both ends of the street before the Spanish Lords arrive.
8BD8C34A     //  Park vehicles in these positions to create barricades.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Our noble house will come to a dishonorable end unless we defend ourselves.
ADE90ABB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Absolutely. Also if anyone ever seizes your hard drive or DVD collection.
CEA8B99B     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Funny time to be cracking jokes, you little snot.
318048A8     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~You enraged the Spanish Lords and now they're coming to try to destroy me!
534E3075     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Yes - and it wasn't like you told me to attack them or anything, was it?
98626C93     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I told you to deal with the problem - what a great fucking job you did!
6650665B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Oh, I'm sorry Uncle. Sorry I came here, got robbed, mugged, left for dead, and that was the good bit!
942FDAA9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~My father's death remains unsolved, and I'm fighting your fucking battles. Thanks, Uncle!
BC3AF12B     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~They're here! Deal with them, Huang! It's your fault, anyway!
FABB746D     //  You have found the Spanish Lord's warehouse.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~My dear Nephew! I'm screwed!
43B90108     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I've spoken briefly with our leader, Hsin Jaoming, about the loss of the sword, Yu Jian.
B9BE02D5     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~He's not happy. There will be harsh consequences for me.
DCFB4CB6     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Well, I'm sorry to hear that Uncle, but what about the men who killed my father?
2406CFE6     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Surely that's more important than some dude and a ceremonial sword?
04FBEA5C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I'm working on it. I haven't slept with worry.
97684640     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~But Hsin's favor is vital to our family.
A5803F00     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm sure it's vital, Uncle. I'm sorry if I was disrespectful.
F2967791     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~How can I help? I'd love to go after...
08F17D6B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...the men who tried to kill me.
D70BB441     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...and rip their tongues out with pliers...
D1E00177     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~If you want to help me Nephew...
033B21BF     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...please do as I say!
DD542C6D     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~You're new here...
00E45603     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...and things aren't exactly going well for us right now, are they?
C1926749     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Listen - I need help running my business while I deal with Hsin's rage.
6C9DF9E9     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~A couple of my crew are observing a squad of undercover cops...
BCE51385     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...who are spying on an exotic movie I am financing... Purely for artistic reasons, of course.
3BB3554E     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I need you to head over there and find out why they haven't reported back to me.
5FC6A851     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Easy enough, eh?
756CE484     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Take my car. And I like the car, so do try not to get murdered again.
244AA354     //  You can also lose your wanted level by using Pay 'n' Sprays, as long as no cops see your vehicle enter the garage.

1B422576     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm his nephew, Huang Lee. Who the fuck are you?
F332F7BE     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~...Oh, you're the rich prick from Hong Kong who lost the sword ... Nice one.
9246E7AE     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And I thought Americans did not understand sarcasm. Nice hair cut!
6679EEB6     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Yeah - funny - I'm Ling Shan.
1A8314A1     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~I'm all that's left of Kenny's spies - we got jumped by the pigs...
6EAD58F8     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Do you mean those pigs?
718CDED8     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Shit! Get us out of here alive, Huang, and I'll marry you!
1A5CA775     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Yes - I know about sarcasm.

97C55EDB     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Very funny, but I better take Kenny's car back...
A117C6C7     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~...and tell him personally what happened to his exotic movie shoot and team of hard men killers.
79654898     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, I get nothing... before you go - can I ask you a question...
82B8F5AC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...were you an observer, or an actress in the "art house" movie?
5B6D283F     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~Keep it in your pants, Huang - I doubt it's very impressive.
5B2621AB     //  ~#FF09~Ling~#FF00~~n~I'll see you around.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~What has happened is most distressing.
FFA390D4     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I know. I cannot believe Ling's dead. First my dad, now this.
DCF95530     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Ling's dead? Well, yes, that's unfortunate...
8A2082E5     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...but I was talking about being attacked by nobodies. The shame of it!
B7AB4760     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What? ...How can you be so cold? Ling was a nice person.
7E40BD11     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Boo fucking hoo. Stop acting like a child. People die every day.
74A4F95A     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~It's the nature of this life we've all chosen.
5762C8F1     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Your father knew that.

0C4FBEF0     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~And avenge Ling!
D35AE4F4     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Said with true feeling, Uncle!
31D1C094     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~. . .
0C591CBE     //  ~#FF09~Thug~#FF00~~n~Hey, triad! What you doing here?
08FEA240     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm finishing what I started in Cerveza Heights.
BC5D696A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~No one fucks with my family.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Hsin's idiot son, Chan Jaoming, has had the audacity...
400F6CFB     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...the impudence, the outright insanity of asking me to work for him.
8CD8A37D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Great! This could help you regain face with Hsin.
5C28E87C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Yes, but there's not much honor in wiping Chan's ass.

0D44664A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...think so highly of me, kind Uncle.
E159EB8D     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...I'm sorry, Huang. Sorry I can't offer you better! Sorry I'm not the big boss!
817A23FA     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Sorry no one is here with a silver spoon ready to shove it up your pampered ass.
ECCF85C7     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Your father, rest his soul, ruined you!
2CAB4419     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What's the job, kind Uncle?
91F23DB9     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Chan needs to acquire some fast cars for a street race.
CD7AE808     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Now believe me, Chan is mentally subnormal...
F4A2E474     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...so the thought of him driving fast is somewhat worrying, but he seems to need them.
EAC0D0CC     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~The deadline for delivery was yesterday, so you'd better hurry.
032F37EB     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~And Huang, thank you.~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~So, that fucking sword was stolen by a secret group within the Koreans...
26584CC2     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~In that case, you were right to attack them, Huang.
8DE8E964     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Their boss's still out there ... he could be anyone.
F919F953     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Not anyone: he had Yu Jian stolen specifically to embarrass and stop me succeeding Hsin. Asshole.
8D4636CD     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, whoever this guy is, he's benefited from your loss in standing with the boss?
C9B9D737     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And let's be honest, Uncle, you look like a bit of a prick right now.
008AA2EA     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I wouldn't say prick, I'd say, tough, noble, warrior fallen on hard times, but I won't labor the point ...
A04BEC66     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~so, we would be wise to watch Chan and Zhou closely from now on.
4E96AF6D     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~A snake and a gimp.
53253003     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Do you think one of them is preparing to whack Hsin?
8B4AD169     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...I don't know, but we should get back on good terms with that stupid old bastard.
BAFE5124     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~He's been asking me to help his wonderful mob 'friends' bring a boat full of merchandise into the city.
77C05AE2     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~They should be arriving anytime now...
A0276592     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Leave it to me Uncle...
9CCC8C94     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~This is the best boat Triad money can buy?
4593E995     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You've got to be shitting me!
24370855     //  ~#FF09~Mobster~#FF00~~n~Hey, our Chinese delivery boy made it. I hope you got extra duck sauce.
EE262E27     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Very fucking funny...
AE9E1217     //  ~#FF09~Mobster~#FF00~~n~You think I'm funny? Like a clown? You think I'm a joke?
46D2B475     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I saw that film too, you cretin.
D0113470     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Now shut up and give me the gear, or I'll show you what I think about clowns.
7259A4D1     //  ~#FF09~Mobster~#FF00~~n~Okay. Okay. Jeez - take it easy. Tight ass prick.
DF0C302F     //  ~#FF09~Mobster~#FF00~~n~Say thanks to Hsin, but we'll take it from here, noodle-boy.
D76743FF     //  ~#FF09~Coast Guard~#FF00~~n~Prepare to be boarded!
55DC6CD3     //  ~#FF09~Coast Guard~#FF00~~n~You in the boat - you are under arrest! ...We aren't kidding around, Mister!~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's all there in the file, Uncle: Zhou and Chan are the Fed rats.
85837C09     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~What a predictable twist in the plot! We must get this file to Hsin as quickly as possible.
04B490BE     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~That's going to be rather difficult, now that he wants me dead.
87D9AFA3     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...You are not alone, my boy.
9A73B48C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Because I spoke up for you, Hsin now believes...
49443CA3     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...I'm as guilty as you. As if I could be a rat?
C424E7CF     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~An English friend of mine had a good word for people like him - that word was 'wanker'.
F0B79F11     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~This is no time for idle conjecture. It's time for a close up on me looking moody...
8C6D2C5C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...before I save the day.
E78E6BA8     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~He's meeting with the heads of the Tongs today...
35C52350     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...it's the perfect time to give him the file...
502710B8     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...though, there's no knowing...
62F3D9AC     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~...how he will react when he reads it.
F678144F     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Come on. I've my car. I'll drive.
A89CB350     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~The FIB report is genuine Hsin ... there is no doubt.
978E37A9     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I know it's hard to see it in black and white.
AADD3794     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Zhou and Chan! My most trusted... My own son...
4CA94FB8     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~I am ... sorry to bring you this news. But there're always others...
4679607E     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Nonsense! I taught them to be ruthless, to give no ground ...
C2403DE7     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...but their disloyalty has been uncovered.
9943D0C6     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Honor demands...
2274C8BB     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I know my own oath to the Tongs!
2DCD0129     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~The traitors must die ... 'no matter who they are'.
FB649F35     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...Leadership is a poisoned chalice ...
69F5BDE0     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I pass to you, Wu Kenny Lee.
920CB56C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Hsin?
AC018BC1     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~You will be my successor... I retire henceforth.
001B40A8     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~This is a fucking shambles.
0B5D51E0     //  ~#FF06~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Enjoy yourself. I'm off to Macau to sleep with women of easy virtue.
7B9D9889     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~This car's screwed! ...JUMP!
107F3F0C     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~Yiieeee!
C2256064     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Shiiiiiiiit!
9ECA8E73     //  ~#FF09~Kenny~#FF00~~n~You drive. I can't handle a stick shift.~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hsin?
960AAC29     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~You took your time getting here.
4C565AD4     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Lucky for you, you made it just in time to meet the inbound train.
017D8A95     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Follow him. He should be heading for their safehouse.
F35820CB     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Once I know its location, I will give you further instruction.
E38604C3     //  ~#FF09~Quarry~#FF00~~n~Some guy was following me, but I think I lost him.
EE742760     //  ~#FF06~Contact~#FF00~~n~Maybe he was just cruising... That's understandable with you carrying that fucking umbrella.
BDF22A84     //  ~#FF09~Quarry~#FF00~~n~What?
37698FC3     //  ~#FF06~Contact~#FF00~~n~Come on, let's get out of here. Fucking idiot.
90436E87     //  ~#FF00~The Korean has reached his destination: This must be the Midtown Gangsters' main safehouse.
3A0CE799     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~One of those rebellious little pricks is coming in on that train.
C3D5AC0D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Thanks. And may I say, I love the patronizing old turd act you've got going on.~#FF09~Chen~#FF00~~n~Hsin has given us the authority to do 'whatever it takes' to get those files...
45C7ACD7     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~'Whatever it takes'? Why don't we just ask to see them?
AF7B5509     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~They are supposed to be loyal to Hsin, right? Nobody needs to get hurt.
AFE4F0BD     //  ~#FF09~Chen~#FF00~~n~I wonder why Hsin thinks you're the rat? You're more like the village idiot.
0CE62C01     //  ~#FF09~Chen~#FF00~~n~Come on, let's go and pick up some toys.
6B80344D     //  ~#FF09~Chen~#FF00~~n~Seems you're not mentioned in the files Huang. Hsin will be disappointed.
AA5B383D     //  ~#FF09~Chen~#FF00~~n~You can go, but remember... we'll be watching you.
DEB8D957     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You're a dick. You know that? A dick.~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~The underhand dogs' weapons shipment is arriving right now.
404E5EBE     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~I cannot allow a subordinate gang to stockpile heavy weapons they might use against us.
2C48B3E2     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Sometimes, the hardest thing about being a parent is letting go.
CF9E69A7     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Destroy their weapons and all those involved ... if you can.
C9040795     //  The Korean gangbangers are escaping on that boat with their weapons.
7CAEF74A     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~It makes my blood boil and my power of metaphor reach breaking point.
53B17317     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Shut your fucking mouth, you little cunt.~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Though that gang of Koreans isn't speaking to the Feds...
9392AA7D     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~...their leader wants independence from us:
14D4DB7E     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Their effrontery must be disciplined!
F686539F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Let me guess...you want me to go and blow some shit up...
10D09CEE     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Err, yes ...I've left some explosives around the back of the building.
D80C3CA8     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~Destroy their main hideout...
8A3DD3AE     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~... and though I grow weary waiting for my sword, I may allow you further time to find it.
2041DF91     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...in a subtle but powerful statement of your authority?
84A3B80E     //  ~#FF09~Hsin~#FF00~~n~And Huang, I hope it goes without saying, but fuck this up, and I will fuck you up.~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~I know our people don't usually get along, but things have gotta change if we're all gonna survive.
16A0D177     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm deeply touched that you care about the Triads, Mr. D'Avanzo, but I just need the rat's name.
E4B8A951     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~You're touched? That's nice.
D21AE12C     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Listen, once this rat's put you lot inside...
2A5F6355     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~...he's gonna start doing the same thing to us.
85323B2C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, just give me his name and we can all live happily ever after.
367F7395     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Apart from him, of course. He'll live not so happily for not that long.
63015448     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~We've gotta be real careful. I think he's onto me...
6A71F5AD     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~His men could be here any minute looking for me.
B05F226F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~His name.
5A809C8F     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~... Jimmy Capra - a Messina made man - the same guy who's currently being real friendly with your boss.
87BB959B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~A wiseguy - it figures.
47BFAB19     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So how come YOU don't take him out?
9C4AB82E     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~The Messinas and my people have been enemies for years.
B6958080     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~We'd never get close enough...
E9C0EC10     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...But a Triad could - now that we're all buddies - right?
AF6FEBE8     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~You're a fucking natural. This is gonna work out just fine.~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~We hid a digital recorder in Jimmy Capra's car.
52E3D1F4     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~By now it'll be full of evidence proving he's the Feds' rat ...and probably a cross-dresser too.
A8DC8103     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~We need that recorder, so we're gonna need his car, and you're the perfect guy to steal it.
E5A7A5A1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Capra might be friendly with the Triads...
466ED2EE     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...but his greaseball mobsters...no offense...
296C035C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...aren't going to let me just steal his car.
F8AE239D     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Of course not! They're not going to let ANYONE take it!
56B1EC47     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~But, an eggroll like you - no offense - can get closer to it than any of my guys.
53F483C5     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~It should be parked over at the Messina's Boulevard compound ...Lots of luck.
1EC4AA47     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Why didn't you plant a bug like a normal person? I thought you were a wise guy?
342B9AED     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~And I thought you were bringing me take out. Because they sweep for radio signals, genius.
FE337D76     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Now get on with it.
50154FB4     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Good job. Once we've dug the digital recorder out of this piece of shit, I'll be in touch.~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Have you got the copy of that recording ... for my boss.
2CC41CD9     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~What recording?
F1393035     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~The one that proves Capra is the Fed rat.
EFC2B15A     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Oh, that one. Relax! As soon as we're done...
B78FCE5D     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~...you can have it.
6BE0B475     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Done?
E5B3CA06     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Capra wants to meet me for peace talks. But, the only peace I'm gonna give him is 'rest in peace'!
EB5EAC2E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Cool pun! I bet you've been working on that all day.
55FAC2B3     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~And I want you there, making sure the right guy gets shot.
6B95AE8E     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~The meeting's just between me and Capra: I should be able to handle him...
86EB036B     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~....but there's a sniper rifle on the roof for you...
3A408939     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~...just in case things turn a little sour.
94A5BBD4     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~I'll take the car.
64261984     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Hey, Capra! ...Where are you? I hope you came alone like we agreed.
064B1249     //  ~#FF06~Capra~#FF00~~n~Of course I did, Rudy - you know me - I'm a man of honor.
2AEB9897     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Must be nice to have that luxury...
03618457     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~...they can write that on your tombstone.
9DFA916B     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Hey! What are these fucks doing here?
D83DB2F6     //  ~#FF06~Capra~#FF00~~n~Maybe you should plan your own obituary first, friend.~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~You did great. The recording from Capra's car proves he's been talking to the Feds. A lot.
FADF7D25     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Can I have that recording?
E4BAC83F     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Why? You don't trust me? I'm telling you what it says.
159D959C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Trust? In this town? Don't be ridiculous.
833092C1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I need to clear things with my boss.
6B731465     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~Sure, I'll get you a copy of it, little man ...
8F813487     //  ~#FF09~D'Avanzo~#FF00~~n~just as soon as you've whacked all the rats named on it.~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Well, if it isn't the star of my show!
5A799478     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~That's right. It isn't.
8A8E33E9     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I beg to differ.
F2665E0B     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Chan's given you to me as my guide and protector - a knowing Virgil to my innocent Dante - as I chart the corrupting pit of hell you methnecks live in.
2106AB04     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's good to see unprejudiced reporting isn't dead.
2CC56F38     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I'm sorry if the truth hurts, but integrity and impartiality - the truth and nothing but - are how I roll.
FE3F033A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Sure. I predict a bright future for you at the networks.
9E86F04B     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Like I need career critique from a professional criminal.
235EF572     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Come on. Let's get to the docks. Chan's got a huge shipment of drugs arriving.
7F83F690     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I want to get close to the action, and shoot my first footage.
D162837F     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~You drive. I'm gonna get my cameras ready.
4B8C78F5     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm gonna take a look and make sure everything's cool.
C63E4821     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I'll come with you.
F399C350     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~No. I don't know what line Chan fed you, but if these guys see you filming them - you're dead.
F38F4EFB     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Chan said I could shoot anything I wanted!
4267008F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Take a camera in there and you'll be the one getting shot. Chan would be pretty pissed if that happened.
FB52AD30     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I don't care!
D8455927     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Well, I do. Don't get me wrong it's not you I'm thinking about.
BD3DB2C5     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~...Freedom of the press?
0E012211     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Look, shoot your footage from inside the van.
9C738250     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~This is pointless! ...Okay! Okay! I'll stay in the van... I promise.
A19446E1     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Oh, my God! You killed those guys... I can't believe it.
F57C686E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What did you expect? It's not like I'm gonna call the cops.
58BAF93E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~"Help! Police! Our massive illicit drug shipment is being ripped off!"
F8ECABD0     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Funny. Well, laugh this one up: I did call the cops.
D537EEC2     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What?
7838C39B     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Well, what did you expect me to do? I was crapping myself!
A77AFC07     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You stupid bitch!
C03A6342     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Hey! You were supposed to be protecting me while I was filming!
F45B3381     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I was kinda busy - maybe you noticed!
B70894A6     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Look, if you wanna keep that footage, you'd better get out of here before your cops arrive.
2E3427B9     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Go!~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
E2D80C99     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Don't get all teary-eyed. I'm here because Chan's paying.
63CA4629     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~My hero.
D91BA52A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Exactly. So, you won't need to call the cops this time.
726A0232     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Well, try protecting me this time.
E3CF504F     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I need to get some footage of a drug factory.
AEC4898E     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Chan won't let me see any of his, but he's told me about this place run by the Yardies.
D8FF96DA     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~He won't let you see any of his factories because the moron doesn't have any. So instead, he wants me to walk you through a rival's factory.
89FAB81B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Maybe I could do a full media presentation mid way through, pointing out the profitable operating principles of the place...
E210265D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...whilst dodging bullets, using a laser pointer to distract crazed Yardies.
691FDBD7     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Actually, I think his plan was for you to tear the place apart while I filmed it.
1F34C2DC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Oh! ...Okay. Let's go.
0D84A4BF     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~This is the place!
7221C29E     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Come on! I'm already rolling!
53326D3C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hey! I thought I was the one who's supposed to charge in shooting wildly. Heh! Heh!
D15A0468     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Oh, please! Is this really the time for levity? People are about to die.
0F72C7BB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Only of we go through this door. Of course you wouldn't get your footage if we didn't.
422141DC     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~...Can't you just shoot the guns out of their hands?
FB092C2C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I find the best way to make someone drop their gun is to shoot them in the head.
7BDC24D0     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~So, try to keep out of my way in there, it's gonna get really messy.
343EF428     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Oh, shit! Grenades!
BE2B5F57     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~What? Arghhh!
04DA2B6F     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~This is awful! They weren't gangsters. They were probably forced to work here...How can you live with yourself?
F7DF9132     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Will you give me a break? You got your footage didn't you?
E5A34700     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~I'm just doing my job!
5F8A9238     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Then let me do mine! Move out of the way. I'm going to open the safe.
204657B9     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~...Hey, I recognize that dead guy. It's Vince Vacant, Channel 15's ace investigative reporter.
00C55B15     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~He must have been doing an undercover piece on this place...
11DB4F5F     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Oh, my God! You know what this means?
1922E9CA     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You filmed yourself aiding and abetting a known killer?
5D7292A5     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~...There's gonna be an opening at Channel 15! This is great!
3F32E16B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Nice girl.
29A9443E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Let's get out of here.~#FF06~Xai~#FF00~~n~Listen, Chan just came into possession of a fuck load of this new shit.
1E9B43A1     //  ~#FF06~Xai~#FF00~~n~It's highly addictive and more toxic than the Humboldt at high tide...
B3FF4183     //  ~#FF06~Xai~#FF00~~n~...so don't be surprised if you get chased round by street crazies screaming for more.
F42C0219     //  ~#FF06~Xai~#FF00~~n~Toss some of this shit out to the usual junkies and crack whores and see what sticks.
0B676E38     //  ~#FF06~Xai~#FF00~~n~Enjoy!
55EF6913     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Highly addictive and toxic? Nice... and this is the stuff you're gonna 'market' to unsuspecting people?
B0C21330     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's their choice. I'm not going to force it on anyone.
956C1355     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Choice? You're aiming it at crack whores and junkies! Seriously, doesn't any of this bother you?
CA628B3F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~As long as it pays, I'm only too happy to help the self destructive achieve their ambitions. Come on, let's get moving.
663873E4     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Wait! I'll grab my camera.
1265A4CA     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Well... that was different.
31400410     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm glad you had fun.
55BC4009     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~Fun? Only a greedy, self-centered, sociopath would think any of that was fun.
2CC18B74     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'll take that as a yes then.
605FF549     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~How dare you? There's no comparison between us, maniac!
69853E10     //  ~#FF09~Mel~#FF00~~n~You're destroying decent society for respectable people. My job, my calling, is to show your kind up as the monsters you are.
5945746A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Gaining fame, fortune, and having fun, doing it.

00F8EF55     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~Tell me, have you time on your comedy tour to do any real work?

128399E3     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What was it? Clean your room?
3C5F94F3     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~The job's worth a fortune, but it needs two to pull it off.
B908F3D1     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~I had a partner: Perfect for this job, but some asshole got her killed.
775F418B     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~Seeing as you think you're Kenny's resident tough guy ...

731C79E5     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~I'll be doing the real work.
4FE52CDE     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~You'll just be having fun distracting the cops in a N.O.O.S.E. tank.

C73D07FC     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~Or - you look bad, Xin, I'll get you to a doctor.

3C23F560     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~Gone towards my dead partner's funeral expenses.
0D02CDD7     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~I thought you wouldn't mind, seeing as it was you that killed her.
9CDFD2E8     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~What? ...You're delirious.
1C754DD2     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~She was my SISTER! MY FUCKING SISTER! ...
943CC890     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~You let her die, right here in the alley!

672CF8D5     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~Bullshit! If you'd been half as good as you think you are, you wouldn't have failed her.
174830B1     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~You think you're fucking great, but you're fucking useless!
CC9578CE     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Really? Well, where were you when she needed you?
AB4779A5     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~She was your partner, your sister.
6BB4CD78     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~I couldn't... I was - this isn't about me!
626926DD     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Wrong. This is all about you.
B30519B9     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~But, I didn't... It was you!
2F1B4EBD     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You failed her, kid, not me.
FEFD85AA     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~...I ... I'm sorry.
38E0AA9A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Look, I've lost someone recently too.
F5BEC983     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~It's hard, but you get used to it.
D6C19F9C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Get yourself patched up, kid.
4949B39E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And when you're better, look me up.
D2EC2C69     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hey! Maybe we could be partners.
3C2C9FA6     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I could use a side-kick ...
039857A1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~especially one like an annoying kid-brother.
2A424775     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~...Huh! A useless kid-brother.
7963E024     //  ~#FF09~Xin~#FF00~~n~...Fucking useless.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I've heard a few good things about you.
568BEB4C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Uh, no not really.
F0A4E2A1     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Ah, you must lead a sheltered life.
36ECDE8D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~No wonder you're working for that moron Chan Jaoming.
AAA8031E     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Well, I can save you from that life of wiping a rich guy's ass.
E67BA4E9     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Working with me, you can play your part in saving the Triads:
3AD45565     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Chan Jaoming must NEVER become our new boss.
19B2707D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~He's educationally subnormal.
B60F555B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Let me hazard a guess here...
235CF9DC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...the only hope is to make you the new leader?
F5C76034     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...even that old guy can't do anything so stupid as to overlook me.
023B441B     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Look, all the Tongs favor me. I just need to get Hsin on board.
59DCE678     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~We have to make it so obvious I'm the best choice so that...
47F0CBA9     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I'd like to test you out on a score that's about to go down. You can be my new 'thrower'.
93D62078     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Thrower?
7EAF847D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~You'll see...
9A14A93B     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~The gift you brought me is greatly appreciated, Huang Lee.
CDFAB570     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~And, no doubt, you've heard a lot of pretty great things of me.
32B918F5     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Unless you like it.
2DAEA358     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Obviously. Look, I realize I would say that, being an arrogant guy on the make,
E84C75BD     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...but old Uncle Kenny ain't cutting it no more,
47D85363     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~and Chan couldn't cut his way out of a paper prison.
912B2891     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I'll drive from here on in. You sneak onto that delivery truck, and toss its merchandise over to me.
8D9B465A     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I know I'm arrogant, but let's be honest, I'm kind of incredible.
8597A5DB     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Often, people are a constant source of disappointment for me, Huang.
BFE14C84     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~But you have impressed me. Your skills - when compared to mine - might be nearly adequate.
37C35B44     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Zhou, I'm all for masking one's insecurities, but I've got to ask...
78AC6990     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...have you got a tiny penis? They can do things for it nowadays.
C51C5AE6     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~That's the spirit.
D23613BE     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I'm talking about winning a war, and you're talking about penile augmentation.
B6907BC4     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Seriously, Huang - this town is there for the taking. You and me.
D27EB204     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Call on me again soon, so that your education may continue.
F21365FB     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~And since you ask, no. It's massive.
82A14500     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm Huang Lee. Are you Zhou?
F7308E1A     //  ~#FF09~Noh~#FF00~~n~No.
C055F6A8     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Is he around?
F7308E1A     //  ~#FF09~Noh~#FF00~~n~No.
653E5345     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Well, when will he be back?
FF8D5E93     //  ~#FF09~Noh~#FF00~~n~No. No.
39D4603D     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...No? You don't speak English do you?
FF8D5E93     //  ~#FF09~Noh~#FF00~~n~No. No.
CB4B8E65     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~That's just great! How about Cantonese? ...Mandarin?
62B98E88     //  ~#FF09~Noh~#FF00~~n~No....No.
EFA570CC     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You're pretty 'short' on answers big boy.
96296A1E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Is 'no' the only word you know?
99239A24     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Hey! Only assholes say 'no'...
BABFC112     //  ~#FF09~Noh~#FF00~~n~No. Fuck off, kid. Come back when you've got the stuff Zhou asked for.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~In his final months as boss, Hsin Jaoming is losing the respect...
EB7F07DC     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...of several major business associates and dealers.
5C720E56     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~These fools act disgracefully!
B125B66B     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Their obedience to our leader should be absolute.
E7BFA393     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~To bring them back in line, Hsin is going to blow up the vehicles...
E69DDB55     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...in which they've stashed their drugs.
EFD37B23     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...And we're going to help?
108DFF8F     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Fuck no!
42010E3D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~You're going to stop Hsin's bomb vans...
3C56C8E2     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...so that I can safely steal the drugs,
2E56F2E7     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...then present myself...
A3255EE3     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...as the only competent operator. It's win-win.
F42A183C     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...Huang, you've got to grow up.
FD0AD926     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~My cars now ... and my drugs too.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Even though we have disciplined the dealers who insulted Hsin with their disrespect,
448D15D0     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~for justice to be truly done, they must be taught a more serious lesson.
23A73C1F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Would that lesson be 'next time you're reincarnated, get life insurance?'
58855636     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Something like that. I asked them if they wanted to cut me in,
A4BF67FE     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~and they refused and threatened to run to Hsin and start bitching and moaning like women,
F1E51D98     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~so the fuckers are going to have to be shut up.
62D2E12B     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Yet again I have delivered Hsin's justice...like an avenging angel, or indomitable god...
9A95B21B     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...or something else a bit like that.
1E0F7C3F     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~But, as usual, I get treated like a fucking butler.
8C85719A     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Your humility is awe inspiring.
6C8B7D32     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Indeed, I have inspired myself.
C7CC34B7     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I've grown tired of looking for favors from chumps.
093DF27D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I will be the next leader of the Triad, with or without Hsin's approval.
823DFC44     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~It is only a matter of time.
E9E64D4E     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~That must be some good coke.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Back so soon? ...You must be eager to help make me the new boss.
7BD08D5F     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I know when to back a winner.
84450C7F     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Me too, which is why I always back myself.
05CF2D0E     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~In business, pleasure, wrestling, sex, you name it. I'm a winner.
5434525F     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Listen, I have an old friend being flown to the city on medical release.
AF31342C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Medical release?
91B09F00     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~He's a con, but not for much longer ... you're going to free him and bring him here.
E90093DD     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~His plane's already landed, so be quick getting to the airport.
0A5BA92C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I'm going to take your word for it on some of those.
A69AC1C8     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~My old friend ... I bet you thought you'd never see me again.
204F8EA8     //  ~#FF06~Uri~#FF00~~n~Zhou ...I ...I meant to stay in touch.
7893B98D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~You owe me a pound of flesh, Uri, remember...
DB94DBB7     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...And I fully intend to get to the 'heart' of the matter.
0382979B     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~If you'd wanted him dead, why didn't you tell me?
3DF602B2     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~What's the matter Huang - am I being heartless?
BF72CD1E     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...I can quickly remedy that.
C40A6110     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Now we've killed together, you and I are friends, Huang.
7C07F2EA     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Blood brothers.
EB24CE8B     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...Don't be a stranger.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Huang, today we will be joining the festivities in Chinatown.
743E2344     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~They're celebrating 100 years of slave wages, washing filthy laundry...
7A1DA1AA     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...roach infested kitchens, and opium abuse.
7DE6CC14     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You're like a walking clich machine...
5EFD7BC1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...my friend. There's more money...
CE815CFD     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...in Chinatown than any borough in the city.
C2A68B02     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~The land of opportunity has been good to those people.
DC8F98A9     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Who are you? Chairman of the Liberty City Tourist Board? Anyway, it's been good to me...
3335032D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...and it's going to be even better today.
43F08132     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Get hold of one of those festival costumes and meet me at the back of the Bank of Liberty.
F7B63234     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I'm sure you'll feel at home dressed up like an idiot.
94563271     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~We've made a withdrawal that the bank found somewhat disagreeable.
8964396C     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Terrible customer service. I won't bank here again.
6BBF1666     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Do you have that costume?
A546CB65     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Sure. You've just robbed a bank.
B7AEAF73     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Forget about the getaway car - concentrate on looking like a doofus.
A3E32568     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~And you're the intelligent one?
E1FDA449     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~You have no imagination, Huang. You're like a robot.
C7A03325     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Most of the streets are being blocked for the parade.
FA32CE66     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~We will enjoy the festivities and use the getaway costume.
7D713ACD     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Great! We're all going to jail! Dressed like this!
3651C5C4     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You're a real cock, Zhou! I hope you get raped a lot inside.
487BCB80     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Though you've got a really dysfunctional personality and could do with a good beating...
68E4F37B     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...you have shown some talent today... And for that, I nearly admire you. Thank you.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Ah, my little friend. Isn't it wonderful? While other Triads grow in infamy, I grow in fame.
E40AC0AB     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~While they're wanted by the Feds, I'm pursued only by the press, to whom I'm a civic benefactor.
4CB5B3CB     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~A man of outstanding skill and great spiritual power. A modern hero.
B1E76F95     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~At a time like this, you're courting publicity?
02D47B22     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I didn't ask for the burden of greatness, nor the paparazzi's prying cameras.
0FB436AC     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~But, in the long term, it could be very beneficial...
8403AFB0     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~..especially when it comes to picking up women, not that I need any help, of course.
2AE182FE     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~While I attend to my business, you must see to it that the press get no photos of me.
44122155     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~The public's faith in me must be preserved.
5DE05056     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Wait here, Huang. Chun Chun Fung will be joining us.
0624EBCE     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~He's a very uptight man, and not the swiftest walker...
29B339A4     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Ah, Chun Chun! Climb in my friend. How are your hemorrhoids today?
487854AB     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Huang, let's go.
43461A33     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Chow Chin is meeting us here. He's wanted for arson in 49 states...
861E7B05     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~..or so he claims. I doubt he even knows where half of them are.
F5B38D09     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~So glad you could join us Chow.
B39C9155     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Drive on, Huang.
01E94849     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Huang, we must decide who are to be the powerful Triad headmen once I'm the new boss...
AC720A36     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...so it's time you left, and let us get on with our discussion. Run along.
1A2A27EB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Patronizing dick.
3A8DC503     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~I'm sorry, baby, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings... Let me see... ... um...
BF9CDC0F     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...please, do me a little favor, and get the fuck out of here. Thank you.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~The morons I employ as charity to their families...
24A8C574     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...have allowed a shipment of my goods to be destroyed in the bay.
7E6F873F     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...You must rectify their error, while I attend to other, more vital, matters.
B8F474E7     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Ah... It's a cruel fate that endows me with such potential for greatness...
74D6982D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...but surrounds me with what I assume must be the genetic dregs...
7CECC159     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...of some social experiment gone horribly wrong.
0CA2C53A     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Please don't fuck this up, rich kid.
A283C6A5     //  ~#FF09~Goon~#FF00~~n~Hey, Zhou doesn't like anyone sticking their nose into his business.
2C740183     //  ~#FF09~Goon~#FF00~~n~It's time you ran along. I'll take it from here.~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~The Koreans have had to relinquish their protection racket in Castle Gardens, thanks to your repeated attacks on them.
0C7A74B7     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Why did you do this?
0C87E473     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~I had my reasons.
C33457C7     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Oh, yes - 'revenge' - you're an idiot.
68E4715C     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~We used to get a slice of that deal,
47A08B8D     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...but now some Irish thugs have taken over, we get fuck all.
52B936FB     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~...Well, I'm sorry about your bottom line, tough guy.
967C0FFC     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Don't be! With your idiocy, you've accidentally created a wonderful opportunity...
1B675E85     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...to show the businessmen that the Irish 'insurance' they just bought doesn't protect them against ...
BDD10DA5     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~...fire damage.
3215136C     //  ~#FF00~These are the building supplies that Zhou wants to go up in flames.~#FF09~Guard~#FF00~~n~It's Huang!

058CBD2C     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~You arrogant treacherous shit!
10AEFC87     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Why the hell would I betray the Triads? I was going to be the boss.
65833AA1     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~The FIB file names you and Chan as their contacts.
A2783226     //  ~#FF09~Zhou~#FF00~~n~Bullshit! You're being played, rich kid ... Don't make me kill you.
5AAD42A5     //  ~#FF0C~Huang~#FF00~~n~Whatever you say, Zhou.

3224FA47     //  Nephew,~n~ Unbelievable! Hsin is now engaged in peace talks with certain Italian irritants. There's even talk of us 'working' together. Do I look like I like pizza?

I love him!~n~ He has punished me by giving some of my holdings and businesses to Chan and Zhou. It would make me want to kill and maim and scream in rage less if I didn't KNOW that one of those cunts set me up. But we must find proof before we act. And act I will. I can be very vengeful.

At least, that's how it seemed.~n~~n~Anyway, whoever they were, they stole my father's stupid sword - and left me for dead.~n~~n~Uncle Kenny's in deep shit because of this. I'd better get the damn thing back, or I'll never hear the end of it.~n~
D5D8B135     //  Had some fun with Ling: fooling around with guns, showing off my moves.~n~~n~Some local punks tried muscling in on Uncle Kenny's turf, so we went to teach them a lesson.~n~~n~Things got serious ... I'll miss Ling.~n~
6E0B6BC3     //  Land of the free, my ass. This place is gonna be land of the freebasing just as soon as I find more dealer contacts.~n~~n~This town is so full of crackheads, deadbeats, and junkies that I'm gonna be flying home on my own jet - maybe even my own airline.~n~~n~Still, this city's security cameras are a bitch - maybe I should do something about them. Like I said, land of the free, my ass.~n~
04357F24     //  Uncle Kenny had trouble from some store owners who pay him protection.~n~~n~I had to make an example of one of their stores.~n~~n~Harsh? Maybe, but the store's bound to have regular insurance, so now the owner can clean up too.~n~~n~Who'd have thought it? I'm actually a public benefactor, when all along I've thought I was just a hired thug.~n~
2364B606     //  Thought a rich buyer was trying to get Yu Jian out of the city, but he was clean.~n~~n~Still ... discovered that ripping off vans can be a lucrative side job.~n~
4CD93676     //  Recruited a few new goons for Uncle Kenny.~n~~n~I even tattooed one of them, well, more like scarred him for life. Maybe I should go back and practice.~n~~n~It's not that I think tattooing is going to be a skill that'll come in handy, it's just a lot of fun scarring simpletons.~n~
4896CCD8     //  We took the fight to those moron Spanish Lords, and raided their main storehouse.~n~~n~I'd hoped we'd find Yu Jian, but there was no sign of it.~n~~n~I should keep raiding that warehouse - not that I hold out any hopes that my father's sword will turn up - it's just for shits, giggles and the money.~n~
E0D84049     //  The Spanish Lords have been putting Uncle Kenny under pressure.~n~~n~He's sure they stole Yu Jian.~n~~n~They tried hitting some stores under his protection, but I barricaded the street and kicked the snot out of them.~n~
0E971A72     //  The Spanish Lords hit us again. I guess some idiots never learn. Speaking of which...~n~~n~Uncle Kenny's convinced they're behind all the shit that's coming down on him.~n~~n~And maybe they are, but then again maybe they're just pissed off that we keep hitting them.~n~
B87CE5D5     //  Uncle Kenny sent me on a stupid school-boy errand, but, then again, I did meet up with this girl - Ling Shan.~n~~n~She's nice - apart from the crappy attitude. How come every girl I know is permanently premenstrual? Maybe it's me? ...Nah. I'm way too cool.~n~~n~Anyway, got chased by the cops, but managed to shake them off. Tried my chances with Ling, but 'no go'. Like I said, premenstrual. I just need to give it time.~n~
86DBAD24     //  Ling's death kind of hit me harder then my dad's - understandable - I didn't want to fuck my dad.~n~~n~Anyway, Uncle Kenny got my head together and I got payback on the gang that hit his turf ... and Ling.~n~~n~I hope she sleeps easy now. Which is more than I can say for me - I've gotta get laid.~n~
B9C1A999     //  I collected a bunch of cars for the big boss's son, Chan Jaoming.~n~~n~Hopefully, the boss will take it easier on Uncle Kenny now, and maybe Kenny will get off my back too.~n~~n~He might be under a lot of stress, but he gives it out easy enough too.~n~
D465A27E     //  The big boss, Hsin, wanted us to start working with the mob.~n~~n~Uncle Kenny sent me to bring in some of their contraband coming in by the boat.~n~~n~I got in shit with the coast guard, thanks to a piece of crap boat Uncle Kenny provided.~n~
B78E2AC1     //  Hsin ordered a hit on me and Uncle Kenny.~n~~n~His men chased us across the city, but we dodged them and managed to show Hsin the FIB report.~n~~n~Uncle Kenny cleared our names and became the new Big Boss! My inheritance just went through the roof.~n~
DF128E2D     //  Heston's full of shit. Seriously. He's convinced the Midtown Gangsters stole Yu Jian, and he wants to get their attention.~n~~n~He planted drugs in one of their cars, and got me to make sure the cops found it.~n~The sooner this loser forgets about me the better.~n~
DB18D478     //  IAD are breathing down Heston's neck, but not hard enough for my liking.~n~~n~He needs a big collar, fast - or he's screwed. And if I don't help him he'll make sure I'm screwed.~n~~n~So, while he planted a bug in a Korean hideout, I lured them out of the area.~n~
1473632F     //  Heston wants to lure out the Korean gang bangers that stole Yu Jian.~n~~n~I followed the Korean we set up, and took down the Underboss he led me to.~n~
8A8EC342     //  I saved Heston's ass. He'd been cornered by the assassins that stole Yu Jian.~n~~n~Unfortunately, I killed the assholes before they could tell us who their boss was. Heston got pissed off about that, so I made out I was 'avenging my father'.~n~~n~It didn't wash. He was right - we've lost any chance of finding Yu Jian and their boss now. I can be such a fuck-up at times.~n~
2D9FAB96     //  More dirty work for Heston's FIB contact.~n~~n~His illegal wiretap signal was jammed, so I had to un-jam it.~n~
AA78DC7C     //  Heston's FIB contact will give us their informant's name if we do some of his dirty work.~n~~n~So, I chased down some contraband being brought in by Zhou's men.~n~~n~If Zhou ever finds out I sank his boat I'm gonna be in deep shit.~n~
7C8062BD     //  IAD stole Heston's car.~n~~n~They knew it was full of evidence that'd ruin him and his squad.~n~~n~I got the car back and destroyed the evidence. Man, I should open a fucking valet service for morons.~n~
6ABB2B6A     //  Heston's dealer was going to sell him out to IAD.~n~~n~I chased him down and removed him, and the evidence he had against Heston.~n~
0CDB224E     //  I chased around the city, hacking into the FIB mainframe to get the file on their rat.~n~~n~Discovered there were in fact two rats: Chan and Zhou!~n~~n~Those bastards were both selling the Triads out for their own gain. Gotta admire their balls, really.~n~
667666D6     //  Kenny was behind everything: all so he could take over the Triads in Liberty City.~n~~n~Though, it was Hsin's prompting that pushed him into it.~n~~n~It's over now ... I think I won ... it just feels like I lost - and I still didn't get laid. This city sucks.~n~
A4FAE9FB     //  n/a
A50DAA0A     //  Met Chan Jaoming, the big boss's son.~n~~n~I think he might have been short changed at the brains checkout.~n~~n~I sabotaged some street-race champ's car, so that it'll crash the next time he races it.~n~
A41BABF9     //  Chan's idea of fair play is, 'anything goes, so long as he wins'.~n~~n~So, he got me to smash all the other drivers off the track at his street race.~n~~n~He wasn't even grateful. Rich prick asshole.~n~
FDEE2252     //  Chan was kidnapped by friends of the race champ whose car he had me sabotage.~n~~n~They tried to torch his car while he was locked in the trunk.~n~~n~But, I managed to save him ... and then he blamed me for everything! Seriously, what an asshole.~n~
4B87CD9D     //  I played bodyguard for Chan on a deal he'd set up.~n~~n~We drove into an ambush and only just managed to scrape out of it.~n~~n~Then I ran into a bent cop called Wade Heston, he wants me to work with him. Just what I didn't need.~n~
582B4E27     //  Chan wanted to celebrate acquiring new territory, by racing me in his new boat.~n~~n~But the Spanish Lords had sabotaged it, wanting to ambush Chan while he was adrift.~n~~n~I managed to fend them off long enough for Chan to escape.~n~
78CF31D4     //  The FIB were set to raid Chan's businesses.~n~~n~I had to race around, getting rid of anything that could have been incriminating.~n~~n~NB: Chan's convinced that Zhou is ratting out the Triads.~n~
8C3183A5     //  Chan didn't trust his freeloading entourage anymore.~n~~n~He got them to meet up and wait for him on Happiness Island.~n~~n~That's one barbecue they'll have wished they'd never been to.~n~
CA3FB764     //  Raided Chan's hideout: That prick had to pay for trying to screw over the Triads.~n~~n~He tried to worm his way out of it, saying he'd been set up. Yeah, right!~n~~n~Blog about dying in agony, you fucking moron.~n~
A4FAE9FB     //  n/a
3C68E3FE     //  I finally got to meet the big boss, Hsin Jaoming.~n~~n~He was pretty pissed that his son was ambushed, and wanted revenge.~n~~n~So, I drove a burning fuel tanker into some asshole's gambling den for him.~n~
E7511BFB     //  Feds are crawling all over Triad operations. We've got a rat!~n~~n~Chan got arrested, but Hsin was more concerned about his dirty money getting out of the country.~n~~n~He got me to get it out of the city before the Feds discovered it.~n~
BFF73AF1     //  Hsin had me remove the heads of the Midtown Gangsters... literally!~n~~n~And for my reward I nearly lost my own head.~n~~n~It was only Uncle Kenny's intervention that saved me ...for now.~n~...I've GOT to find the FIB rat and Yu Jian if I'm going to get out of this alive.~n~
E4828B52     //  Chan made bail.~n~~n~Apparently, one of his own entourage sold him to the FIB, and is their chief witness against him.~n~~n~Hsin got me to impress upon the informer how much we disapproved of his treachery.~n~
9427F754     //  D'Avanzo was screwing with me. Capra wasn't the FIB rat!~n~~n~Those two guys have been fighting each other for years. D'Avanzo was just using me to get to him.~n~~n~Now Hsin's really pissed at me! ...I made D'Avanzo pay for that.~n~
9C738430     //  Zhou's intent on becoming Hsin's replacement.~n~~n~He doesn't want his rival, Chan, having access to someone talented like me.~n~~n~Even so, I had to prove myself to the dick by stealing crates off a moving truck. Child's play.~n~
9FD7AC41     //  Hsin wanted to discipline some dealers who'd disrespected him, by blowing up their stash cars.~n~~n~But Zhou saw profit in dealing with them another way.~n~~n~So, I defused Hsin's bombs and Zhou stole the cars. Then the prick practically cut me out of the deal!~n~
815739F9     //  Zhou got into deep shit with Hsin over stopping those dealers' stash cars being blown up.~n~~n~Hsin wanted blood, so we headed over to the dealers' turf and hit their gang hard.~n~~n~...Zhou's getting impatient with Hsin. He's not going to wait around to be handed the leadership.~n~
5C52AC4D     //  Zhou's fucking crazy! He had me pick up an ex-colleague of his just so he could cut his heart out.~n~~n~The guy's got issues!~n~
8AAA6126     //  Zhou robbed the Bank of Liberty and escaped using an 'ingenious' disguise.~n~~n~I stole a dragon costume and we used that to mingle with the crowd during the Chinatown celebrations.~n~~n~It worked! I'm not sure who's more stupid - Zhou or the crowd.~n~
7EE9D5DE     //  Zhou seemed to be the only Triad who hadn't been hit by the FIB.~n~~n~However, the press were showing plenty of interest in him, and were following him around.~n~~n~I made sure they didn't get any photos that could have damaged his good public-image.~n~
0F2037F1     //  I can't believe it!~n~~n~Zhou had me dredge up from the riverbed the same contraband I sent down there when I blew up his boat for Heston.~n~~n~If he only knew the truth!~n~
328C49B1     //  My attacks on the Koreans caused them to lose a protection racket in Castle Gardens.~n~~n~The Irish Killers moved in, but Zhou had me burn them out.~n~~n~I love the smell of baked potato-heads in the morning.~n~
E013AD5F     //  I went after that 'master criminal' Zhou: His treason had to be punished - and I wanted to kick his ass.~n~~n~He thought he could lie his way out of getting what was coming to him.~n~~n~Guess not. It was a long way to the ground, and he screamed all the way.~n~
F5E60BB9     //  Hsin thinks the FIB rat might be in the Angels of Death.~n~~n~He had me contact a private investigator, called Lester, he's using to infiltrate the gang.~n~~n~Lester's a fat waste of space. He needed me to pass the Angels' initiation test for him.~n~
AB134C51     //  Lester was wasted after partying with the Angels.~n~~n~I had to sell the coke they gave him in order to pass their final initiation test.~n~~n~I swear to God: How the fuck did this city get by before I turned up?~n~
D36A151D     //  Lester got down to business with the gang boss's girl, while I kept away any Angels who'd become suspicious of him.~n~~n~Eventually, he got the info we needed from her - there's no FIB rat in their gang.~n~~n~...But what I really wanna know is, how come a fat, useless moron can get laid, while I was getting nothing?
99360F28     //  Lester was accepted into the gang. Those dead beats must've been brain dead.~n~~n~We solved a serious problem the gang had, raising Lester's credibility enough to get close to the gang's boss's girl.~n~~n~He'd be able to find out from her if the gang had an FIB rat in their ranks.~n~
DFF60619     //  After a change of leadership, the Midtown Gangsters moved their main base of operations.~n~~n~Hsin needed to know whether they remained loyal to him, so he had me follow one of their Korean gangbangers to find this 'secret' hideout.~n~
7ED0778F     //  Hsin wanted absolute assurance that the Midtown Gangsters were loyal.~n~~n~He sent me and some of his goons over to their base of operations to look at their files and ledgers.~n~~n~Things got confrontational - and Hsin's goons' explosives didn't help - but at least we got what we went for.~n~
E0D6CD8B     //  The Koreans' ledgers and files detailed a shipment of heavy arms they were about to receive.~n~~n~Hsin wanted to make sure they never got them.~n~
5A5FFBCB     //  Hsin knew the Koreans' weren't a threat to him anymore.~n~~n~But, for daring to consider independence from the Triads, he wanted me to teach them a lesson.~n~~n~Keeping Hsin happy should keep him off my back about Yu Jian... hopefully, he'll get alzheimer's and forget all about the stupid fucking thing.~n~
E0C6B72B     //  A mobster called Rudy D'Avanzo contacted me out of the blue.~n~~n~He said the FIB rat is another mobster called Jimmy Capra, a guy who's become real friendly with Hsin recently.~n~~n~He might be right - Capra's men found us and tried to kill us.~n~
6EBB5FE0     //  I needed evidence on Capra before approaching Hsin about him.~n~~n~Fortunately, D'Avanzo had managed to hide a digital recorder in Capra's car, probably full of all the evidence I'd need.~n~~n~I just had to collect the car to get the recorder back.~n~
70CAACC8     //  D'Avanzo had a 'peace-talks' meeting with Capra. He took me along to make sure Capra found the peace Rudy had in mind for him.~n~~n~Unfortunately, Capra planned something similar for Rudy.~n~~n~You just can't trust anyone these days. It's a disgrace.~n~
4CF5A6B1     //  Hsin got pissed at me for working with D'Avanzo. Capra must be pressuring him.~n~~n~I really needed the recorded evidence I took from Capra's car.~n~~n~D'Avanzo's going to get it to me, but first wanted me to whack some guys named on it.~n~
C39F3BC9     //  Met Xin, a kid who might just be a bigger snot than me.~n~~n~He had some job planned that, he says, will make me a lot of cash, but I didn't see any - just lots of cops - chasing me all over the city.~n~~n~I can't blame them, I was mashing the place up in a tank at the time.~n~
A1CC098F     //  Xin pulled off his big shot job, but he got himself shot in the process.~n~~n~I had all kinds of fun trying to lose the law and get him out of there - underwear day at the launderette is gonna be even more fun now.~n~~n~The kid was delirious, turned out he was Ling's brother, and he figured on killing me to avenge her.~n~~n~Stupid kid lost too much blood... there was nothing I could do but watch him die.~n~

A0542618     //  ~#FF09~Alonso~#FF00~~n~I will reward thee handsomely. With gold and treasure!
