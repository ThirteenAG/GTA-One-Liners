97252CFD     //  Nephew, I'm sorry our meeting was a little tense. I miss your father dearly. He was like a brother to me. In fact, he was a brother to me. My grief often gets the better of me, and I find myself acting inappropriately. Please forgive me. I hope you like your apartment, but don't get too comfortable - I need to speak to you about something as soon as possible.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
07557351     //  Nephew, That restaurant manager has just been complaining about the quality of service we provide. As he is a man who likes to piss into his customers' drinks, I found his choice of words a little confusing. Nonetheless, we cannot tolerate this kind of humiliation.  Come right over!  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
53B82753     //  Nephew, I hope you're enjoying yourself, bleeding me dry in that apartment I am paying for. I myself am experiencing rather dire cash flow problems. I need your help. Please visit me as soon as you can.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
D77ABB87     //  Nephew, You have shown yourself to be a formidable entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical and healthcare business. Your father would be proud.  Keep it up. I've got my eye on a property in East Island City, and I'll need you to raise $5000 so we can secure the lease on it. We're going places, Huang! I'm proud of you.  Your loving uncle, Kenny.
060245E8     //  Nephew, How are you? I'm struggling. Your aunt is giving me hell. She accuses me of being a power crazed, sex maniac. She understands so little about men. Anyway, I'm closing the deal on that property in East Island City. Have you raised the money we need? Bring the $5000 to the warehouse as soon as you can.  Best, Uncle Kenny.
21CED475     //  Nephew, Well done Huang! You have dealt our true enemy a crippling blow. For the first time, I was truly proud to call you my nephew. Previously, I have just said I was proud, but really been sort of embarrassed by you, but not today!  Yours, Uncle Kenny.  PS: I don't think you recovered Yu Jian in this raid, clearly further raids will be necessary.
5FC899CE     //  Nephew, Those Korean kids, the Midtown Gangsters, have been friends of our family for years. Your incessant attacks on them must stop. They're now so weak that they are being threatened and defeated by several of the city's more unpleasant Italian families. For now, we must concentrate our efforts on our most virulent enemies: those moronic Spanish Lords.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
3224FA47     //  Nephew, Unbelievable! Hsin is now engaged in peace talks with certain Italian irritants. There's even talk of us 'working' together. Do I look like I like pizza? And yes, that is a racial stereotype, and no, I don't give a fuck. I'm pissed off. These are the same mobsters that are mopping up territory with Zhou and Chan that was left vacant by your crippling and frankly bizarre assaults on those Koreans. What the fuck were you thinking? Who had got it into your tiny mind that this was a good idea?  Uncle Kenny.
C380B1A2     //  Nephew, Your work with those Italian assholes has pleased Hsin. However, he is less than pleased that we haven't yet recovered Yu Jian. Quite a demanding old goat, isn't he? I love him! He has punished me by giving some of my holdings and businesses to Chan and Zhou. It would make me want to kill and maim and scream in rage less if I didn't KNOW that one of those cunts set me up. But we must find proof before we act. And act I will. I can be very vengeful. I often torture my pets. My wife hates me. The destiny of our family is in your hands, Nephew. Don't be like your dad - don't fuck this up.  Uncle Kenny.  PS: In order to keep a better eye on Chan and Zhou, I have a small place in Lower Easton you are welcome to use.
43AA7DDC     //  Nephew, Hsin's patience with you has seemingly run out. As far as he's concerned you ARE the Fed rat. His men are under orders to kill you on sight. It doesn't look good.  Meet me at the Libertonian Museum. I have a plan. And don't say I haven't got your back.  Uncle Kenny.
5DABE2E6     //  Huang, I have restored your honorable standing: There will be no more lingering doubts over your loyalty.  Though all the Tongs are behind us, finishing off the traitorous Chan and Zhou will be no easy task, as both of them have groups of allies. Probably best we do the honorable thing and kill all of them.  Good Luck. Boss Wu Lee.
2226B7DC     //  Nephew, This is urgent! I will use a lot of exclamation marks in the hope you get my point!!! The Feds are conducting raids on all of our operations. It's an unbelievable liberty!  They seem to know our every move before we make it. Even Chan Jaoming has been arrested! Thank god. I hope someone gives him a good jailhouse welcome. Little prick.  Someone MUST be ratting us all out.  Go to Hsin's penthouse in Little Italy. He'll know what to do.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.  PS: I don't suppose you uncovered any leads about Yu Jian through Zhou or Chan yet? Come on, I need that thing badly.
ACC95F05     //  Nephew, Hsin wants to meet you at the Amusement Park after you've completed your mission. Be careful: He's eliminating all those he suspects of treachery, and he's an angry and hypocritical old goat.  I will try to be there before you arrive.  Uncle Kenny.
B207E6F6     //  Huang, It is as I suspected. The traitor Chan is about to flee his rat-hole, and leave the city. This cannot be allowed to happen. He must pay for his crimes.  The Tongs remember Hsin's oath: The traitor's life was forfeit, no matter whom he was found to be.  I will send some men to aid you. A trapped rat can be dangerous.  Boss Wu Lee.
9E612CF3     //  Nephew, While Hsin has you running errands for the mob, it might be worth your while using one our old safe houses near Spanish Lords territory in Northwood.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
DAE0283F     //  Nephew, I hope you're relaxing and enjoying yourself in this fine city. I'm sick with worry for the future of my family, but I don't mean to worry you. It appears that the rich fool you hijacked used to own an apartment in Lancaster. I found the keys in his van. With him now out of business, perhaps you should make use of it? I am really feeling the expense of putting you up in that first place, and you've not been exactly forward with the rent, have you?  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
415F3960     //  Ah, Huang Lee. Champagne? Cocaine? Attractive trans-sexual prostitute?
414DEAA0     //  We can toast my becoming the next Triad boss.
DC74879C     //  No thanks ... So, has your father actually made you the new boss?
2C371C67     //  Not yet, but my father's approval is guaranteed.
F917FAFA     //  After years of putting me down and calling me a moron...
4B724280     //  ...he's finally realized I'm the best man for the job.
7A1A1485     //  I only need the support of the Tongs to smooth my passage.
10D86691     //  ...I'm sure you do.
390F6152     //  Currently they favor Zhou Ming...
6738C9E0     //  ...but he's more of a street thug than a true leader.
BFB22B99     //  Yes, he's intelligent and charming, but I've got leadership in my genes.
2473493B     //  I'm sure you've got a lot of things in your genes.
2D50BE47     //  Definitely!
C13EB483     //  I can show the Tongs I'm twice the man Zhou is by winning the city's biggest street race.
47A0FF33     //  Oh, that'll win them over. Nothing says leadership like joy riding.
2901F9D1     //  I know! It's a fantastic plan.
6A74E9BB     //  The problem is - the current street race champion is a rotten cheat.
2C40D9F4     //  If I'm going to win fairly we need to make a few subtle modifications to his car.
CB290EAF     //  There's the street race champion.
7C4ACDFD     //  Huang, Meredith, the boss's girl I told you about, is giving me plenty of attention - but she hasn't mentioned a rat yet.

1573EAB3     //  Huang, I got everything I could from Meredith - in fact, more than I bargained for. Hep C, scabies, a deep seated sense of insecurity and the truth about the Angels of Death. Suffice to say, there's no Fed informer in the gang: they're clean, which is more than I can say for Meredith.  I enjoyed working with you Huang. You're a good kid. If ever you need an old sea dog to go on adventures with and tell you about the world in an unlikely but heart warming buddy flick kind of way, I'm your man. Now get out of here before I shed a manly tear.  Lester  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Need a Private Investigator? Call 555-80085 and ease that suspicious mind.
DBF4DB5B     //  Huang, All that shooting is making Meredith nervous. She's stoned but says it's ruining her high. She's also really annoying me and definitely gave me some exotic form of the clap. I'm peeing blue. It sounds like world war three out there, man. Please. Calm it down.  I'm gonna move us some place else. Keep those biker fools off our tails.  Lester  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Need a Private Investigator? Call 555-80085 and ease that suspicious mind.
57A4537A     //  Huang, We did it, baby! I'm in the gang! I've been asking some real probing questions about a possible Fed rat in the gang. Probing, but subtle of course. Don't worry, no one suspects a thing. Yesterday, we did the train on this chick. I joined in, purely for professional reasons. Then we shot up speed. I had a paranoid incident, but I think I covered my tracks. Come meet me at the drug store in East Island City. I've got a plan.  Lester  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Need a Private Investigator?

Hsin said you'd most likely get hold of these for me from Russian dealers in Hove Beach.  I'll be at the Burger Shot in Beechwood City. Don't forget to bring the merchandise.

To truly rekindle your family's fortunes you should be working for me, not that fool Chan.  Meet me at my nightclub in East Island City. Bring 20 bags of weed as a down payment on your future - you'll get good prices from the Yardies in Schottler.  Zhou Ming.
31B2920A     //  Great news Huang! You managed to save enough stash cars for us to make a tidy sum today. As any fool would have anticipated, Hsin has expressed some displeasure with us meddling with his plans. Fear not - I'm very capable. I feigned ignorance and cut him into the profits. (Naturally, this only impacted your slice of the take, as it was my idea and ideas don't grow on trees).  You can thank me later.  Zhou Ming.
30FA3815     //  Huang, After all I've done for Hsin he still fails to favor me as his replacement. His wisdom must be receding faster than his hairline. We must do something about this - his idiocy not his hair - I cannot perform miracles, yet. I tried walking on water the other day - one day...  See you soon. Zhou Ming.
AA18E171     //  Huang, Join me at my Lower Easton residence, to continue your studies in the art of victory. Seriously, I've got a golden opportunity for us. Zhou.
3A372E35     //  Huang, I hear that the moron Chan has already been released on bail. Strangely quick don't you think? I bet the pig squealed.  He should rot behind bars. It would be safer for all of us had he been properly organized and not wrecked on drugs, he wouldn't have been arrested in the first place.  If he's made boss, we're all screwed. Huang, don't be a fuck up. I know I can be a bit full on, but I understand this town.  Visit me soon. Zhou.
22B17E0D     //  Huang, I know I was a little abrupt, but I wanted to protect you - the less you know about my business, the less chance you have of being kidnapped and tortured. So, sorry, but that's just the way things are. Anyway, assuming you're not sulking like a spoilt rich kid who doesn't understand that the world doesn't owe him a living, I've got some work for you. Oh, wait, you are a...  Anyway, meet me at my warehouse in Fishmarket North, and let's see if my tutelage has produced any results.  Zhou.

E65CCE1B     //  Huang, That the Korean Midtown Gangsters haven't put some heavy killers on you tells me we're probably shooting wide of the mark. I've got a feeling their gang may have some issues within it. I've been doing some digging but we need to get more reliable info.  Come and see me.  Heston.
FA75B118     //  Huang, Planting the bug was supposed to have been the dangerous part of that mission, but I had it easy thanks to your fireworks.  You're one crazy son of a bitch, Huang. I'm starting to like you.  Heston.
B9C0B10E     //  Huang, Framing that Korean gangbanger has severely depleted my personal stash. I need you to get hold of 2 bags of coke and bring them over as soon as possible. I usually get mine off the Angels of Death in Willis. It's purely for recreational purposes, of course. My wife left me. I'm kind of a tragic figure. They should make a movie about me: A sad, corrupt cop with a drug problem. I'm one of a kind!  Heston.
0D84CAE4     //  Huang, I was right. There is a bunch of assassins operating as a small secretive group inside the main gang. They call themselves the Wonsu Nodong. They're pretty serious operators. I'm pretty sure they know someone is on to them.  Come and see me.  Heston.

DA0CEC64     //  Huang, It's not what you know, it's who you know: My contact in the FIB is gonna give us the name of the rat who's selling out the Triads. All he wants in return is help on a couple of legally 'sensitive' jobs.  See you at the gas station in Lancaster.  Heston.
0198509E     //  Huang, When you've finished taking out that boat, get over to Colony Island. Zhou's guys managed to land some contraband there earlier. My FIB contact wants all of that shit gone, so you'd better deal with it.  Thanks man, Heston.

23DA5D46     //  Huang, I hear those dangerous idiots at the FIB have a friendly voice giving them the inside track on your boss, making life awkward for all of you. Looks to me like the Wonsu Boss's plan to 'bring down the Triads' has begun.  Put two and two together, Huang: the Wonsu's Boss and the Feds' rat are the same guy. I've got a lead that's gonna deliver him to us.  Remember, I need this big collar to clear my name with IAD, so we're gonna do this my way.  Come and see me in North Holland. Let's get back in business.  Heston.
F15F1BC2     //  Huang, IAD has scared off my Fed contact. Don't worry, we can still get the rat's name.  Come and see me. I'm in Purgatory ... literally!  Heston.

552217DB     //  Huang, IAD are closing in on me, so I'll keep this short: Chan and Zhou weren't rats! My Fed contact gave us a phony file. The bastard's been working for the real Wonsu Boss - and rat - all along.  They're gonna meet up on Charge Island soon. I could sure use you as back up. What do you say?  Meet me at the Municipal Pool in Dukes.  Heston.

Chan told me he's got a new drug that needs road testing, so I volunteered you. Don't worry. You won't be taking it, just helping with 'marketing.'

My grief often gets the better of me, and I find myself acting inappropriately. Please forgive me. I hope you like your apartment, but don't get too comfortable - I need to speak to you about something as soon as possible.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
07557351     //  Nephew, That restaurant manager has just been complaining about the quality of service we provide. As he is a man who likes to piss into his customers' drinks, I found his choice of words a little confusing. Nonetheless, we cannot tolerate this kind of humiliation.  Come right over!  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
53B82753     //  Nephew, I hope you're enjoying yourself, bleeding me dry in that apartment I am paying for. I myself am experiencing rather dire cash flow problems. I need your help. Please visit me as soon as you can.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
D77ABB87     //  Nephew, You have shown yourself to be a formidable entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical and healthcare business. Your father would be proud.  Keep it up. I've got my eye on a property in East Island City, and I'll need you to raise $5000 so we can secure the lease on it. We're going places, Huang! I'm proud of you.  Your loving uncle, Kenny.
060245E8     //  Nephew, How are you? I'm struggling. Your aunt is giving me hell. She accuses me of being a power crazed, sex maniac. She understands so little about men. Anyway, I'm closing the deal on that property in East Island City. Have you raised the money we need? Bring the $5000 to the warehouse as soon as you can.  Best, Uncle Kenny.
21CED475     //  Nephew, Well done Huang! You have dealt our true enemy a crippling blow. For the first time, I was truly proud to call you my nephew. Previously, I have just said I was proud, but really been sort of embarrassed by you, but not today!  Yours, Uncle Kenny.  PS: I don't think you recovered Yu Jian in this raid, clearly further raids will be necessary.
5FC899CE     //  Nephew, Those Korean kids, the Midtown Gangsters, have been friends of our family for years. Your incessant attacks on them must stop. They're now so weak that they are being threatened and defeated by several of the city's more unpleasant Italian families. For now, we must concentrate our efforts on our most virulent enemies: those moronic Spanish Lords.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
3224FA47     //  Nephew, Unbelievable! Hsin is now engaged in peace talks with certain Italian irritants. There's even talk of us 'working' together. Do I look like I like pizza? And yes, that is a racial stereotype, and no, I don't give a fuck. I'm pissed off. These are the same mobsters that are mopping up territory with Zhou and Chan that was left vacant by your crippling and frankly bizarre assaults on those Koreans. What the fuck were you thinking? Who had got it into your tiny mind that this was a good idea?  Uncle Kenny.
C380B1A2     //  Nephew, Your work with those Italian assholes has pleased Hsin. However, he is less than pleased that we haven't yet recovered Yu Jian. Quite a demanding old goat, isn't he? I love him! He has punished me by giving some of my holdings and businesses to Chan and Zhou. It would make me want to kill and maim and scream in rage less if I didn't KNOW that one of those cunts set me up. But we must find proof before we act. And act I will. I can be very vengeful. I often torture my pets. My wife hates me. The destiny of our family is in your hands, Nephew. Don't be like your dad - don't fuck this up.  Uncle Kenny.  PS: In order to keep a better eye on Chan and Zhou, I have a small place in Lower Easton you are welcome to use.
43AA7DDC     //  Nephew, Hsin's patience with you has seemingly run out. As far as he's concerned you ARE the Fed rat. His men are under orders to kill you on sight. It doesn't look good.  Meet me at the Libertonian Museum. I have a plan. And don't say I haven't got your back.  Uncle Kenny.
5DABE2E6     //  Huang, I have restored your honorable standing: There will be no more lingering doubts over your loyalty.  Though all the Tongs are behind us, finishing off the traitorous Chan and Zhou will be no easy task, as both of them have groups of allies. Probably best we do the honorable thing and kill all of them.  Good Luck. Boss Wu Lee.
2226B7DC     //  Nephew, This is urgent! I will use a lot of exclamation marks in the hope you get my point!!! The Feds are conducting raids on all of our operations. It's an unbelievable liberty!  They seem to know our every move before we make it. Even Chan Jaoming has been arrested! Thank god. I hope someone gives him a good jailhouse welcome. Little prick.  Someone MUST be ratting us all out.  Go to Hsin's penthouse in Little Italy. He'll know what to do.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.

ACC95F05     //  Nephew, Hsin wants to meet you at the Amusement Park after you've completed your mission. Be careful: He's eliminating all those he suspects of treachery, and he's an angry and hypocritical old goat.  I will try to be there before you arrive.  Uncle Kenny.
B207E6F6     //  Huang, It is as I suspected. The traitor Chan is about to flee his rat-hole, and leave the city. This cannot be allowed to happen. He must pay for his crimes.  The Tongs remember Hsin's oath: The traitor's life was forfeit, no matter whom he was found to be.  I will send some men to aid you. A trapped rat can be dangerous.  Boss Wu Lee.
9E612CF3     //  Nephew, While Hsin has you running errands for the mob, it might be worth your while using one our old safe houses near Spanish Lords territory in Northwood.  Yours, Uncle Kenny.
DAE0283F     //  Nephew, I hope you're relaxing and enjoying yourself in this fine city. I'm sick with worry for the future of my family, but I don't mean to worry you. It appears that the rich fool you hijacked used to own an apartment in Lancaster. I found the keys in his van. With him now out of business, perhaps you should make use of it? I am really feeling the expense of putting you up in that first place, and you've not been exactly forward with the rent, have you?  Yours, Uncle Kenny.

1573EAB3     //  Huang, I got everything I could from Meredith - in fact, more than I bargained for. Hep C, scabies, a deep seated sense of insecurity and the truth about the Angels of Death. Suffice to say, there's no Fed informer in the gang: they're clean, which is more than I can say for Meredith.  I enjoyed working with you Huang. You're a good kid. If ever you need an old sea dog to go on adventures with and tell you about the world in an unlikely but heart warming buddy flick kind of way, I'm your man.

Don't worry, no one suspects a thing. Yesterday, we did the train on this chick. I joined in, purely for professional reasons. Then we shot up speed. I had a paranoid incident, but I think I covered my tracks. Come meet me at the drug store in East Island City. I've got a plan.  Lester  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Need a Private Investigator?

Like I said, land of the free, my ass.
04357F24     //  Uncle Kenny had trouble from some store owners who pay him protection.I had to make an example of one of their stores.Harsh? Maybe, but the store's bound to have regular insurance, so now the owner can clean up too.Who'd have thought it? I'm actually a public benefactor, when all along I've thought I was just a hired thug.

B87CE5D5     //  Uncle Kenny sent me on a stupid school-boy errand, but, then again, I did meet up with this girl - Ling Shan.She's nice - apart from the crappy attitude. How come every girl I know is permanently premenstrual? Maybe it's me? ...Nah. I'm way too cool.Anyway, got chased by the cops, but managed to shake them off. Tried my chances with Ling, but 'no go'. Like I said, premenstrual. I just need to give it time.
86DBAD24     //  Ling's death kind of hit me harder then my dad's - understandable - I didn't want to fuck my dad.Anyway, Uncle Kenny got my head together and I got payback on the gang that hit his turf ... and Ling.I hope she sleeps easy now.

8A8EC342     //  I saved Heston's ass. He'd been cornered by the assassins that stole Yu Jian.Unfortunately, I killed the assholes before they could tell us who their boss was.

FDEE2252     //  Chan was kidnapped by friends of the race champ whose car he had me sabotage.They tried to torch his car while he was locked in the trunk.But, I managed to save him ... and then he blamed me for everything! Seriously, what an asshole.
4B87CD9D     //  I played bodyguard for Chan on a deal he'd set up.We drove into an ambush and only just managed to scrape out of it.Then I ran into a bent cop called Wade Heston, he wants me to work with him. Just what I didn't need.
350CB427     //  Chan had me collect a TV broadcast van for a reporter friend of his, Melanie Mallard.He's convinced that the tongs will be impressed that he's the 'big boss' in a crummy fly-on-the-wall documentary about dealers she's making.This is so gonna end in tears.
97E7238C     //  Surprise. Surprise. Mel double crossed Chan, hoping to air the tapes she'd made about his gang, and reveal everyone's identity on TV.I was against it from the outset, but who listens to me? I just get to fix Chan's problems.Maybe I should be the boss? ...I guess he did the right thing in the end.
582B4E27     //  Chan wanted to celebrate acquiring new territory, by racing me in his new boat.But the Spanish Lords had sabotaged it, wanting to ambush Chan while he was adrift.I managed to fend them off long enough for Chan to escape.
78CF31D4     //  The FIB were set to raid Chan's businesses.I had to race around, getting rid of anything that could have been incriminating.NB: Chan's convinced that Zhou is ratting out the Triads.

BFF73AF1     //  Hsin had me remove the heads of the Midtown Gangsters... literally!And for my reward I nearly lost my own head.It was only Uncle Kenny's intervention that saved me ...for now....I've GOT to find the FIB rat and Yu Jian if I'm going to get out of this alive.
E4828B52     //  Chan made bail.Apparently, one of his own entourage sold him to the FIB, and is their chief witness against him.Hsin got me to impress upon the informer how much we disapproved of his treachery.
9427F754     //  D'Avanzo was screwing with me. Capra wasn't the FIB rat!Those two guys have been fighting each other for years. D'Avanzo was just using me to get to him.Now Hsin's really pissed at me! ...I made D'Avanzo pay for that.
9C738430     //  Zhou's intent on becoming Hsin's replacement.He doesn't want his rival, Chan, having access to someone talented like me.Even so, I had to prove myself to the dick by stealing crates off a moving truck. Child's play.

815739F9     //  Zhou got into deep shit with Hsin over stopping those dealers' stash cars being blown up.Hsin wanted blood, so we headed over to the dealers' turf and hit their gang hard....Zhou's getting impatient with Hsin. He's not going to wait around to be handed the leadership.
5C52AC4D     //  Zhou's fucking crazy! He had me pick up an ex-colleague of his just so he could cut his heart out.The guy's got issues!
8AAA6126     //  Zhou robbed the Bank of Liberty and escaped using an 'ingenious' disguise.I stole a dragon costume and we used that to mingle with the crowd during the Chinatown celebrations.It worked! I'm not sure who's more stupid - Zhou or the crowd.
7EE9D5DE     //  Zhou seemed to be the only Triad who hadn't been hit by the FIB.However, the press were showing plenty of interest in him, and were following him around.I made sure they didn't get any photos that could have damaged his good public-image.
0F2037F1     //  I can't believe it!Zhou had me dredge up from the riverbed the same contraband I sent down there when I blew up his boat for Heston.If he only knew the truth!
328C49B1     //  My attacks on the Koreans caused them to lose a protection racket in Castle Gardens.The Irish Killers moved in, but Zhou had me burn them out.I love the smell of baked potato-heads in the morning.
E013AD5F     //  I went after that 'master criminal' Zhou: His treason had to be punished - and I wanted to kick his ass.He thought he could lie his way out of getting what was coming to him.Guess not. It was a long way to the ground, and he screamed all the way.
F5E60BB9     //  Hsin thinks the FIB rat might be in the Angels of Death.He had me contact a private investigator, called Lester, he's using to infiltrate the gang.Lester's a fat waste of space. He needed me to pass the Angels' initiation test for him.
AB134C51     //  Lester was wasted after partying with the Angels.I had to sell the coke they gave him in order to pass their final initiation test.I swear to God: How the fuck did this city get by before I turned up?
D36A151D     //  Lester got down to business with the gang boss's girl, while I kept away any Angels who'd become suspicious of him.Eventually, he got the info we needed from her - there's no FIB rat in their gang....But what I really wanna know is, how come a fat, useless moron can get laid, while I was getting nothing?
99360F28     //  Lester was accepted into the gang. Those dead beats must've been brain dead.We solved a serious problem the gang had, raising Lester's credibility enough to get close to the gang's boss's girl.He'd be able to find out from her if the gang had an FIB rat in their ranks.
DFF60619     //  After a change of leadership, the Midtown Gangsters moved their main base of operations.Hsin needed to know whether they remained loyal to him, so he had me follow one of their Korean gangbangers to find this 'secret' hideout.
7ED0778F     //  Hsin wanted absolute assurance that the Midtown Gangsters were loyal.He sent me and some of his goons over to their base of operations to look at their files and ledgers.Things got confrontational - and Hsin's goons' explosives didn't help - but at least we got what we went for.
E0D6CD8B     //  The Koreans' ledgers and files detailed a shipment of heavy arms they were about to receive.Hsin wanted to make sure they never got them.
5A5FFBCB     //  Hsin knew the Koreans' weren't a threat to him anymore.But, for daring to consider independence from the Triads, he wanted me to teach them a lesson.Keeping Hsin happy should keep him off my back about Yu Jian... hopefully, he'll get alzheimer's and forget all about the stupid fucking thing.
E0C6B72B     //  A mobster called Rudy D'Avanzo contacted me out of the blue.He said the FIB rat is another mobster called Jimmy Capra, a guy who's become real friendly with Hsin recently.He might be right - Capra's men found us and tried to kill us.
6EBB5FE0     //  I needed evidence on Capra before approaching Hsin about him.Fortunately, D'Avanzo had managed to hide a digital recorder in Capra's car, probably full of all the evidence I'd need.I just had to collect the car to get the recorder back.
70CAACC8     //  D'Avanzo had a 'peace-talks' meeting with Capra. He took me along to make sure Capra found the peace Rudy had in mind for him.Unfortunately, Capra planned something similar for Rudy.You just can't trust anyone these days. It's a disgrace.
4CF5A6B1     //  Hsin got pissed at me for working with D'Avanzo. Capra must be pressuring him.I really needed the recorded evidence I took from Capra's car.D'Avanzo's going to get it to me, but first wanted me to whack some guys named on it.
C39F3BC9     //  Met Xin, a kid who might just be a bigger snot than me.He had some job planned that, he says, will make me a lot of cash, but I didn't see any - just lots of cops - chasing me all over the city.I can't blame them, I was mashing the place up in a tank at the time.
A1CC098F     //  Xin pulled off his big shot job, but he got himself shot in the process.I had all kinds of fun trying to lose the law and get him out of there - underwear day at the launderette is gonna be even more fun now.The kid was delirious, turned out he was Ling's brother, and he figured on killing me to avenge her.Stupid kid lost too much blood... there was nothing I could do but watch him die.
E3813F78     //  Mel needed to film a shipment of drugs entering the country, so I took her to the docks.Things were going fine until we were ambushed, which only made that crazy bitch hot to film the whole thing.I don't go looking for the crazies, but they always seem to find me.
5E45AEC7     //  Mel needed to film a drug factory, so Chan had me show her around a rival's operation.Oddly, they weren't keen on us being there, so I had to persuade them to be nice while Mel got her photo-journalistic gold.
556020F4     //  Chan had a lethal new drug that he wanted 'marketing', so I got to take Mel on a tour of crackwhore central, via bum underpass.The junkies went crazy for it, and the crazies went junky for it.For all Mel's complaining about the 'inhumanity' she didn't stop shooting film.

5A5509B6     //  Huang Lee, Like you, I am a rich and powerful man's son who has always struggled for an identity of their own, but after years of therapy has finally conquered their demons and is on top of the world. I love Kenny, but let's be quite frank, he's finished as a serious contender in this town. The race to replace Hsin, and become the new Triad boss, is between me and Zhou Ming now - and I'm Hsin's son - so it shouldn't take a genius to figure out who'll win! I'm wise, intelligent and the kind of man who sensibly confides in strangers, so I will make an excellent boss as I'm sure my father realizes. It's lucky for you, I like your moves. Maybe there's a future for you with me. I'll be at my garage in East Island City. Come and see me.  Your future friend and boss, Chan Jaoming.
7DF1CE25     //  Huang, Being kidnapped never brings out the best in me. I was angry when I blamed you, but let's put it behind us - for friendship's sake. My therapist told me to apologize, so I will: I'm sorry. I'll be at my penthouse in East Holland. See you there? We can hang out and have fun and play beach volleyball together and make a montage video and set it to music and stuff, just like in the movies. I always do this with my friends, which may be why I haven't got many, because I always look better than them in the video. Yours, Chan Jaoming.  PS: I need your help pulling off a big drug deal.
B43F9996     //  Huang, I've told my father all about you. He's looking forward to meeting you.  It's best not to keep him waiting.  See you soon.  Chan.
681FA76A     //  Hey Huang, Now that many of Kenny's businesses are in my hands, you can officially think of me as your boss. But don't think of me as a boss. Think of me as a friend who's just quite a bit more important than you are. Maybe we should have a party to celebrate.  Meet me at the Marina. I'll get some treats in.  Your friend, Chan.
2B246A7A     //  Huang, I need your help. I've already told my father that I've dealt with this matter personally, so you can't let me down! I'll see you at my garage.  Your Boss and best friend, Chan.  PS: Zhou thinks he's pretty cool getting off completely free while the rest of us suffer. That rat's working with the Feds, selling us out so he can take over!
2E379694     //  Huang, I'm sick and tired of waiting to be boss. My father's just holding me back, probably because he' s jealous as I'm so young and beautiful, just like the Greek play, Octopus.  Well, the party's over, Daddy - and I've got 8 legs. I know what I have to do to become the boss now. - marry my mom and stab out my own eyes. No, only joking.  Come and see me. I'll be at Videogeddon. I've got a really clever plan.  Your Boss and BFF, Chan.
68E5DA69     //  Huang, While Mel's making her documentary she's going to need someone to look after her. Her safety is important to me, Huang. We've got this crazy myroomonline relationship. We talk all night. I confide my very soul to her. Then we have e-mail sex, like five or six times a night and send lots of intimate photos. She's got an amazing one of me wearing a ball gag and, well, another time. Anyway, we're like best friends, obviously you're still a great buddy, but with her it's different: we're 'friends' that want more, but neither of us want to spoil that by making a move and actually kissing, so we keep the cyber in cyber sex, if you know what I mean. The tension is quite beautiful. I'd blog about it but she'd only read it, and what we have would be lost forever - then I'd probably have to have her shot. I know she'll be safe with you, Huang, you're good in a fight and, as my ugliest friend, I know she's not going to fall for you. Touch her and you're dead. Pick her up at her place in BOABO. Yours, Chan.
