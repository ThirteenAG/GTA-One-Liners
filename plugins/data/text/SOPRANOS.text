0E134213     //  You thought wrong, bonehead! He's in the office!
151B3684     //  I told you. Go check in with Tone.

E55E5EF7     //  Madonn'! It's a simple fucking order!
526C58A2     //  Did you get Tony's order?
B77FF881     //  Tony, Chris, Silvio, got 'em all.

02562616     //  You didn't hear me before? Get lost.
9C36D1C7     //  Don't just stand there! This ain't happy hour.
39D48FE9     //  Take over. My manicure is fuckin' ruined.
B95FA700     //  What happened?
FE945D91     //  Pound this cocksucker. Or maybe you like seeing your captain disrespected? 
B6538C58     //  Fuck this guy. He's lucky he ain't fuckin' dead.
540BFB22     //  Hey, you never know, you know what I mean?
1D56857C     //  I didn't say nothing!
7F4A8819     //  Saying nothin' ain't good enough.
FCE6B773     //  The guy's a low-life Paulie, no question.
598CEAFD     //  Then earn your pay.
FCB7AD10     //  Bring him here. Let's see if this wall's a mirage. 
EB7779F6     //  Whatever you say, Paulie.
0A1C671A     //  Looks pretty real to me.
FE6BFEA7     //  Enough already. Clean him up.
A262AC48     //  Head first.
EC443520     //  All right, forget that fuck.
0282F4CC     //  Why'd you hit his head so hard?
6CF16B88     //  Hey, we both kicked his ass, Paulie! Remember?
5E7CF126     //  I didn't think he was gonna fuckin' die! Get him out of here.

824AF397     //  Hey, LaRocca. You got people waiting.
4A0B3123     //  Hey Paulie. You ever in the, ah, car business?
508A3E09     //  I've been in every business, my friend.
A2EFD089     //  I heard about this shop in Newark -
85B7B255     //  Motherfucker! Guess who's celebrating his non-marriage to my little girl with a fucking lapdance?
A1C99E05     //  He's rubbing your nose in it, Neil.
220914F8     //  He broke my daughter's heart and cost me a fuckin' fortune!
F8867F4E     //  And you still owe me for the other night.
0228C033     //  I'm bleeding money, Paulie.
CC191BD2     //  Then maybe the groom should pony up some guilt money. Joey, let's go say hello.
D8DF5160     //  If Neil don't cough up what he owes, I'm sending you.
0E7C2735     //  Whenever you want, Paulie.
1355365E     //  Fucking lawyers. Quick to bill, slow to pay.
8703145C     //  The boss wants you... In back.
E387487D     //  So, Tuzzio got shot, fell off the roof, and still survived? Fuckin' miracle of medicine.
0C445FF5     //  Not anymore, it isn't.
04C0E66E     //  When you pulled the plug, what happened?
238FB07D     //  Wasn't pretty.
758257B1     //  Sorry kid. No cards for you 'til Tony gives the word.
33DFD975     //  You'll get there. Just not tonight.
06B8FDC2     //  What's keeping Paulie? He oughta be done with the Philly fanatic by now. 
F233F3FB     //  Debbie show you a little gratitude?
2FE56F3F     //  She didn't have to.
7D27AACC     //  Paulie still out there?
370FAA8F     //  Just left. Taking his ma to get her hair done. 
8025C7A1     //  He told me you were in charge of cleaning up the john the other night.
A221BB6C     //  That's right. Me and Reggie did it. Everything okay?
13A99009     //  Next time use more ammonia.
7A2F8604     //  Blood leaves a metallic smell, needs a strong disinfectant.
4ABCAD8B     //  What's with all the loitering? Paulie ain't occupying your precious time? 
F8B33AB6     //  He had me running around all week!
08BE3637     //  Stay busy kid.
71EED76A     //  You did good work on the john. There's a lot more that needs cleaning around this dump.
C50CEB64     //  Joey. Professor McNally was fillin' me in here on a unique business opportunity. 
4FF69E6A     //  Okay....
4C81A2D8     //  Thought I'd be a silent partner but the prof here thinks it's unethical.

E845032D     //  Then I hope your classroom is wheelchair accessible.
9DB7EF0C     //  My God. You're actually threatening me.
DCFC3DE1     //  It's more like a promise.
AB8FF89F     //  So you're gonna refuse your friend?
47EC2CD6     //  Like I said, it's a question of ethics.
0AEDC160     //  Sharing with your friends. That ain't ethical?
645BBD51     //  Not in this case. 
09B98F02     //  So's jaywalking. But most people do it anyway.
9E8E8E54     //  I'm sorry. But that kind of facile logic just isn't going to work.
4DC4C2D3     //  Whatever the fuck that means.
D294F58F     //  I thought he'd listen to reason. Guess we'll have to move on to violence.
C03F202F     //  What?! 
3B37DAC1     //  Sorry professor. Cough up that name, or you'll be takin' a permanent sabbatical.

9D9B8901     //  Thanks, Sil. I know shit about stocks.

28D29212     //  Fuck him. That those cocksuckers even got near Tony's son... it's unprofessional.
383C99AF     //  Is Tony around? I oughta check in.
78B98BC6     //  He's getting a bite to eat over at Vesuvios.
64ED34AA     //  You got company upstairs, a Dr. Adams.
D724178B     //  Good, an account receivable. Thanks, Sil.
EFBDFE59     //  We just talked. He had a bill to pay.
A5D9B510     //  Go to Vesuvio now?
F0961CAF     //  The guy upstairs. Remember?
7B2CB17B     //  I'm on it.
E6FD1400     //  You're gonna go see Tony, right?
D42A7F46     //  Absolutely. Just had to pick up a car.
62908A38     //  Hey, Tony...You want anything from the deli? Paulie's hungry.
EC15FA7C     //  Which must mean you're buying. Get me the salami on rye, lettuce, mayo, mustard.
4C4F1B7A     //  Eh... chicken soup with rice. Lotsa pickles.
9C368A89     //  Cheeseburger and a vanilla shake.
ABB9F6EA     //  If it's chocolate, you're fuckin' takin' it back, got it?
7B048344     //  Neil?
3DDF18D2     //  No thanks, I'm off to AC, then I'm dropping by the bachelor party.
46A00F17     //  You're gonna spy on your future son-in-law, and then tell your daughter?
50C6EE72     //  He can look, but not touch. Those are the rules. 
2D3E7D5F     //  Hey, you're a defense attorney, counselor, not a prosecutor.
6BFED4E2     //  I feel sorry for the fuckin' kid, marrying into the Perry Mason family.
93516DDE     //  How's Paulie's little meeting going out there?
130B2A30     //  The guy's a fuckin' moron, if you ask me.
CA4AA734     //  Considering his family, not a big surprise. 
82B0BB50     //  The guy called Paulie, you know, stupid.
B15F75E1     //  Ho! And he thinks he's gonna make a fuckin' deal?
6E1BF9DE     //  Looks a little intense. 
CA89030C     //  Fucking Philly cheesesteaks. Every time they gotta whip it out.
ACBC1415     //  Who is he?
8D5035F8     //  Hey, if you needed to know, you'd already know, Junior G-Man.
57EB44B6     //  Sil told me 'bout that drunk outside. Nice work.
FD6F1E83     //  Thanks Uncle T.
67B9B255     //  Hey, I don't care how many times you hung out with Tony's kids. You still ain't a blood relative. 
C219CEA7     //  Chrissy's on the rag. Neil cleaned him out. I'm just picking the bones.
C6290946     //  Did you see Vito yet? He's in the lounge. The man might be hungry.
86908B55     //  I heard you ran into a little trouble at the casino the other night.
110AC9A2     //  Just a couple of assholes from high school. 
E1A8C2E4     //  Yeah, that shit never ends.
42F78F47     //  It was no big deal.
02EE5A69     //  Good, glad to hear it.
C0DFB74F     //  Wasn't my fault, Tone.
9CD899FA     //  Neil's son-in-law is a real piece of work, huh?
F471C408     //  Didn't mean to cause trouble, T.
E374B4C7     //  Uh, guys your age, you need to... sow wild oats, so to speak. Don't worry about it.
CAF5B887     //  Joey. Debbie's dancing for some creep next door.
B8EC1E7C     //  Take a look, would you?
64B47B47     //  Sure thing, Sil.
6060EA55     //  Tony, you need anything?
0A70EEAB     //  Go check out that girl Debbie, like Sil asked. You like her, right?
0DCD9DEA     //  We get along, yeah.
07BF34EE     //  You two ever... 
B7571A9C     //  Debbie? Not that kind. Now Jasmine, she's a different story.
8BADB9D3     //  Careful there. A bit of a revolving door, I hear. 
EAC30D30     //  Fuck! Mikey told me the same thing.
64133E9A     //  Joey! Go! Debbie, now.
CB38D6F3     //  Everything good next door?
A6969E3F     //  It is now.
1AF56EBF     //  Get out there kid. Chrissy's waitin'.
558E4266     //  In the lounge. Go, go!
28E7A8CA     //  You talk to that kicker?
A6B2FD78     //  He won't be kickin' right on Sunday.
89A714FC     //  It's covered, Tone. He's cooperating.
D35745E4     //  So, as I was saying... you're startin' to impress me, kid. 
3FC136C8     //  I've been ridin' his ass, T.
DCB1326C     //  There's a party at Vesuvio's next week. Hesh's nephew's Bar Mitzvah.
A4B93E50     //  Everyone's coming, including you
E16F00B7     //  Hey, Tone, thanks. Should I bring a gift?
C3A302E9     //  Fifty bucks in an envelope. Kids that age, all they want is cash.
59CF4FAF     //  Bring fifty-four. It's a sacred number. Some Jewish ka-blah-blah shit.
2D3BD229     //  Go to the Bar Mitzvah now?
A5C21FB3     //  Uh, excuse me, Tone. You seen Paulie?
95F38F16     //  Try in back.
CFFF8223     //  What now?
7BB9AE8A     //  Excuse me, this is a private conversation.
3AA992B8     //  Closing time already. I'm gonna check the take.
DAAF2343     //  I talked with A.J. after we got home.
DAD237EE     //  He says you saved his life and the whole mess was his, not yours.
CD9F85FD     //  We were in it together. I'm sorry, Tony. I shoulda come right to you. 
8CA85BE8     //  He says he asked you not to, and that you were keeping your word and not rattin' him out. If I wasn't pissed off, I'd be impressed. 
00D13C89     //  I won't fuck up again, Tony, I swear.
D43B8AE4     //  Well, you ain't gonna get the chance for a long time. 
86FB8124     //  You got something to say now?
91B0B453     //  Excuse me, T. It's important.
0F2851A9     //  Jesus Christ, Sil. I'm in a meeting!
DAEB30A8     //  Tony! He's gone.
54675691     //  Guess the meetin's over.
B873E3AC     //  Oh yeah. Angelo just returned your car. 
F61BB0FD     //  You got a big heart, Tone. Putting Big Pussy's bastard kid on the payroll.
AD0C15AE     //  My mother raised me. I didn't have shit to do with my old man.
FDC69228     //  I wasn't talking to you. Was I?
67E8499D     //  Hey, I'm standing right here!
1668047B     //  And you can thank Tony for that. Your old man was a rat, like it or not.
1E4167D7     //  Sorry to tell you kid. Chris ain't wrong.
EBC48049     //  Good point. 
CA90E5BC     //  Then keep your mouth shut. It ain't my fault your old man was a rat.
7E364385     //  Bring it down a notch, will ya?
3E6D9E75     //  I know, but you're talking about me.
B4990D96     //  You're old man was a rat. That's what I know.
A4BB2F6E     //  Let him be, Christopher.
C93C27F1     //  If I want advice, I'll ask someone else.
9BE90CC2     //  Looks like you oughta.
EBC8DC97     //  He's got you there, Chrissy
7CF8B7EE     //  You're supposed to see T, remember?
32923F4A     //  I'm all over it.
C345FAEC     //  You gonna be free later? I might need something.
AC631BCB     //  That's up to Paulie.
D1CE7AE5     //  What a wimp dick.
59BAC757     //  Hey, LaRocca, over here. Chop chop.
1124C50D     //  I gotta go. Thanks, Joey, you're a sweetheart.
CDBDD06C     //  I gotta make a collection. This punk who runs the gym's been holding back. You're coming with me.
1CB15B5E     //  I work for Paulie!
90EF28C4     //  Then he better not find out, right?
78914120     //  This is bullshit, Chris. He's a captain!
069B5E6F     //  And so am I. What are you gonna do? Tell the principal?
B861D809     //  Fuck.
4840CCB3     //  Go to the Gym with Chris now?
CB77DCE1     //  Is Paulie around?
4EA4209A     //  If he knows about Saul, it's coming our of your pocket, jerkoff. 
21AEAFA4     //  I got it. You seen him?
0F155D72     //  What am I, your fuckin' advance man?
6348FEB7     //  Remember. Paulie finds out about Saul, you're payin'.
EA64CD28     //  I got it, Chris.
A12719C2     //  For the fifteenth fucking time.
F52BEC88     //  Get the fuck out.
2D817CFD     //  Chris, I'm sorry.
711610D2     //  The shit doctors do now? Who knows, maybe he still suits up.
113BBFCC     //  All right, stop! Stop! I'll miss a few kicks!
A30A85CF     //  A few?
7D873453     //  I'll throw the game! Whatever it takes!
65C1E7B8     //  All right, LaRocca, I got it from here.
E40B70C4     //  Hey, junior, Tony's looking for you.
321670D0     //  You and Tony's kid still "pals"? I fucking doubt it. 
314E6BA0     //  You still call Tony "Uncle T"? Bet he loves that shit. 
9AA7A303     //  Vito, I'm ordering take out-
5A37CFBA     //  Hey! My friend was talking to one of the strippers. I hear you fuckin' threw him out!
865A72C2     //  Yeah, then I beat his ass.
D022C14E     //  He pinched Jasmine. 
AB6F14E5     //  You fuckin' dick!
AAC6B3C2     //  Whoa! 
9658DBFB     //  I hurt your friend pretty bad. You wanna be next?
4465C6C0     //  You tell him Joey.
53B2685F     //  Get out of here, Jazz. This ain't something a lady should see.
A00A74D3     //  You want me to act all scared? Well fuck you, I ain't scared!
9BD98D6B     //  Hey, don't keep a captain waiting, kid.
4BCD6054     //  If I was Paulie, you'd be countin' your balls. 
C3F5FFB5     //  Hey, Joey? All these fine women here. How come you don't have a girlfriend?
5E39B898     //  I like to spread the wealth.
A840AB47     //  Thanks for dealing with that jerk, Joey. Can I give you a dance?
8EF5FD83     //  Hey, hey! There's a seniority system here.
79BF4FD8     //  Sorry Vito. I'll catch you later, Joey. 
43EA751A     //  Not bad, rookie. 
AC6885EA     //  Thanks Vito. So like I was saying before douchebag number two interrupted. I'm getting take-out. You want something?
D6FCC4A4     //  Lo-fat turkey, no bread, no mayo, no potato salad, just meat and a pickle.
C939C9FD     //  Paulie was just looking for you. Out front.
122ADA56     //  Heard some banging through the wall. That creep give you trouble?
BD8A080A     //  He was a fucking loser. Nothing to it.
4810928B     //  No cards for you, kid.
994F4332     //  Paulie says he's doing good. Let him lose some money.
CACF4105     //  Leave story mode and play poker?
6B8CBEEE     //  Thanks Uncle T. Maybe later.
7D898CAE     //  Thanks, I'll try not to embarrass you. 
0C6F6E42     //  Get Neil in on this. He's a born loser.
EB52AFB9     //  Hey, kid, Tony says go see him.
4D06EE3E     //  Next time I'm in the hospital, don't come visit. Send cash. 
FECC6C43     //  Look out, here comes Dr. Death.
54A6CACE     //  Joey. Did my future son-in-law do any of those skags at the Nighthorse?
2B48A79E     //  Why don't you ask him.
13FD357F     //  That's your answer?!
ABCA9215     //  Kevin's in deep shit. Jeannie knows he banged that hooker. 
B35CE621     //  Hey, I didn't tell nobody!
9D438899     //  My wife says a rash did him in. 
107DC310     //  Now the fucking wedding's in jeopardy.
B54D1287     //  Maybe you can get a refund.
CDCE2D3D     //  I oughta sue you, kid. My balls swole up like grapefruits.
5BA9EA2A     //  You lost your rug, Neil.
EC9522D5     //  So, am I okay with Tony now?
BDA40A71     //  Ask him yourself. I ain't your rabbi.
341DBCDA     //  Let's have a toot and bury the hatchet.
AB3D2E43     //  No, thanks.
69A11710     //  Hey, does blow make you impotent?
70A59407     //  E.D. A national fucking tragedy.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
43E25E20     //  Joey, it's Trishelle.
27A862DE     //  I gotta work late.
774DCAA1     //  Can we try again?
0AA3325C     //  Relax, it happens. What do you do, anyway?
DD7E20D9     //  Just boring internet stuff. I'll tell you when we go out, okay?
59CDE4A9     //  Call me. 
EBB318BF     //  Some drunk pinched Jasmine's ass.
619413CD     //  What's wrong? Paulie askin' for me?
3E5D1348     //  No, not that I've heard.
245A06F4     //  I know you're busy, Joey, but that loser upstairs won't change the music. 
1FAA2AE0     //  Could you talk to him?
E20F0508     //  For you, gorgeous? Any time.
F4905807     //  You aren't gonna help? I thought you were my friend.
9C8FD31F     //  I hate this D.J.
755A5945     //  Now this I can dance to. Wanna watch?
05C282A9     //  You know I usually charge big time for this.
7CA277BE     //  Hey, I'm happy to pay, beautiful.
18084AEB     //  Your mother raised you right, Joey. But this one's on me.
B51EAE74     //  He's a prick, but he's also Sil's cousin.
660179A3     //  My hands are tied. 
C0E97EDB     //  Tell me about it. I guess I'll have to let him diddle my tits.
F9189E78     //  Works every time. 
2728647E     //  Thanks again for the music, sweetie.
8B589144     //  I should be thanking you. That was fucking hot.
D13A367E     //  Nice work on the music.
A7B84CCF     //  Had to comp that asshole a special dance of love. 
13BD5BE3     //  Did Silvio find you?
1BB39174     //  Where is he?
7CB7CBA6     //  He was here a minute ago.
D8D1AEE5     //  You need a girlfriend, Joey.
04D653C3     //  I'm puttin' that on my To-Do list.
22F446B9     //  I hate working days. The tips suck.
C3542F9A     //  I'm working, Joey.
B79DA0E8     //  Must have been the music.
B444019B     //  Don't you have nothing to do today?
9F6E2E80     //  I'm talkin' to you, ain't I?
14EF1FCE     //  Go get laid, Joey.
9B3F8E82     //  How you doing, Joey?
B76D2E99     //  Been better.
40F9789E     //  I have a surefire remedy.
8B6A643D     //  Thought you'd never ask.
408C342B     //  Here, lemme take care of you.
8CEB6803     //  Come with me sweetie.
045E8AB4     //  No, not now.
99492C89     //  Then maybe later, huh?
EA7532A2     //  Ready for that dance?
FCD60D98     //  Should've said yes the first time.
D463C434     //  Come here honey.
62D8508F     //  Let's go upstairs.
59E17559     //  No, but don't take it personally
4978364B     //  You wanna keep going?
7582CB66     //  Abso-fucking-lutely.
AFFE86D3     //  I'm good.
89934F15     //  How you doing girl?
2273B528     //  Feeling better already. Want a dance?
2A3A881B     //  Sure, why not. You got time?
FEB40BDB     //  Are you kidding? For you?
393035E6     //  Thanks, but not right now.
BB964B24     //  You know where to find me.
3F377E3E     //  You got time for a dance yet?
271E420E     //  What the hell. Show me what ya' got.
1502141B     //  I got a lot Joey. Don't you know that?
0CF612E9     //  Answer's still no.
8378D450     //  Just asking.
0AC60E53     //  Can you stay a while baby?
9C61736B     //  I ain't going nowhere.
890D4A3A     //  Good, cause I'm not done with you yet.
62D96324     //  Not today.
EAC476BD     //  Don't usually see you sitting down.
CB5D2F99     //  Closing time, honey. Did Trishelle call?
4FBDC920     //  Not yet.
5253EA17     //  I'm going home soon, but if there's anything I can do, you call me.
C8D0DA9E     //  These heels are killing me.
8DCDA1F5     //  You're done dancing, take them off!
7712D5EA     //  And walk barefoot. In here? I could get leprosy...
862382F1     //  Reggie? What are you doing here? 
7993F26F     //  Thought I'd say hello... Find out if you talked to Paulie, you know, about me.
60611889     //  This ain't a club, Reg. They don't need new members.
AD6B36F4     //  Hey, Joey!
F906873E     //  Better see what he wants.
A90A01CE     //  What'd Paulie want?
127AC1B7     //  A fucking snack.
C8A58537     //  That's it?
6053115F     //  Listen, there's this party tonight...
3B5997E7     //  I'm working Reggie. Get the picture?
8A52906D     //  Paulie wants you. Said to go see him right now.
ADE9E7D1     //  Probably wants corned beef now. Where is he?
663CF967     //  In the can, along with his business associate.
61E18A59     //  Come on, hustle! He'll think I didn't tell you!
5970163A     //  Joey, he said now. The head.
5C62EA22     //  Can I do anything?
339B7C93     //  Stand here and look stupid. That shouldn't be a stretch. 
3102B785     //  You're making enemies left and right. Louis the Bat is a vengeful bastard. 
D62E67D7     //  Oh yeah?
AF5B1327     //  Yeah, you shoulda killed him when you had a chance.
ED33F948     //  No blood, that was the order.
FA2B89E2     //  And now you're in a war.
B358BC45     //  How you doing Debbie?
33240C7C     //  She's busy.
C3542F9A     //  I'm working, Joey.
35A80EAC     //  I didn't say you were done.
8861649D     //  You bought half an hour. You want more, pay more.
CEA9D291     //  Time's up, mister. You heard the lady.
98CBADEA     //  "Lady?" This skank?
01F04BE2     //  The room's closed, folks. Do your drinking up front.
C258A85B     //  What's going on?
FEB079CF     //  You're running quite a tab at the Nighthorse. We'd like to cover it for you. 
B508B522     //  I don't need your help.
3527DF10     //  Yes, you do. Now if you start missing kicks, bingo, your debt disappears. 
2E902A9B     //  Otherwise say hello to the injured list.
33258445     //  Hey! Fuck you.
9A95BD19     //  Let's get out of here, Chad.
B3CEC414     //  No broken bones, Joey. We need this guy healthy next Sunday.
F0E07487     //  Everything cool, Unique?
0FF1E9B4     //  Why wouldn't it be?
FED780DE     //  Joey, ya hear? I'm a free man again.
E6F2BDA2     //  You're really keeping her busy, Kev.
12F2CC70     //  I'm celebrating my freedom, dude.
80586752     //  Take a break, Deb.
EF8EA42A     //  Joey, what are you doing?
4D2A9054     //  So Jeannie called off the wedding.
8B560EDB     //  Can you believe that bitch? So I got a little pre-nuptial pussy. It was my bachelor party!
68FF55D4     //  Well, you fucked up, junior. You broke her heart and even worse, her father owes me money.
57C96816     //  Like that's my problem?
4F671302     //  It is now, Pancho.
FB7FA549     //  Half the wedding costs. Call it fifteen grand. 
7D300D4D     //  I'm not paying shit! SHE called it off! Not me!
BC292E05     //  Hey, pay your debt like a man.
562B9102     //  You threatening me? Fuck off!
265468B1     //  This is beautiful. Wish I had the wedding photographer here. 
F20E05E1     //  That's fifteen K to Neil. And another five to me. Capisce?
C86F184A     //  (Groans)
DBEE02EE     //  I'll take that as a yes. First installment due tomorrow. Ten thousand.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
C659AB13     //  I got the address for the chop shop. Let's go!
76D1BE1B     //  Go to the body shop now?
A601C25C     //  A.J? Cool it. Kinda busy. 
492D2DCA     //  Hey, this is my fuckin' life we're talking about!
A5576631     //  Hello, Doc. Who's your friend?
D19B3CD4     //  My ride home. I'm giving you my pink slip.
04ECB005     //  It's not a gift, it's a payment.
F7F93A45     //  Whatever.
CED5ACB9     //  ... And asking for another favor at the same time.
ECC2CB71     //  I'll wait downstairs.
32F8E3A0     //  I need a second loan.
1C983B82     //  I already got your car, you loser. What's your collateral now? 
4C236A53     //  I'm a doctor, for chrissakes! I just have a short-term, cash flow problem.
5E93C7FF     //  Like I fucking care. The rate goes up, of course. 
1B08430C     //  Shit. All right, fine.
2CC3B4DC     //  Give me a higher rate, and we have a deal.
D2A5FBC9     //  You can't get blood from a turnip, Joey.
CD71D568     //  Then leave me alone, all right?
A213C9E0     //  Maybe we can work something out. Slightly higher rate, of course. 
DA63549F     //  Higher rate? Sure... fine.
0A9D470C     //  As long you don't mind a slightly higher rate of return.
BE862CA6     //  You're killin' me, Joey.
3F0D2923     //  Hey, you got no choice. I'm the only bank you got, you pathetic fuck. 
0197842E     //  Fine, sorry. I'll take it.
2F2B76C5     //  Deal seems fair to me.
D44DC979     //  Well, it seems like usury to me. Forget it.
CCC490F6     //  Hey, it's your choice, pops. 
0757D6E4     //  I'll see what Angie Buscetta can offer.
7A1A95D4     //  Get the fuck out. 
6C876A34     //  I'm sure we can work something out.
98F7E933     //  God, am I glad to hear that. Same rate?
6BB98AFC     //  Of course. You just paid me with a CAR. 
EE9FAA53     //  I'm all out of cars.
18699B8F     //  All the more reason to jack up the vig.
8BC846D7     //  Fine, jack away!
F896E566     //  Sorry, it's gotta be a tad higher.
C6972AFA     //  I can't afford it, Joey. Thanks anyway. 
572131CD     //  Come on, Doc. More risk, greater return.
901AABC0     //  Which means a higher rate?
AD3DD7F5     //  What do you think, Einstein?
19098316     //  Fine. 
BD0A7695     //  Nice doing business, Doc.
3A23922E     //  Wish I could say the same.
A22BC055     //  Joey, you've gotten too cocky for this business.
B3A3CB6F     //  And you've gotten too gutless, old man.
0ACF2E85     //  Looks like you could use a little R & R, Joey.
243A8CE1     //  Cool. A free dance?
F7C88603     //  No, but I'll give you a discount.
3207AEC6     //  You're a fuckin' doll.
AE0DF93F     //  I know.
5730F17E     //  Follow me darling.
F877809B     //  Maybe in a bit.
138A01E5     //  Anytime you want. I'm here to serve.
6761D07D     //  Look who's back. You want to play now?
712F116E     //  Fucking A. Let's do this.
A0A14745     //  Let the fun begin.
E4DEC493     //  Upstairs. It's private.
DC47CD44     //  Sorry babe, no time.
67442B40     //  You want another one Joe?
81539185     //  What do you think?
67C3B9CA     //  Why stop now?
24751B14     //  No, I gotta pace myself.
D0ED7548     //  Nice to see ya' cutie.
BC93BBB6     //  How ya been, Jazz?
6BB772F2     //  Fine. I'd be better if I could dance for a good looking guy though.
414623DA     //  Wonder if I can help with that?
4038D4E3     //  I think you got a shot.
5F056276     //  Let's go upstairs, and find out.
644C1F65     //  Maybe I'll help you later.
13A7ED31     //  I'm gonna hold ya to it.
68A309D3     //  You want some company Joey?
A39541E4     //  Yea. I could use it.
408C342B     //  Here, lemme take care of you.
8CEB6803     //  Come with me sweetie.
F48590EE     //  I would. But I can't right now.
FB8946FB     //  You still wanna party?
2C6AA873     //  I never said to stop in the first place.
21F49B5C     //  That's my boy.
52C71B06     //  That's all I got time for Jazz.
19654569     //  That rave last night... didn't I see you?
A5DE440F     //  I stay away from those things. 
F1BE8002     //  Whatever you say, Joey. Want a dance?
C5DCC5AB     //  Sure, if you insist.
8A3FA700     //  That's my job, honey.
D3067169     //  Come upstairs then.
22DCB01C     //  How 'bout later?
4F6F7D83     //  Whenever you want.
0525FC53     //  You want a dance Joey?
FAAEA543     //  Sure, Jazz, the full treatment.
8B6A643D     //  Thought you'd never ask.
475B92EB     //  Let's go somewhere more private.
838CCB84     //  Can't do it Jazz. Maybe later.
D9EA91AB     //  You want me to keep going?
81539185     //  What do you think?
F13007DC     //  Just checkin'.
9E11D861     //  Yea I do, but I gotta get going.
ABF5BDBD     //  Just when I was getting warmed up too.
F8CD25F6     //  I hear you're seeing someone, Joey.
9D3C7F6C     //  Word travels fast around here.
4F895985     //  Just keep her happy, okay?
E4AC232A     //  That's the general idea. 
8C925CAC     //  Unique, everything all right?
608E7F3F     //  Sure, Joey, I'm good. 
5FACDE2A     //  I was hoping you'd stop by.
6493186E     //  What for?
7B50AA77     //  Cause I want to party with you. Interested?
DFE7713A     //  I could be convinced.
C46C13E3     //  Right this way, stud boy.
14167ED4     //  Very interested, but I can't right now.
A85283F3     //  Then find me when you're free.
0459C5FB     //  Just tell me what you want, good-looking.
B4072829     //  I want you. Now.
76F002EC     //  Well, damn, here I am.
F27A52D5     //  I wish to hell that I could, but I can't.
0F9BE6C3     //  Just say the word and I'm there.
86BC313E     //  You want another?
82C7B42D     //  Keep 'em coming.
7E379AE0     //  Until you say stop. 
EFA9B8CB     //  I want ten more, but I gotta split.
514FBF9E     //  When're you gonna get a dance from me, huh?
BC9E51BD     //  Whenever you want I guess.
8EB7CB6C     //  How 'bout now?
8BC37C44     //  You talked me into it hot stuff.
9838E7D9     //  Good. I've missed you baby.
1C313BA3     //  I'm busy. Next time sweetheart - I promise.
16FA0EB5     //  That's what you always say.
28D79FAB     //  Can you handle a dance from me yet?
428A9F9F     //  I'll do my best to hold on.
DC47CD44     //  Sorry babe, no time.
3C67542C     //  Let me give you another one - please Joey?
340BA1DC     //  You talked me into it.
1FB11786     //  I'd stay all day if I could, but I got shit to do.
A65B795D     //  Where's your friend Reggie? He's a great tipper.
82F1C39D     //  Why would I know?! I'm not his fuckin' goomah.
F6526544     //  What'd I say? I'm sorry. You want a dance?
DEFA3885     //  Sure, if you forget about Reggie.
79F08479     //  Anything you want baby.
B0E1E952     //  No, I'm not in the mood
3966CEEB     //  How about now, Joey? You want a dance?
653D048B     //  Maybe I oughta.
F1F0354F     //  It's very therapeutic.
7DE65D21     //  I'm fine, get back to work.
AC4DCCE5     //  Tell me you want another.
38C74A25     //  I want another.
7D3FE16A     //  I was hoping you'd say that.
DAFEB665     //  When I do, I will.
9FD606D0     //  It was good, wasn't it? I can do better.
0CF64DBF     //  Your friend Neil is seriously fucked up.
C959AB28     //  Major drug casualty.
172BCE78     //  Can't get it up, poor baby. Want a ride?
2B428292     //  Probably shouldn't, but why not?
31AFB8B1     //  Then sit down and hold on.
228516B8     //  Thanks, but no thanks.
C25A0199     //  Tell me what you want, baby.
E1D3FD79     //  You still available?
7A4E231C     //  Let me check my date book.
7C01BC4E     //  Just saying hello.
D9684D98     //  Well, you definitely don't have Neil's problem. Wanna go again?
0654B55D     //  You noticed, huh?
7FC7FE21     //  Is it really true about your toes?
2868289A     //  God damn Neil!
41AE3841     //  Shit. Forgot. Wallet's a little light.
60AF6024     //  You want in? Pull up a chair.
4E65AFA6     //  Thanks T. Maybe later.
09146068     //  I'd love to.
11F4A4F8     //  Well, we need a new patsy...
E5171C80     //  I got some time to kill. Anyone up for a game?
E3CA0A8A     //  Hey, pal Joey! How's it going? 
6A79D8BC     //  Can't complain.
1C170A97     //  Listen, Nicky - you gotta mix it up a little. The girls are getting pissy.
E7AC1421     //  So what's new? Tell 'em to fuck off, I don't take no requests, all right?
722EB198     //  C'mon, man, they're bustin' my balls down there.
8E756B19     //  Silvio said I could play what I want. That's what I'm doing.
43F2F313     //  Nicky, I know Sil's your cousin, but you're fucking killin' me down there.
B663D160     //  As a favor to you then. Just this once. 
6459E8B5     //  I know Sil's your cousin, but cut me a little slack.
5335BC23     //  Sorry, Joey, no can do. I'm sick of their bitchin'.
654D995E     //  Nick, you're fuckin' up Sil's business. You hear me, fuckhead?
FF030CEF     //  All right, fine. Here.
143B325D     //  Can you just change it?
86ED9777     //  And if I don't? Silvio said to play whatever I want.
0E54676F     //  Let's ask cousin Sil what he prefers.
9CD2C7E7     //  Jesus Joey, I was just kiddin', all right? Here you go.
7DEAA989     //  Nicky, wake up - the girls still have to dance to it.
FD7470EA     //  I'm fucking tired of getting ragged on.
28E6EF59     //  I ain't changing it.
2817DBEE     //  Every time it's a fight with you. Fucking change it - now!
154B4A86     //  Fine, whatever. This is such bullshit. Here.
F123FD6B     //  Then consider it an order, asswipe. Change it!
D6FF99A8     //  Fuck that! Silvio says I can play what I want.
E34EB0AE     //  I know Silvio's your cousin, but you gotta keep the ladies happy.
088AEBF6     //  I am so fucking tired of hearing them bitch and moan. 
D11CFF8F     //  Can you just humor them a little? 
77B5B184     //  No! The slits are getting ridiculous. The music stays.
72F3EBE8     //  Your loving cousin also said I could break your fuckin' head.
B71888CA     //  Well, Sil is gonna fuckin' hear about this, I guaran-fuckin-tee you. Here...
A9170970     //  Okay, maybe this will shut them up. 
6F595EA6     //  Go piss on somebody else, okay?
61904730     //  Don't tell me you're here again about the music. 
CC0F92A2     //  I'm here about the music. Play something new, Nicky , and stop giving me shit.
1FDF07C8     //  Who's the fuckin' DJ here, you or me?
120FBBD6     //  Hey, fuckhead, it'll be hard to spin those records with broken thumbs, right?
CAEE1E3E     //  Send one of the bimbos up. She can pick a whole set.
D53B411F     //  Just change the music. What's the problem?
D395E0EB     //  Unless it comes from Sil, I ain't changing shit.
0B686A8E     //  You are. But the clientele wanna hear something different.
4AB9C055     //  What clientele? I ain't heard no one complainin'.
5BD8BD1F     //  I'm giving you the fuckin' order. Change the fuckin' music!
14D71F0B     //  Ok, ok, sure, chill out. Try this.
8630D8BD     //  I'm just trying to keep everyone happy.
433889FF     //  I'm not changing shit unless Silvio gives me the word.
4C09043D     //  People at the bar, the girls... They make the money, remember? Keep 'em happy.
5B115A9D     //  Only if Sil gives the order. 
ADE14513     //  Does Silvio know you grope the merchandise during business hours?
6B04176C     //  Calm down, I'll change the music, all right?
EADC4E39     //  Sorry. No groping. They're tired of getting groped.
E947525E     //  I'm just having fun! You want new music? Fine. 
3BBE5A52     //  They're working their butts off, same as you. Now how bout it?
A3DF57BB     //  Sure thing Joey. Here you go.
2B3A6A68     //  I appreciate it.
88F27CF6     //  Go away, asshole.
9ED74D0B     //  You again? What is it this time?
20C6AF8A     //  Just play something different. And no crap!
07610F90     //  Lemme guess. Different music, right?
182DFEA2     //  Fucking mind reader here.
66172FE0     //  Not that big a mind to read.
40DE60C6     //  Can we get something different on?
68123A8E     //  Come on Joey, you serious?
FB8AF938     //  Don't fuck with me. Change it.
8E174BB1     //  Ok, what did you wanna hear?
6A347F52     //  Surprise me.
7DA1E6F7     //  Look who's fuckin' back.
10BCA174     //  I'm not in the mood, asshole. Just change it.
654BB9FC     //  Sure, no prob.
C719D9F7     //  Play something else?
B8899175     //  You read my mind.
4F65737F     //  Tony's like your uncle or something, right? Sorry about before.
8C463214     //  Forget about it.
6F466185     //  Want me to mix it up a little?
6DF09456     //  Yeah, do that.
C0D6F937     //  Can we change the channel?
1F1D53D7     //  Hey, I'm all over it, boss.
A6166CB1     //  What's up, Joey?
2A774B28     //  Same request, different music.
AD8C3754     //  You got it.
AE4EA9FF     //  Forget hockey. It's idiotic. Bunch of thugs.
80BF81D8     //  Baseball, my friend, is a game for intellectuals.
192D9EE7     //  Then why do you like it?
3E201308     //  Ho! Watch your fucking mouth!
6C75DE0C     //  Hey Paulie, here's this week.
76925F28     //  Not bad, junior.
E1FA79B0     //  Anytime you're ready to express your gratitude, the envelope's always waiting.
FA9869D0     //  Understood. You need anything else?
1ED2C0AC     //  I'm taking my ma to Fernando's For Hair. 
7E739477     //  Check in with T. He's in the office.
525C1196     //  See, this one shows a little respect. 
8F18D284     //  Like he's got a choice. He works for you.
794C4A21     //  Generosity, my friend, is a virtue not an obligation. 
9C35C8CA     //  That's bullshit, Paulie!
48267576     //  A $25,000 watch! That's kinda hard to miss.
BD01EC71     //  Fuckin Reggie...
03D9B614     //  Never wear a dead man's watch, 'specially if you whacked the guy.
4D00AAEF     //  Paulie's gonna be pissed.
7A269BAD     //  I gotta tell him?
94FB2506     //  Better you than someone else.
C2DFFA82     //  Is he sober this time?
E44DBA1A     //  Only cause he just got here.
95BD8B5E     //  He's in the lounge next door.
69469788     //  Then go lean on him. Take Joey.
62AE120F     //  Like I need him? We're not talking about a left guard, T.
53E7B771     //  After you're done, we'll finish our conversation.
7A4E0464     //  The guy kicks field goals, Tony.
FE5AD58E     //  He doesn't even wear pads!
7E83F7CB     //  You want me to tell Tony? That's bullshit. I ain't a rat.
61E644E7     //  You put a cap in your best friend and you think you're better than me?
E1F753D9     //  You let your best friend go down and you think you're better than me?
6D6E819B     //  I'm keepin' my word with A.J.
889E7D08     //  Then find that chop shop.

15DED26C     //  Painful, no doubt, but not my problem.
ECF42ED9     //  Do you know where Unique is?
64A7439E     //  Probably in back. Who's asking?

DA28F7E8     //  The guy disrespected me, Tone.

0DAE774C     //  That's eighty two hundred you owe me.
05E2C47A     //  Maybe I been making a mistake, letting Neil sit in with us.

F751D1AC     //  It's over, Paulie.
A5CC51F7     //  Now that's a beautiful timepiece.
45A67AAF     //  Don't you start wearing that thing.
9E36C47E     //  Give it here.

98CBADEA     //  "Lady?" This skank?
E1B8AACD     //  Now, where the hell were you? I'm starving out here. 
BD65C4F9     //  Get me a pastrami sandwich with Dijon mustard. And see if Tony wants anything.

11BE4020     //  Paulie, how you doing?
642ECFA4     //  Not now, kid. We're having a conversation.
87AB6C4F     //  Joey! This is private!
02562616     //  You didn't hear me before? Get lost.
9C36D1C7     //  Don't just stand there! This ain't happy hour.
39D48FE9     //  Take over. My manicure is fuckin' ruined.
B95FA700     //  What happened?
FE945D91     //  Pound this cocksucker. Or maybe you like seeing your captain disrespected?

0A1C671A     //  Looks pretty real to me.
FE6BFEA7     //  Enough already. Clean him up.
A262AC48     //  Head first.
EC443520     //  All right, forget that fuck.
0282F4CC     //  Why'd you hit his head so hard?
6CF16B88     //  Hey, we both kicked his ass, Paulie! Remember?
5E7CF126     //  I didn't think he was gonna fuckin' die! Get him out of here.
1908415A     //  Because you told me to, boss.
AD6EAA88     //  Don't act smart. Get him out of here.
82C9C4B9     //  You didn't tell me he was a bleeder.
0B04600E     //  Don't be fuckin' stupid! Get him out of here.
29D63784     //  Me? 
D1FC80EE     //  Yeah, you. Get rid of the body, his car, his piece, this blood bath, all of it. And no fuck-ups!

824AF397     //  Hey, LaRocca. You got people waiting.
4A0B3123     //  Hey Paulie. You ever in the, ah, car business?
508A3E09     //  I've been in every business, my friend.
A2EFD089     //  I heard about this shop in Newark -
85B7B255     //  Motherfucker! Guess who's celebrating his non-marriage to my little girl with a fucking lapdance?
A1C99E05     //  He's rubbing your nose in it, Neil.
220914F8     //  He broke my daughter's heart and cost me a fuckin' fortune!
F8867F4E     //  And you still owe me for the other night.
0228C033     //  I'm bleeding money, Paulie.
CC191BD2     //  Then maybe the groom should pony up some guilt money. Joey, let's go say hello.
D8DF5160     //  If Neil don't cough up what he owes, I'm sending you.
0E7C2735     //  Whenever you want, Paulie.
1355365E     //  Fucking lawyers. Quick to bill, slow to pay.
8703145C     //  The boss wants you... In back.
E387487D     //  So, Tuzzio got shot, fell off the roof, and still survived? Fuckin' miracle of medicine.
0C445FF5     //  Not anymore, it isn't.
04C0E66E     //  When you pulled the plug, what happened?
238FB07D     //  Wasn't pretty.
758257B1     //  Sorry kid. No cards for you 'til Tony gives the word.
33DFD975     //  You'll get there. Just not tonight.
06B8FDC2     //  What's keeping Paulie? He oughta be done with the Philly fanatic by now. 
F233F3FB     //  Debbie show you a little gratitude?
2FE56F3F     //  She didn't have to.
7D27AACC     //  Paulie still out there?
370FAA8F     //  Just left. Taking his ma to get her hair done. 
8025C7A1     //  He told me you were in charge of cleaning up the john the other night.
A221BB6C     //  That's right. Me and Reggie did it. Everything okay?
13A99009     //  Next time use more ammonia.
7A2F8604     //  Blood leaves a metallic smell, needs a strong disinfectant.
4ABCAD8B     //  What's with all the loitering? Paulie ain't occupying your precious time? 
F8B33AB6     //  He had me running around all week!
08BE3637     //  Stay busy kid.
71EED76A     //  You did good work on the john. There's a lot more that needs cleaning around this dump.
C50CEB64     //  Joey. Professor McNally was fillin' me in here on a unique business opportunity. 
4FF69E6A     //  Okay....
4C81A2D8     //  Thought I'd be a silent partner but the prof here thinks it's unethical.
AB95CB63     //  A big investment, two weeks before clinical results come in? To the SEC, that's insider trading.

6246A323     //  I can't tell you, it's against the law.
E845032D     //  Then I hope your classroom is wheelchair accessible.
9DB7EF0C     //  My God. You're actually threatening me.
DCFC3DE1     //  It's more like a promise.
AB8FF89F     //  So you're gonna refuse your friend?
47EC2CD6     //  Like I said, it's a question of ethics.
0AEDC160     //  Sharing with your friends. That ain't ethical?
645BBD51     //  Not in this case. 
09B98F02     //  So's jaywalking. But most people do it anyway.
9E8E8E54     //  I'm sorry. But that kind of facile logic just isn't going to work.
4DC4C2D3     //  Whatever the fuck that means.
D294F58F     //  I thought he'd listen to reason. Guess we'll have to move on to violence.
C03F202F     //  What?! 
3B37DAC1     //  Sorry professor. Cough up that name, or you'll be takin' a permanent sabbatical.
A0544E58     //  Wait! The company's called... Slate-Boxton Pharmaceuticals.
94B00DDC     //  I'll go in for thirty grand. The Feds'll never notice.
A90EBE89     //  Jesus Christ.
FAC5BD53     //  I can't believe this is happening.

C6FABA21     //  Go to Satriale's now?
B1F13B37     //  Nice work with the professor, kid. If the stock hits, I'll give you a piece.
9D9B8901     //  Thanks, Sil. I know shit about stocks.
B6D1F031     //  If the stock goes up, we make money. If it goes down, the professor covers the loss.

378C8BA8     //  Ho! What the fuck?
D183A3A7     //  I just hurt the guy, Paulie, as a favor to Sil.
CC868DB0     //  Then whatever taste you get, as your captain, I take half.
75F28421     //  No problem.
B73A8D8E     //  Joey, chop, chop.

50C6EE72     //  He can look, but not touch. Those are the rules. 
2D3E7D5F     //  Hey, you're a defense attorney, counselor, not a prosecutor.
6BFED4E2     //  I feel sorry for the fuckin' kid, marrying into the Perry Mason family.
93516DDE     //  How's Paulie's little meeting going out there?
130B2A30     //  The guy's a fuckin' moron, if you ask me.
CA4AA734     //  Considering his family, not a big surprise. 
82B0BB50     //  The guy called Paulie, you know, stupid.
B15F75E1     //  Ho! And he thinks he's gonna make a fuckin' deal?
6E1BF9DE     //  Looks a little intense. 
CA89030C     //  Fucking Philly cheesesteaks. Every time they gotta whip it out.
ACBC1415     //  Who is he?
8D5035F8     //  Hey, if you needed to know, you'd already know, Junior G-Man.
57EB44B6     //  Sil told me 'bout that drunk outside. Nice work.
FD6F1E83     //  Thanks Uncle T.
67B9B255     //  Hey, I don't care how many times you hung out with Tony's kids. You still ain't a blood relative. 
C219CEA7     //  Chrissy's on the rag. Neil cleaned him out. I'm just picking the bones.
C6290946     //  Did you see Vito yet? He's in the lounge. The man might be hungry.
86908B55     //  I heard you ran into a little trouble at the casino the other night.
110AC9A2     //  Just a couple of assholes from high school. 
E1A8C2E4     //  Yeah, that shit never ends.
42F78F47     //  It was no big deal.
02EE5A69     //  Good, glad to hear it.
C0DFB74F     //  Wasn't my fault, Tone.
9CD899FA     //  Neil's son-in-law is a real piece of work, huh?
F471C408     //  Didn't mean to cause trouble, T.
E374B4C7     //  Uh, guys your age, you need to... sow wild oats, so to speak. Don't worry about it.
CAF5B887     //  Joey. Debbie's dancing for some creep next door.
B8EC1E7C     //  Take a look, would you?
64B47B47     //  Sure thing, Sil.
6060EA55     //  Tony, you need anything?
0A70EEAB     //  Go check out that girl Debbie, like Sil asked. You like her, right?
0DCD9DEA     //  We get along, yeah.
07BF34EE     //  You two ever... 
B7571A9C     //  Debbie? Not that kind. Now Jasmine, she's a different story.
8BADB9D3     //  Careful there. A bit of a revolving door, I hear. 
EAC30D30     //  Fuck! Mikey told me the same thing.
64133E9A     //  Joey! Go! Debbie, now.
CB38D6F3     //  Everything good next door?
A6969E3F     //  It is now.
1AF56EBF     //  Get out there kid. Chrissy's waitin'.
558E4266     //  In the lounge. Go, go!
28E7A8CA     //  You talk to that kicker?
A6B2FD78     //  He won't be kickin' right on Sunday.
89A714FC     //  It's covered, Tone. He's cooperating.
D35745E4     //  So, as I was saying... you're startin' to impress me, kid. 
3FC136C8     //  I've been ridin' his ass, T.
DCB1326C     //  There's a party at Vesuvio's next week. Hesh's nephew's Bar Mitzvah.
A4B93E50     //  Everyone's coming, including you
E16F00B7     //  Hey, Tone, thanks. Should I bring a gift?
C3A302E9     //  Fifty bucks in an envelope. Kids that age, all they want is cash.
59CF4FAF     //  Bring fifty-four. It's a sacred number. Some Jewish ka-blah-blah shit.
2D3BD229     //  Go to the Bar Mitzvah now?
A5C21FB3     //  Uh, excuse me, Tone. You seen Paulie?
95F38F16     //  Try in back.
CFFF8223     //  What now?
7BB9AE8A     //  Excuse me, this is a private conversation.
3AA992B8     //  Closing time already. I'm gonna check the take.
DAAF2343     //  I talked with A.J. after we got home.
DAD237EE     //  He says you saved his life and the whole mess was his, not yours.
CD9F85FD     //  We were in it together. I'm sorry, Tony. I shoulda come right to you. 
8CA85BE8     //  He says he asked you not to, and that you were keeping your word and not rattin' him out. If I wasn't pissed off, I'd be impressed. 
00D13C89     //  I won't fuck up again, Tony, I swear.
D43B8AE4     //  Well, you ain't gonna get the chance for a long time. 
86FB8124     //  You got something to say now?
91B0B453     //  Excuse me, T. It's important.
0F2851A9     //  Jesus Christ, Sil. I'm in a meeting!
DAEB30A8     //  Tony! He's gone.
54675691     //  Guess the meetin's over.
B873E3AC     //  Oh yeah. Angelo just returned your car. 
F61BB0FD     //  You got a big heart, Tone. Putting Big Pussy's bastard kid on the payroll.
AD0C15AE     //  My mother raised me. I didn't have shit to do with my old man.
FDC69228     //  I wasn't talking to you. Was I?
67E8499D     //  Hey, I'm standing right here!
1668047B     //  And you can thank Tony for that. Your old man was a rat, like it or not.
1E4167D7     //  Sorry to tell you kid. Chris ain't wrong.
EBC48049     //  Good point. 
CA90E5BC     //  Then keep your mouth shut. It ain't my fault your old man was a rat.
7E364385     //  Bring it down a notch, will ya?
3E6D9E75     //  I know, but you're talking about me.
B4990D96     //  You're old man was a rat. That's what I know.
A4BB2F6E     //  Let him be, Christopher.
C93C27F1     //  If I want advice, I'll ask someone else.
9BE90CC2     //  Looks like you oughta.
EBC8DC97     //  He's got you there, Chrissy
7CF8B7EE     //  You're supposed to see T, remember?
32923F4A     //  I'm all over it.
C345FAEC     //  You gonna be free later? I might need something.
AC631BCB     //  That's up to Paulie.
D1CE7AE5     //  What a wimp dick.
59BAC757     //  Hey, LaRocca, over here. Chop chop.
1124C50D     //  I gotta go. Thanks, Joey, you're a sweetheart.
CDBDD06C     //  I gotta make a collection. This punk who runs the gym's been holding back. You're coming with me.
1CB15B5E     //  I work for Paulie!
90EF28C4     //  Then he better not find out, right?
78914120     //  This is bullshit, Chris. He's a captain!
069B5E6F     //  And so am I. What are you gonna do? Tell the principal?
B861D809     //  Fuck.
4840CCB3     //  Go to the Gym with Chris now?
CB77DCE1     //  Is Paulie around?
4EA4209A     //  If he knows about Saul, it's coming our of your pocket, jerkoff. 
21AEAFA4     //  I got it. You seen him?
0F155D72     //  What am I, your fuckin' advance man?
6348FEB7     //  Remember. Paulie finds out about Saul, you're payin'.
EA64CD28     //  I got it, Chris.
A12719C2     //  For the fifteenth fucking time.
F52BEC88     //  Get the fuck out.
2D817CFD     //  Chris, I'm sorry.
711610D2     //  The shit doctors do now? Who knows, maybe he still suits up.
113BBFCC     //  All right, stop! Stop! I'll miss a few kicks!
A30A85CF     //  A few?
7D873453     //  I'll throw the game! Whatever it takes!
65C1E7B8     //  All right, LaRocca, I got it from here.
E40B70C4     //  Hey, junior, Tony's looking for you.
321670D0     //  You and Tony's kid still "pals"? I fucking doubt it. 
314E6BA0     //  You still call Tony "Uncle T"? Bet he loves that shit. 
9AA7A303     //  Vito, I'm ordering take out-
5A37CFBA     //  Hey! My friend was talking to one of the strippers. I hear you fuckin' threw him out!
865A72C2     //  Yeah, then I beat his ass.
D022C14E     //  He pinched Jasmine. 
AB6F14E5     //  You fuckin' dick!
AAC6B3C2     //  Whoa! 
9658DBFB     //  I hurt your friend pretty bad. You wanna be next?
4465C6C0     //  You tell him Joey.
53B2685F     //  Get out of here, Jazz. This ain't something a lady should see.
A00A74D3     //  You want me to act all scared? Well fuck you, I ain't scared!
9BD98D6B     //  Hey, don't keep a captain waiting, kid.
4BCD6054     //  If I was Paulie, you'd be countin' your balls. 
C3F5FFB5     //  Hey, Joey? All these fine women here. How come you don't have a girlfriend?
5E39B898     //  I like to spread the wealth.
A840AB47     //  Thanks for dealing with that jerk, Joey. Can I give you a dance?
8EF5FD83     //  Hey, hey! There's a seniority system here.
79BF4FD8     //  Sorry Vito. I'll catch you later, Joey. 
43EA751A     //  Not bad, rookie. 
AC6885EA     //  Thanks Vito. So like I was saying before douchebag number two interrupted. I'm getting take-out. You want something?
D6FCC4A4     //  Lo-fat turkey, no bread, no mayo, no potato salad, just meat and a pickle.
C939C9FD     //  Paulie was just looking for you. Out front.
122ADA56     //  Heard some banging through the wall. That creep give you trouble?
BD8A080A     //  He was a fucking loser. Nothing to it.
4810928B     //  No cards for you, kid.
994F4332     //  Paulie says he's doing good. Let him lose some money.
CACF4105     //  Leave story mode and play poker?
6B8CBEEE     //  Thanks Uncle T. Maybe later.
7D898CAE     //  Thanks, I'll try not to embarrass you. 
0C6F6E42     //  Get Neil in on this. He's a born loser.
EB52AFB9     //  Hey, kid, Tony says go see him.
4D06EE3E     //  Next time I'm in the hospital, don't come visit. Send cash. 
FECC6C43     //  Look out, here comes Dr. Death.
54A6CACE     //  Joey. Did my future son-in-law do any of those skags at the Nighthorse?
2B48A79E     //  Why don't you ask him.
13FD357F     //  That's your answer?!
ABCA9215     //  Kevin's in deep shit. Jeannie knows he banged that hooker. 
B35CE621     //  Hey, I didn't tell nobody!
9D438899     //  My wife says a rash did him in. 
107DC310     //  Now the fucking wedding's in jeopardy.
B54D1287     //  Maybe you can get a refund.
CDCE2D3D     //  I oughta sue you, kid. My balls swole up like grapefruits.
5BA9EA2A     //  You lost your rug, Neil.
EC9522D5     //  So, am I okay with Tony now?
BDA40A71     //  Ask him yourself. I ain't your rabbi.
341DBCDA     //  Let's have a toot and bury the hatchet.
AB3D2E43     //  No, thanks.
69A11710     //  Hey, does blow make you impotent?
70A59407     //  E.D. A national fucking tragedy.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
43E25E20     //  Joey, it's Trishelle.
27A862DE     //  I gotta work late.
774DCAA1     //  Can we try again?
0AA3325C     //  Relax, it happens. What do you do, anyway?
DD7E20D9     //  Just boring internet stuff. I'll tell you when we go out, okay?
59CDE4A9     //  Call me. 
EBB318BF     //  Some drunk pinched Jasmine's ass.
619413CD     //  What's wrong? Paulie askin' for me?
3E5D1348     //  No, not that I've heard.
245A06F4     //  I know you're busy, Joey, but that loser upstairs won't change the music. 
1FAA2AE0     //  Could you talk to him?
E20F0508     //  For you, gorgeous? Any time.
F4905807     //  You aren't gonna help? I thought you were my friend.
9C8FD31F     //  I hate this D.J.
755A5945     //  Now this I can dance to. Wanna watch?
05C282A9     //  You know I usually charge big time for this.
7CA277BE     //  Hey, I'm happy to pay, beautiful.
18084AEB     //  Your mother raised you right, Joey. But this one's on me.
B51EAE74     //  He's a prick, but he's also Sil's cousin.
660179A3     //  My hands are tied. 
C0E97EDB     //  Tell me about it. I guess I'll have to let him diddle my tits.
F9189E78     //  Works every time. 
2728647E     //  Thanks again for the music, sweetie.
8B589144     //  I should be thanking you. That was fucking hot.
D13A367E     //  Nice work on the music.
A7B84CCF     //  Had to comp that asshole a special dance of love. 
13BD5BE3     //  Did Silvio find you?
1BB39174     //  Where is he?
7CB7CBA6     //  He was here a minute ago.
D8D1AEE5     //  You need a girlfriend, Joey.
04D653C3     //  I'm puttin' that on my To-Do list.
22F446B9     //  I hate working days. The tips suck.
C3542F9A     //  I'm working, Joey.
B79DA0E8     //  Must have been the music.
B444019B     //  Don't you have nothing to do today?
9F6E2E80     //  I'm talkin' to you, ain't I?
14EF1FCE     //  Go get laid, Joey.
9B3F8E82     //  How you doing, Joey?
B76D2E99     //  Been better.
40F9789E     //  I have a surefire remedy.
8B6A643D     //  Thought you'd never ask.
408C342B     //  Here, lemme take care of you.
8CEB6803     //  Come with me sweetie.
045E8AB4     //  No, not now.
99492C89     //  Then maybe later, huh?
EA7532A2     //  Ready for that dance?
FCD60D98     //  Should've said yes the first time.
D463C434     //  Come here honey.
62D8508F     //  Let's go upstairs.
59E17559     //  No, but don't take it personally
4978364B     //  You wanna keep going?
7582CB66     //  Abso-fucking-lutely.
AFFE86D3     //  I'm good.
89934F15     //  How you doing girl?
2273B528     //  Feeling better already. Want a dance?
2A3A881B     //  Sure, why not. You got time?
FEB40BDB     //  Are you kidding? For you?
393035E6     //  Thanks, but not right now.
BB964B24     //  You know where to find me.
3F377E3E     //  You got time for a dance yet?
271E420E     //  What the hell. Show me what ya' got.
1502141B     //  I got a lot Joey. Don't you know that?
0CF612E9     //  Answer's still no.
8378D450     //  Just asking.
0AC60E53     //  Can you stay a while baby?
9C61736B     //  I ain't going nowhere.
890D4A3A     //  Good, cause I'm not done with you yet.
62D96324     //  Not today.
EAC476BD     //  Don't usually see you sitting down.
CB5D2F99     //  Closing time, honey. Did Trishelle call?
4FBDC920     //  Not yet.
5253EA17     //  I'm going home soon, but if there's anything I can do, you call me.
C8D0DA9E     //  These heels are killing me.
8DCDA1F5     //  You're done dancing, take them off!
7712D5EA     //  And walk barefoot. In here? I could get leprosy...
862382F1     //  Reggie? What are you doing here? 
7993F26F     //  Thought I'd say hello... Find out if you talked to Paulie, you know, about me.
60611889     //  This ain't a club, Reg. They don't need new members.
AD6B36F4     //  Hey, Joey!
F906873E     //  Better see what he wants.
A90A01CE     //  What'd Paulie want?
127AC1B7     //  A fucking snack.
C8A58537     //  That's it?
6053115F     //  Listen, there's this party tonight...
3B5997E7     //  I'm working Reggie. Get the picture?
8A52906D     //  Paulie wants you. Said to go see him right now.
ADE9E7D1     //  Probably wants corned beef now. Where is he?
663CF967     //  In the can, along with his business associate.
61E18A59     //  Come on, hustle! He'll think I didn't tell you!
5970163A     //  Joey, he said now. The head.
5C62EA22     //  Can I do anything?
339B7C93     //  Stand here and look stupid. That shouldn't be a stretch. 
3102B785     //  You're making enemies left and right. Louis the Bat is a vengeful bastard. 
D62E67D7     //  Oh yeah?
AF5B1327     //  Yeah, you shoulda killed him when you had a chance.
ED33F948     //  No blood, that was the order.
FA2B89E2     //  And now you're in a war.
B358BC45     //  How you doing Debbie?
33240C7C     //  She's busy.
C3542F9A     //  I'm working, Joey.
01F04BE2     //  The room's closed, folks. Do your drinking up front.
C258A85B     //  What's going on?
FEB079CF     //  You're running quite a tab at the Nighthorse. We'd like to cover it for you. 
B508B522     //  I don't need your help.
3527DF10     //  Yes, you do. Now if you start missing kicks, bingo, your debt disappears. 
2E902A9B     //  Otherwise say hello to the injured list.
33258445     //  Hey! Fuck you.
9A95BD19     //  Let's get out of here, Chad.
B3CEC414     //  No broken bones, Joey. We need this guy healthy next Sunday.
F0E07487     //  Everything cool, Unique?
0FF1E9B4     //  Why wouldn't it be?
FED780DE     //  Joey, ya hear? I'm a free man again.
E6F2BDA2     //  You're really keeping her busy, Kev.
12F2CC70     //  I'm celebrating my freedom, dude.
80586752     //  Take a break, Deb.
EF8EA42A     //  Joey, what are you doing?
4D2A9054     //  So Jeannie called off the wedding.
8B560EDB     //  Can you believe that bitch? So I got a little pre-nuptial pussy. It was my bachelor party!
68FF55D4     //  Well, you fucked up, junior. You broke her heart and even worse, her father owes me money.
57C96816     //  Like that's my problem?
4F671302     //  It is now, Pancho.
FB7FA549     //  Half the wedding costs. Call it fifteen grand. 
7D300D4D     //  I'm not paying shit! SHE called it off! Not me!
BC292E05     //  Hey, pay your debt like a man.
562B9102     //  You threatening me? Fuck off!
265468B1     //  This is beautiful. Wish I had the wedding photographer here. 
F20E05E1     //  That's fifteen K to Neil. And another five to me. Capisce?
C86F184A     //  (Groans)
DBEE02EE     //  I'll take that as a yes. First installment due tomorrow. Ten thousand.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
C659AB13     //  I got the address for the chop shop. Let's go!
76D1BE1B     //  Go to the body shop now?
A601C25C     //  A.J? Cool it. Kinda busy. 
492D2DCA     //  Hey, this is my fuckin' life we're talking about!
A5576631     //  Hello, Doc. Who's your friend?
D19B3CD4     //  My ride home. I'm giving you my pink slip.
04ECB005     //  It's not a gift, it's a payment.
F7F93A45     //  Whatever.
CED5ACB9     //  ... And asking for another favor at the same time.
ECC2CB71     //  I'll wait downstairs.
32F8E3A0     //  I need a second loan.
1C983B82     //  I already got your car, you loser. What's your collateral now? 
4C236A53     //  I'm a doctor, for chrissakes! I just have a short-term, cash flow problem.
5E93C7FF     //  Like I fucking care. The rate goes up, of course. 
1B08430C     //  Shit. All right, fine.
2CC3B4DC     //  Give me a higher rate, and we have a deal.
D2A5FBC9     //  You can't get blood from a turnip, Joey.
CD71D568     //  Then leave me alone, all right?
A213C9E0     //  Maybe we can work something out. Slightly higher rate, of course. 
DA63549F     //  Higher rate? Sure... fine.
0A9D470C     //  As long you don't mind a slightly higher rate of return.
BE862CA6     //  You're killin' me, Joey.
3F0D2923     //  Hey, you got no choice. I'm the only bank you got, you pathetic fuck. 
0197842E     //  Fine, sorry. I'll take it.
2F2B76C5     //  Deal seems fair to me.
D44DC979     //  Well, it seems like usury to me. Forget it.
CCC490F6     //  Hey, it's your choice, pops. 
0757D6E4     //  I'll see what Angie Buscetta can offer.
7A1A95D4     //  Get the fuck out. 
6C876A34     //  I'm sure we can work something out.
98F7E933     //  God, am I glad to hear that. Same rate?
6BB98AFC     //  Of course. You just paid me with a CAR. 
EE9FAA53     //  I'm all out of cars.
18699B8F     //  All the more reason to jack up the vig.
8BC846D7     //  Fine, jack away!
F896E566     //  Sorry, it's gotta be a tad higher.
C6972AFA     //  I can't afford it, Joey. Thanks anyway. 
572131CD     //  Come on, Doc. More risk, greater return.
901AABC0     //  Which means a higher rate?
AD3DD7F5     //  What do you think, Einstein?
19098316     //  Fine. 
BD0A7695     //  Nice doing business, Doc.
3A23922E     //  Wish I could say the same.
A22BC055     //  Joey, you've gotten too cocky for this business.
B3A3CB6F     //  And you've gotten too gutless, old man.
0ACF2E85     //  Looks like you could use a little R & R, Joey.
243A8CE1     //  Cool. A free dance?
F7C88603     //  No, but I'll give you a discount.
3207AEC6     //  You're a fuckin' doll.
AE0DF93F     //  I know.
5730F17E     //  Follow me darling.
F877809B     //  Maybe in a bit.
138A01E5     //  Anytime you want. I'm here to serve.
6761D07D     //  Look who's back. You want to play now?
712F116E     //  Fucking A. Let's do this.
A0A14745     //  Let the fun begin.
E4DEC493     //  Upstairs. It's private.
DC47CD44     //  Sorry babe, no time.
67442B40     //  You want another one Joe?
81539185     //  What do you think?
67C3B9CA     //  Why stop now?
24751B14     //  No, I gotta pace myself.
D0ED7548     //  Nice to see ya' cutie.
BC93BBB6     //  How ya been, Jazz?
6BB772F2     //  Fine. I'd be better if I could dance for a good looking guy though.
414623DA     //  Wonder if I can help with that?
4038D4E3     //  I think you got a shot.
5F056276     //  Let's go upstairs, and find out.
644C1F65     //  Maybe I'll help you later.

A39541E4     //  Yea. I could use it.
408C342B     //  Here, lemme take care of you.
8CEB6803     //  Come with me sweetie.
F48590EE     //  I would. But I can't right now.
FB8946FB     //  You still wanna party?
2C6AA873     //  I never said to stop in the first place.
21F49B5C     //  That's my boy.
52C71B06     //  That's all I got time for Jazz.
19654569     //  That rave last night... didn't I see you?
A5DE440F     //  I stay away from those things. 
F1BE8002     //  Whatever you say, Joey. Want a dance?
C5DCC5AB     //  Sure, if you insist.
8A3FA700     //  That's my job, honey.
D3067169     //  Come upstairs then.
22DCB01C     //  How 'bout later?
4F6F7D83     //  Whenever you want.
0525FC53     //  You want a dance Joey?
FAAEA543     //  Sure, Jazz, the full treatment.
8B6A643D     //  Thought you'd never ask.
475B92EB     //  Let's go somewhere more private.
838CCB84     //  Can't do it Jazz. Maybe later.
D9EA91AB     //  You want me to keep going?
81539185     //  What do you think?
F13007DC     //  Just checkin'.
9E11D861     //  Yea I do, but I gotta get going.
ABF5BDBD     //  Just when I was getting warmed up too.
F8CD25F6     //  I hear you're seeing someone, Joey.
9D3C7F6C     //  Word travels fast around here.
4F895985     //  Just keep her happy, okay?
E4AC232A     //  That's the general idea. 
8C925CAC     //  Unique, everything all right?
608E7F3F     //  Sure, Joey, I'm good. 
5FACDE2A     //  I was hoping you'd stop by.
6493186E     //  What for?
7B50AA77     //  Cause I want to party with you. Interested?
DFE7713A     //  I could be convinced.
C46C13E3     //  Right this way, stud boy.
14167ED4     //  Very interested, but I can't right now.
A85283F3     //  Then find me when you're free.
0459C5FB     //  Just tell me what you want, good-looking.
B4072829     //  I want you. Now.
76F002EC     //  Well, damn, here I am.
F27A52D5     //  I wish to hell that I could, but I can't.
0F9BE6C3     //  Just say the word and I'm there.
86BC313E     //  You want another?
82C7B42D     //  Keep 'em coming.
7E379AE0     //  Until you say stop. 
EFA9B8CB     //  I want ten more, but I gotta split.
514FBF9E     //  When're you gonna get a dance from me, huh?
BC9E51BD     //  Whenever you want I guess.
8EB7CB6C     //  How 'bout now?
8BC37C44     //  You talked me into it hot stuff.
9838E7D9     //  Good. I've missed you baby.
1C313BA3     //  I'm busy. Next time sweetheart - I promise.
16FA0EB5     //  That's what you always say.
28D79FAB     //  Can you handle a dance from me yet?
428A9F9F     //  I'll do my best to hold on.
DC47CD44     //  Sorry babe, no time.
3C67542C     //  Let me give you another one - please Joey?
340BA1DC     //  You talked me into it.
1FB11786     //  I'd stay all day if I could, but I got shit to do.
A65B795D     //  Where's your friend Reggie? He's a great tipper.
82F1C39D     //  Why would I know?! I'm not his fuckin' goomah.
F6526544     //  What'd I say? I'm sorry. You want a dance?
DEFA3885     //  Sure, if you forget about Reggie.
79F08479     //  Anything you want baby.
B0E1E952     //  No, I'm not in the mood
3966CEEB     //  How about now, Joey? You want a dance?
653D048B     //  Maybe I oughta.
F1F0354F     //  It's very therapeutic.
7DE65D21     //  I'm fine, get back to work.
AC4DCCE5     //  Tell me you want another.
38C74A25     //  I want another.
7D3FE16A     //  I was hoping you'd say that.
DAFEB665     //  When I do, I will.
9FD606D0     //  It was good, wasn't it? I can do better.
0CF64DBF     //  Your friend Neil is seriously fucked up.
C959AB28     //  Major drug casualty.
172BCE78     //  Can't get it up, poor baby. Want a ride?
2B428292     //  Probably shouldn't, but why not?
31AFB8B1     //  Then sit down and hold on.
228516B8     //  Thanks, but no thanks.
C25A0199     //  Tell me what you want, baby.
E1D3FD79     //  You still available?
7A4E231C     //  Let me check my date book.
7C01BC4E     //  Just saying hello.
D9684D98     //  Well, you definitely don't have Neil's problem. Wanna go again?
0654B55D     //  You noticed, huh?
7FC7FE21     //  Is it really true about your toes?
2868289A     //  God damn Neil!
41AE3841     //  Shit. Forgot. Wallet's a little light.
60AF6024     //  You want in? Pull up a chair.
4E65AFA6     //  Thanks T. Maybe later.
09146068     //  I'd love to.
11F4A4F8     //  Well, we need a new patsy...
E5171C80     //  I got some time to kill. Anyone up for a game?
E3CA0A8A     //  Hey, pal Joey! How's it going? 
6A79D8BC     //  Can't complain.
1C170A97     //  Listen, Nicky - you gotta mix it up a little. The girls are getting pissy.
E7AC1421     //  So what's new? Tell 'em to fuck off, I don't take no requests, all right?
722EB198     //  C'mon, man, they're bustin' my balls down there.
8E756B19     //  Silvio said I could play what I want. That's what I'm doing.
43F2F313     //  Nicky, I know Sil's your cousin, but you're fucking killin' me down there.
B663D160     //  As a favor to you then. Just this once. 
6459E8B5     //  I know Sil's your cousin, but cut me a little slack.
5335BC23     //  Sorry, Joey, no can do. I'm sick of their bitchin'.
654D995E     //  Nick, you're fuckin' up Sil's business. You hear me, fuckhead?
FF030CEF     //  All right, fine. Here.
143B325D     //  Can you just change it?
86ED9777     //  And if I don't? Silvio said to play whatever I want.
0E54676F     //  Let's ask cousin Sil what he prefers.
9CD2C7E7     //  Jesus Joey, I was just kiddin', all right? Here you go.
7DEAA989     //  Nicky, wake up - the girls still have to dance to it.
FD7470EA     //  I'm fucking tired of getting ragged on.
28E6EF59     //  I ain't changing it.
2817DBEE     //  Every time it's a fight with you. Fucking change it - now!
154B4A86     //  Fine, whatever. This is such bullshit. Here.
F123FD6B     //  Then consider it an order, asswipe. Change it!
D6FF99A8     //  Fuck that! Silvio says I can play what I want.
E34EB0AE     //  I know Silvio's your cousin, but you gotta keep the ladies happy.
088AEBF6     //  I am so fucking tired of hearing them bitch and moan. 
D11CFF8F     //  Can you just humor them a little? 
77B5B184     //  No! The slits are getting ridiculous. The music stays.
72F3EBE8     //  Your loving cousin also said I could break your fuckin' head.
B71888CA     //  Well, Sil is gonna fuckin' hear about this, I guaran-fuckin-tee you. Here...
A9170970     //  Okay, maybe this will shut them up. 
6F595EA6     //  Go piss on somebody else, okay?
61904730     //  Don't tell me you're here again about the music. 
CC0F92A2     //  I'm here about the music. Play something new, Nicky , and stop giving me shit.
1FDF07C8     //  Who's the fuckin' DJ here, you or me?
120FBBD6     //  Hey, fuckhead, it'll be hard to spin those records with broken thumbs, right?
CAEE1E3E     //  Send one of the bimbos up. She can pick a whole set.
D53B411F     //  Just change the music. What's the problem?
D395E0EB     //  Unless it comes from Sil, I ain't changing shit.
0B686A8E     //  You are. But the clientele wanna hear something different.
4AB9C055     //  What clientele? I ain't heard no one complainin'.
5BD8BD1F     //  I'm giving you the fuckin' order. Change the fuckin' music!
14D71F0B     //  Ok, ok, sure, chill out. Try this.
8630D8BD     //  I'm just trying to keep everyone happy.
433889FF     //  I'm not changing shit unless Silvio gives me the word.
4C09043D     //  People at the bar, the girls... They make the money, remember? Keep 'em happy.
5B115A9D     //  Only if Sil gives the order. 
ADE14513     //  Does Silvio know you grope the merchandise during business hours?
6B04176C     //  Calm down, I'll change the music, all right?
EADC4E39     //  Sorry. No groping. They're tired of getting groped.
E947525E     //  I'm just having fun! You want new music? Fine. 
3BBE5A52     //  They're working their butts off, same as you. Now how bout it?
A3DF57BB     //  Sure thing Joey. Here you go.
2B3A6A68     //  I appreciate it.
88F27CF6     //  Go away, asshole.
9ED74D0B     //  You again? What is it this time?
20C6AF8A     //  Just play something different. And no crap!
07610F90     //  Lemme guess. Different music, right?
182DFEA2     //  Fucking mind reader here.
66172FE0     //  Not that big a mind to read.
40DE60C6     //  Can we get something different on?
68123A8E     //  Come on Joey, you serious?
FB8AF938     //  Don't fuck with me. Change it.
8E174BB1     //  Ok, what did you wanna hear?
6A347F52     //  Surprise me.
7DA1E6F7     //  Look who's fuckin' back.
10BCA174     //  I'm not in the mood, asshole. Just change it.
654BB9FC     //  Sure, no prob.
C719D9F7     //  Play something else?
B8899175     //  You read my mind.
4F65737F     //  Tony's like your uncle or something, right? Sorry about before.
8C463214     //  Forget about it.
6F466185     //  Want me to mix it up a little?
6DF09456     //  Yeah, do that.
C0D6F937     //  Can we change the channel?
1F1D53D7     //  Hey, I'm all over it, boss.
A6166CB1     //  What's up, Joey?
2A774B28     //  Same request, different music.
AD8C3754     //  You got it.
AE4EA9FF     //  Forget hockey. It's idiotic. Bunch of thugs.
80BF81D8     //  Baseball, my friend, is a game for intellectuals.
192D9EE7     //  Then why do you like it?
3E201308     //  Ho! Watch your fucking mouth!
6C75DE0C     //  Hey Paulie, here's this week.
76925F28     //  Not bad, junior.
E1FA79B0     //  Anytime you're ready to express your gratitude, the envelope's always waiting.
FA9869D0     //  Understood. You need anything else?
1ED2C0AC     //  I'm taking my ma to Fernando's For Hair. 
7E739477     //  Check in with T. He's in the office.
525C1196     //  See, this one shows a little respect. 
8F18D284     //  Like he's got a choice. He works for you.
794C4A21     //  Generosity, my friend, is a virtue not an obligation. 
9C35C8CA     //  That's bullshit, Paulie!
48267576     //  A $25,000 watch! That's kinda hard to miss.
BD01EC71     //  Fuckin Reggie...
03D9B614     //  Never wear a dead man's watch, 'specially if you whacked the guy.
4D00AAEF     //  Paulie's gonna be pissed.
7A269BAD     //  I gotta tell him?
94FB2506     //  Better you than someone else.
C2DFFA82     //  Is he sober this time?
E44DBA1A     //  Only cause he just got here.
95BD8B5E     //  He's in the lounge next door.
69469788     //  Then go lean on him. Take Joey.
62AE120F     //  Like I need him? We're not talking about a left guard, T.
53E7B771     //  After you're done, we'll finish our conversation.
7A4E0464     //  The guy kicks field goals, Tony.
FE5AD58E     //  He doesn't even wear pads!
832175D1     //  Joey, you gotta help me.
6688AA91     //  This is my fuckin' dad! I can only bullshit him so long.
6732FDA2     //  I got a line on a chop shop in Newark, Do-Right Auto Repair.
5F72842F     //  Couldn't find no address.
C45E5997     //  Did you look on the internet?
07656CFF     //  A.J. Maybe you oughta just tell Tony.
D97FC175     //  Come clean, you know.
457AB1CA     //  Hold the phone. I'll find the address.
691D1D98     //  A.J.'s a nice kid, but he ain't the one who's gonna get hurt.
7E83F7CB     //  You want me to tell Tony? That's bullshit. I ain't a rat.

6D6E819B     //  I'm keepin' my word with A.J.
889E7D08     //  Then find that chop shop.
576FFB72     //  Paulie knows that business. Ask him.

452D49F4     //  They suck.
76822E8E     //  People really want 'em.
2265D1A8     //  Okay, I'll steal one. Test the "previously owned" market.

60B28FBF     //  You mind keeping it down a bit?

C18054F8     //  Frank, Tommy - howya doin'?
197F7898     //  I was hopin' to make a killing, but New York didn't make the playoffs.

B5E192F3     //  No way, fagola.
10B427CB     //  I've caught my thing with the thing!
15DED26C     //  Painful, no doubt, but not my problem.
ECF42ED9     //  Do you know where Unique is?
64A7439E     //  Probably in back. Who's asking?
2018D228     //  She's supposed to give me a dance. I have an appointment.

0822D340     //  Careful. Around here, the customer ain't always right.
E0A6FAE1     //  Sherri, you know you can't work the Bing.
F79E9D78     //  We're just having drinks, Joey. Is that a crime?
74D9DEA1     //  When Sil catches you, could be assault and battery. 
B9B399D3     //  I hear you're chasing a new tail. She hot?

E6FD1400     //  You're gonna go see Tony, right?
D42A7F46     //  Absolutely. Just had to pick up a car.
62908A38     //  Hey, Tony...You want anything from the deli? Paulie's hungry.
EC15FA7C     //  Which must mean you're buying. Get me the salami on rye, lettuce, mayo, mustard.
4C4F1B7A     //  Eh... chicken soup with rice. Lotsa pickles.
9C368A89     //  Cheeseburger and a vanilla shake.
ABB9F6EA     //  If it's chocolate, you're fuckin' takin' it back, got it?
7B048344     //  Neil?
3DDF18D2     //  No thanks, I'm off to AC, then I'm dropping by the bachelor party.
46A00F17     //  You're gonna spy on your future son-in-law, and then tell your daughter?
50C6EE72     //  He can look, but not touch. Those are the rules. 
2D3E7D5F     //  Hey, you're a defense attorney, counselor, not a prosecutor.
6BFED4E2     //  I feel sorry for the fuckin' kid, marrying into the Perry Mason family.
93516DDE     //  How's Paulie's little meeting going out there?
130B2A30     //  The guy's a fuckin' moron, if you ask me.
CA4AA734     //  Considering his family, not a big surprise. 
82B0BB50     //  The guy called Paulie, you know, stupid.
B15F75E1     //  Ho! And he thinks he's gonna make a fuckin' deal?
6E1BF9DE     //  Looks a little intense. 
CA89030C     //  Fucking Philly cheesesteaks. Every time they gotta whip it out.
ACBC1415     //  Who is he?
8D5035F8     //  Hey, if you needed to know, you'd already know, Junior G-Man.
57EB44B6     //  Sil told me 'bout that drunk outside. Nice work.
FD6F1E83     //  Thanks Uncle T.
67B9B255     //  Hey, I don't care how many times you hung out with Tony's kids. You still ain't a blood relative. 
C219CEA7     //  Chrissy's on the rag. Neil cleaned him out. I'm just picking the bones.
C6290946     //  Did you see Vito yet? He's in the lounge. The man might be hungry.
86908B55     //  I heard you ran into a little trouble at the casino the other night.
110AC9A2     //  Just a couple of assholes from high school. 
E1A8C2E4     //  Yeah, that shit never ends.
42F78F47     //  It was no big deal.
02EE5A69     //  Good, glad to hear it.
C0DFB74F     //  Wasn't my fault, Tone.
9CD899FA     //  Neil's son-in-law is a real piece of work, huh?
F471C408     //  Didn't mean to cause trouble, T.
E374B4C7     //  Uh, guys your age, you need to... sow wild oats, so to speak. Don't worry about it.
CAF5B887     //  Joey. Debbie's dancing for some creep next door.
B8EC1E7C     //  Take a look, would you?
64B47B47     //  Sure thing, Sil.
6060EA55     //  Tony, you need anything?
0A70EEAB     //  Go check out that girl Debbie, like Sil asked. You like her, right?
0DCD9DEA     //  We get along, yeah.
07BF34EE     //  You two ever... 
B7571A9C     //  Debbie? Not that kind. Now Jasmine, she's a different story.
8BADB9D3     //  Careful there. A bit of a revolving door, I hear. 
EAC30D30     //  Fuck! Mikey told me the same thing.
64133E9A     //  Joey! Go! Debbie, now.
CB38D6F3     //  Everything good next door?
A6969E3F     //  It is now.
1AF56EBF     //  Get out there kid. Chrissy's waitin'.
558E4266     //  In the lounge. Go, go!
28E7A8CA     //  You talk to that kicker?
A6B2FD78     //  He won't be kickin' right on Sunday.
89A714FC     //  It's covered, Tone. He's cooperating.
D35745E4     //  So, as I was saying... you're startin' to impress me, kid. 
3FC136C8     //  I've been ridin' his ass, T.
DCB1326C     //  There's a party at Vesuvio's next week. Hesh's nephew's Bar Mitzvah.
A4B93E50     //  Everyone's coming, including you
E16F00B7     //  Hey, Tone, thanks. Should I bring a gift?
C3A302E9     //  Fifty bucks in an envelope. Kids that age, all they want is cash.
59CF4FAF     //  Bring fifty-four. It's a sacred number. Some Jewish ka-blah-blah shit.
2D3BD229     //  Go to the Bar Mitzvah now?
A5C21FB3     //  Uh, excuse me, Tone. You seen Paulie?
95F38F16     //  Try in back.
CFFF8223     //  What now?
7BB9AE8A     //  Excuse me, this is a private conversation.
3AA992B8     //  Closing time already. I'm gonna check the take.
DAAF2343     //  I talked with A.J. after we got home.
DAD237EE     //  He says you saved his life and the whole mess was his, not yours.
CD9F85FD     //  We were in it together. I'm sorry, Tony. I shoulda come right to you. 
8CA85BE8     //  He says he asked you not to, and that you were keeping your word and not rattin' him out. If I wasn't pissed off, I'd be impressed. 
00D13C89     //  I won't fuck up again, Tony, I swear.
D43B8AE4     //  Well, you ain't gonna get the chance for a long time. 
86FB8124     //  You got something to say now?
91B0B453     //  Excuse me, T. It's important.
0F2851A9     //  Jesus Christ, Sil. I'm in a meeting!
DAEB30A8     //  Tony! He's gone.
54675691     //  Guess the meetin's over.
B873E3AC     //  Oh yeah. Angelo just returned your car. 
F61BB0FD     //  You got a big heart, Tone. Putting Big Pussy's bastard kid on the payroll.
AD0C15AE     //  My mother raised me. I didn't have shit to do with my old man.
FDC69228     //  I wasn't talking to you. Was I?
67E8499D     //  Hey, I'm standing right here!
1668047B     //  And you can thank Tony for that. Your old man was a rat, like it or not.
1E4167D7     //  Sorry to tell you kid. Chris ain't wrong.
EBC48049     //  Good point. 
CA90E5BC     //  Then keep your mouth shut. It ain't my fault your old man was a rat.
7E364385     //  Bring it down a notch, will ya?
3E6D9E75     //  I know, but you're talking about me.
B4990D96     //  You're old man was a rat. That's what I know.
A4BB2F6E     //  Let him be, Christopher.
C93C27F1     //  If I want advice, I'll ask someone else.
9BE90CC2     //  Looks like you oughta.
EBC8DC97     //  He's got you there, Chrissy
7CF8B7EE     //  You're supposed to see T, remember?
32923F4A     //  I'm all over it.
C345FAEC     //  You gonna be free later? I might need something.
AC631BCB     //  That's up to Paulie.
D1CE7AE5     //  What a wimp dick.
59BAC757     //  Hey, LaRocca, over here. Chop chop.
1124C50D     //  I gotta go. Thanks, Joey, you're a sweetheart.
CDBDD06C     //  I gotta make a collection. This punk who runs the gym's been holding back. You're coming with me.
1CB15B5E     //  I work for Paulie!
90EF28C4     //  Then he better not find out, right?
78914120     //  This is bullshit, Chris. He's a captain!
069B5E6F     //  And so am I. What are you gonna do? Tell the principal?
B861D809     //  Fuck.
4840CCB3     //  Go to the Gym with Chris now?
CB77DCE1     //  Is Paulie around?
4EA4209A     //  If he knows about Saul, it's coming our of your pocket, jerkoff. 
21AEAFA4     //  I got it. You seen him?
0F155D72     //  What am I, your fuckin' advance man?
6348FEB7     //  Remember. Paulie finds out about Saul, you're payin'.
EA64CD28     //  I got it, Chris.
A12719C2     //  For the fifteenth fucking time.
F52BEC88     //  Get the fuck out.
2D817CFD     //  Chris, I'm sorry.
711610D2     //  The shit doctors do now? Who knows, maybe he still suits up.
113BBFCC     //  All right, stop! Stop! I'll miss a few kicks!
A30A85CF     //  A few?
7D873453     //  I'll throw the game! Whatever it takes!
65C1E7B8     //  All right, LaRocca, I got it from here.
E40B70C4     //  Hey, junior, Tony's looking for you.
321670D0     //  You and Tony's kid still "pals"? I fucking doubt it. 
314E6BA0     //  You still call Tony "Uncle T"? Bet he loves that shit. 
9AA7A303     //  Vito, I'm ordering take out-
5A37CFBA     //  Hey! My friend was talking to one of the strippers. I hear you fuckin' threw him out!
865A72C2     //  Yeah, then I beat his ass.
D022C14E     //  He pinched Jasmine. 
AB6F14E5     //  You fuckin' dick!
AAC6B3C2     //  Whoa! 
9658DBFB     //  I hurt your friend pretty bad. You wanna be next?
4465C6C0     //  You tell him Joey.
53B2685F     //  Get out of here, Jazz. This ain't something a lady should see.
A00A74D3     //  You want me to act all scared? Well fuck you, I ain't scared!
9BD98D6B     //  Hey, don't keep a captain waiting, kid.
4BCD6054     //  If I was Paulie, you'd be countin' your balls. 
C3F5FFB5     //  Hey, Joey? All these fine women here. How come you don't have a girlfriend?
5E39B898     //  I like to spread the wealth.
A840AB47     //  Thanks for dealing with that jerk, Joey. Can I give you a dance?
8EF5FD83     //  Hey, hey! There's a seniority system here.
79BF4FD8     //  Sorry Vito. I'll catch you later, Joey. 
43EA751A     //  Not bad, rookie. 
AC6885EA     //  Thanks Vito. So like I was saying before douchebag number two interrupted. I'm getting take-out. You want something?
D6FCC4A4     //  Lo-fat turkey, no bread, no mayo, no potato salad, just meat and a pickle.
C939C9FD     //  Paulie was just looking for you. Out front.
122ADA56     //  Heard some banging through the wall. That creep give you trouble?
BD8A080A     //  He was a fucking loser. Nothing to it.
4810928B     //  No cards for you, kid.
994F4332     //  Paulie says he's doing good. Let him lose some money.
CACF4105     //  Leave story mode and play poker?
6B8CBEEE     //  Thanks Uncle T. Maybe later.
7D898CAE     //  Thanks, I'll try not to embarrass you. 
0C6F6E42     //  Get Neil in on this. He's a born loser.
EB52AFB9     //  Hey, kid, Tony says go see him.
4D06EE3E     //  Next time I'm in the hospital, don't come visit. Send cash. 
FECC6C43     //  Look out, here comes Dr. Death.
54A6CACE     //  Joey. Did my future son-in-law do any of those skags at the Nighthorse?
2B48A79E     //  Why don't you ask him.
13FD357F     //  That's your answer?!
ABCA9215     //  Kevin's in deep shit. Jeannie knows he banged that hooker. 
B35CE621     //  Hey, I didn't tell nobody!
9D438899     //  My wife says a rash did him in. 
107DC310     //  Now the fucking wedding's in jeopardy.
B54D1287     //  Maybe you can get a refund.
CDCE2D3D     //  I oughta sue you, kid. My balls swole up like grapefruits.
5BA9EA2A     //  You lost your rug, Neil.
EC9522D5     //  So, am I okay with Tony now?
BDA40A71     //  Ask him yourself. I ain't your rabbi.
341DBCDA     //  Let's have a toot and bury the hatchet.
AB3D2E43     //  No, thanks.
69A11710     //  Hey, does blow make you impotent?
70A59407     //  E.D. A national fucking tragedy.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
43E25E20     //  Joey, it's Trishelle.
27A862DE     //  I gotta work late.
774DCAA1     //  Can we try again?
0AA3325C     //  Relax, it happens. What do you do, anyway?
DD7E20D9     //  Just boring internet stuff. I'll tell you when we go out, okay?
59CDE4A9     //  Call me. 
EBB318BF     //  Some drunk pinched Jasmine's ass.
619413CD     //  What's wrong? Paulie askin' for me?
3E5D1348     //  No, not that I've heard.
245A06F4     //  I know you're busy, Joey, but that loser upstairs won't change the music. 
1FAA2AE0     //  Could you talk to him?
E20F0508     //  For you, gorgeous? Any time.
F4905807     //  You aren't gonna help? I thought you were my friend.
9C8FD31F     //  I hate this D.J.
755A5945     //  Now this I can dance to. Wanna watch?
05C282A9     //  You know I usually charge big time for this.
7CA277BE     //  Hey, I'm happy to pay, beautiful.
18084AEB     //  Your mother raised you right, Joey. But this one's on me.
B51EAE74     //  He's a prick, but he's also Sil's cousin.
660179A3     //  My hands are tied. 
C0E97EDB     //  Tell me about it. I guess I'll have to let him diddle my tits.
F9189E78     //  Works every time. 
2728647E     //  Thanks again for the music, sweetie.
8B589144     //  I should be thanking you. That was fucking hot.
D13A367E     //  Nice work on the music.
A7B84CCF     //  Had to comp that asshole a special dance of love. 
13BD5BE3     //  Did Silvio find you?
1BB39174     //  Where is he?
7CB7CBA6     //  He was here a minute ago.
D8D1AEE5     //  You need a girlfriend, Joey.
04D653C3     //  I'm puttin' that on my To-Do list.
22F446B9     //  I hate working days. The tips suck.
C3542F9A     //  I'm working, Joey.
B79DA0E8     //  Must have been the music.
B444019B     //  Don't you have nothing to do today?
9F6E2E80     //  I'm talkin' to you, ain't I?
14EF1FCE     //  Go get laid, Joey.
9B3F8E82     //  How you doing, Joey?
B76D2E99     //  Been better.
40F9789E     //  I have a surefire remedy.
8B6A643D     //  Thought you'd never ask.
408C342B     //  Here, lemme take care of you.
8CEB6803     //  Come with me sweetie.
045E8AB4     //  No, not now.
99492C89     //  Then maybe later, huh?
EA7532A2     //  Ready for that dance?
FCD60D98     //  Should've said yes the first time.
D463C434     //  Come here honey.
62D8508F     //  Let's go upstairs.
59E17559     //  No, but don't take it personally
4978364B     //  You wanna keep going?
7582CB66     //  Abso-fucking-lutely.
AFFE86D3     //  I'm good.
89934F15     //  How you doing girl?
2273B528     //  Feeling better already. Want a dance?
2A3A881B     //  Sure, why not. You got time?
FEB40BDB     //  Are you kidding? For you?
393035E6     //  Thanks, but not right now.
BB964B24     //  You know where to find me.
3F377E3E     //  You got time for a dance yet?
271E420E     //  What the hell. Show me what ya' got.
1502141B     //  I got a lot Joey. Don't you know that?
0CF612E9     //  Answer's still no.
8378D450     //  Just asking.
0AC60E53     //  Can you stay a while baby?
9C61736B     //  I ain't going nowhere.
890D4A3A     //  Good, cause I'm not done with you yet.
62D96324     //  Not today.
EAC476BD     //  Don't usually see you sitting down.
CB5D2F99     //  Closing time, honey. Did Trishelle call?
4FBDC920     //  Not yet.
5253EA17     //  I'm going home soon, but if there's anything I can do, you call me.
C8D0DA9E     //  These heels are killing me.
8DCDA1F5     //  You're done dancing, take them off!
7712D5EA     //  And walk barefoot. In here? I could get leprosy...
862382F1     //  Reggie? What are you doing here? 
7993F26F     //  Thought I'd say hello... Find out if you talked to Paulie, you know, about me.
60611889     //  This ain't a club, Reg. They don't need new members.
AD6B36F4     //  Hey, Joey!
F906873E     //  Better see what he wants.
A90A01CE     //  What'd Paulie want?
127AC1B7     //  A fucking snack.
C8A58537     //  That's it?
6053115F     //  Listen, there's this party tonight...
3B5997E7     //  I'm working Reggie. Get the picture?
8A52906D     //  Paulie wants you. Said to go see him right now.
ADE9E7D1     //  Probably wants corned beef now. Where is he?
663CF967     //  In the can, along with his business associate.
61E18A59     //  Come on, hustle! He'll think I didn't tell you!
5970163A     //  Joey, he said now. The head.
5C62EA22     //  Can I do anything?
339B7C93     //  Stand here and look stupid. That shouldn't be a stretch. 
3102B785     //  You're making enemies left and right. Louis the Bat is a vengeful bastard. 
D62E67D7     //  Oh yeah?
AF5B1327     //  Yeah, you shoulda killed him when you had a chance.
ED33F948     //  No blood, that was the order.
FA2B89E2     //  And now you're in a war.
B358BC45     //  How you doing Debbie?
33240C7C     //  She's busy.
C3542F9A     //  I'm working, Joey.
35A80EAC     //  I didn't say you were done.
8861649D     //  You bought half an hour. You want more, pay more.
CEA9D291     //  Time's up, mister. You heard the lady.
98CBADEA     //  "Lady?" This skank?
01F04BE2     //  The room's closed, folks. Do your drinking up front.
C258A85B     //  What's going on?
FEB079CF     //  You're running quite a tab at the Nighthorse. We'd like to cover it for you. 
B508B522     //  I don't need your help.
3527DF10     //  Yes, you do. Now if you start missing kicks, bingo, your debt disappears. 
2E902A9B     //  Otherwise say hello to the injured list.
33258445     //  Hey! Fuck you.
9A95BD19     //  Let's get out of here, Chad.
B3CEC414     //  No broken bones, Joey. We need this guy healthy next Sunday.
F0E07487     //  Everything cool, Unique?
0FF1E9B4     //  Why wouldn't it be?
FED780DE     //  Joey, ya hear? I'm a free man again.
E6F2BDA2     //  You're really keeping her busy, Kev.
12F2CC70     //  I'm celebrating my freedom, dude.
80586752     //  Take a break, Deb.
EF8EA42A     //  Joey, what are you doing?
4D2A9054     //  So Jeannie called off the wedding.
8B560EDB     //  Can you believe that bitch? So I got a little pre-nuptial pussy. It was my bachelor party!
68FF55D4     //  Well, you fucked up, junior. You broke her heart and even worse, her father owes me money.
57C96816     //  Like that's my problem?
4F671302     //  It is now, Pancho.
FB7FA549     //  Half the wedding costs. Call it fifteen grand. 
7D300D4D     //  I'm not paying shit! SHE called it off! Not me!
BC292E05     //  Hey, pay your debt like a man.
562B9102     //  You threatening me? Fuck off!
265468B1     //  This is beautiful. Wish I had the wedding photographer here. 
F20E05E1     //  That's fifteen K to Neil. And another five to me. Capisce?
C86F184A     //  (Groans)
DBEE02EE     //  I'll take that as a yes. First installment due tomorrow. Ten thousand.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
C659AB13     //  I got the address for the chop shop. Let's go!
76D1BE1B     //  Go to the body shop now?
A601C25C     //  A.J? Cool it. Kinda busy. 
492D2DCA     //  Hey, this is my fuckin' life we're talking about!
A5576631     //  Hello, Doc. Who's your friend?
D19B3CD4     //  My ride home. I'm giving you my pink slip.
04ECB005     //  It's not a gift, it's a payment.
F7F93A45     //  Whatever.
CED5ACB9     //  ... And asking for another favor at the same time.
ECC2CB71     //  I'll wait downstairs.
32F8E3A0     //  I need a second loan.
1C983B82     //  I already got your car, you loser. What's your collateral now? 
4C236A53     //  I'm a doctor, for chrissakes! I just have a short-term, cash flow problem.
5E93C7FF     //  Like I fucking care. The rate goes up, of course. 
1B08430C     //  Shit. All right, fine.
2CC3B4DC     //  Give me a higher rate, and we have a deal.
D2A5FBC9     //  You can't get blood from a turnip, Joey.
CD71D568     //  Then leave me alone, all right?
A213C9E0     //  Maybe we can work something out. Slightly higher rate, of course. 
DA63549F     //  Higher rate? Sure... fine.
0A9D470C     //  As long you don't mind a slightly higher rate of return.
BE862CA6     //  You're killin' me, Joey.
3F0D2923     //  Hey, you got no choice. I'm the only bank you got, you pathetic fuck. 
0197842E     //  Fine, sorry. I'll take it.
2F2B76C5     //  Deal seems fair to me.
D44DC979     //  Well, it seems like usury to me. Forget it.
CCC490F6     //  Hey, it's your choice, pops. 
0757D6E4     //  I'll see what Angie Buscetta can offer.
7A1A95D4     //  Get the fuck out. 
6C876A34     //  I'm sure we can work something out.
98F7E933     //  God, am I glad to hear that. Same rate?
6BB98AFC     //  Of course. You just paid me with a CAR. 
EE9FAA53     //  I'm all out of cars.
18699B8F     //  All the more reason to jack up the vig.
8BC846D7     //  Fine, jack away!
F896E566     //  Sorry, it's gotta be a tad higher.
C6972AFA     //  I can't afford it, Joey. Thanks anyway. 
572131CD     //  Come on, Doc. More risk, greater return.
901AABC0     //  Which means a higher rate?
AD3DD7F5     //  What do you think, Einstein?
19098316     //  Fine. 
BD0A7695     //  Nice doing business, Doc.
3A23922E     //  Wish I could say the same.
A22BC055     //  Joey, you've gotten too cocky for this business.
B3A3CB6F     //  And you've gotten too gutless, old man.
0ACF2E85     //  Looks like you could use a little R & R, Joey.
243A8CE1     //  Cool. A free dance?
F7C88603     //  No, but I'll give you a discount.
3207AEC6     //  You're a fuckin' doll.
AE0DF93F     //  I know.
5730F17E     //  Follow me darling.
F877809B     //  Maybe in a bit.
138A01E5     //  Anytime you want. I'm here to serve.
6761D07D     //  Look who's back. You want to play now?
712F116E     //  Fucking A. Let's do this.
A0A14745     //  Let the fun begin.
E4DEC493     //  Upstairs. It's private.
DC47CD44     //  Sorry babe, no time.
67442B40     //  You want another one Joe?
81539185     //  What do you think?
67C3B9CA     //  Why stop now?
24751B14     //  No, I gotta pace myself.
D0ED7548     //  Nice to see ya' cutie.
BC93BBB6     //  How ya been, Jazz?
6BB772F2     //  Fine. I'd be better if I could dance for a good looking guy though.
414623DA     //  Wonder if I can help with that?
4038D4E3     //  I think you got a shot.
5F056276     //  Let's go upstairs, and find out.
644C1F65     //  Maybe I'll help you later.
13A7ED31     //  I'm gonna hold ya to it.
68A309D3     //  You want some company Joey?
A39541E4     //  Yea. I could use it.
408C342B     //  Here, lemme take care of you.
8CEB6803     //  Come with me sweetie.
F48590EE     //  I would. But I can't right now.
FB8946FB     //  You still wanna party?
2C6AA873     //  I never said to stop in the first place.
21F49B5C     //  That's my boy.
52C71B06     //  That's all I got time for Jazz.
19654569     //  That rave last night... didn't I see you?
A5DE440F     //  I stay away from those things. 
F1BE8002     //  Whatever you say, Joey. Want a dance?
C5DCC5AB     //  Sure, if you insist.
8A3FA700     //  That's my job, honey.
D3067169     //  Come upstairs then.
22DCB01C     //  How 'bout later?
4F6F7D83     //  Whenever you want.
0525FC53     //  You want a dance Joey?
FAAEA543     //  Sure, Jazz, the full treatment.
8B6A643D     //  Thought you'd never ask.
475B92EB     //  Let's go somewhere more private.
838CCB84     //  Can't do it Jazz. Maybe later.
D9EA91AB     //  You want me to keep going?
81539185     //  What do you think?
F13007DC     //  Just checkin'.
9E11D861     //  Yea I do, but I gotta get going.
ABF5BDBD     //  Just when I was getting warmed up too.
F8CD25F6     //  I hear you're seeing someone, Joey.
9D3C7F6C     //  Word travels fast around here.
4F895985     //  Just keep her happy, okay?
E4AC232A     //  That's the general idea. 
8C925CAC     //  Unique, everything all right?
608E7F3F     //  Sure, Joey, I'm good. 
5FACDE2A     //  I was hoping you'd stop by.
6493186E     //  What for?
7B50AA77     //  Cause I want to party with you. Interested?
DFE7713A     //  I could be convinced.
C46C13E3     //  Right this way, stud boy.
14167ED4     //  Very interested, but I can't right now.
A85283F3     //  Then find me when you're free.
0459C5FB     //  Just tell me what you want, good-looking.
B4072829     //  I want you. Now.
76F002EC     //  Well, damn, here I am.
F27A52D5     //  I wish to hell that I could, but I can't.
0F9BE6C3     //  Just say the word and I'm there.
86BC313E     //  You want another?
82C7B42D     //  Keep 'em coming.
7E379AE0     //  Until you say stop. 
EFA9B8CB     //  I want ten more, but I gotta split.
514FBF9E     //  When're you gonna get a dance from me, huh?
BC9E51BD     //  Whenever you want I guess.
8EB7CB6C     //  How 'bout now?
8BC37C44     //  You talked me into it hot stuff.
9838E7D9     //  Good. I've missed you baby.
1C313BA3     //  I'm busy. Next time sweetheart - I promise.
16FA0EB5     //  That's what you always say.
28D79FAB     //  Can you handle a dance from me yet?
428A9F9F     //  I'll do my best to hold on.
DC47CD44     //  Sorry babe, no time.
3C67542C     //  Let me give you another one - please Joey?
340BA1DC     //  You talked me into it.
1FB11786     //  I'd stay all day if I could, but I got shit to do.
A65B795D     //  Where's your friend Reggie? He's a great tipper.
82F1C39D     //  Why would I know?! I'm not his fuckin' goomah.
F6526544     //  What'd I say? I'm sorry. You want a dance?
DEFA3885     //  Sure, if you forget about Reggie.
79F08479     //  Anything you want baby.
B0E1E952     //  No, I'm not in the mood
3966CEEB     //  How about now, Joey? You want a dance?
653D048B     //  Maybe I oughta.
F1F0354F     //  It's very therapeutic.
7DE65D21     //  I'm fine, get back to work.
AC4DCCE5     //  Tell me you want another.
38C74A25     //  I want another.
7D3FE16A     //  I was hoping you'd say that.
DAFEB665     //  When I do, I will.
9FD606D0     //  It was good, wasn't it? I can do better.
0CF64DBF     //  Your friend Neil is seriously fucked up.
C959AB28     //  Major drug casualty.
172BCE78     //  Can't get it up, poor baby. Want a ride?
2B428292     //  Probably shouldn't, but why not?
31AFB8B1     //  Then sit down and hold on.
228516B8     //  Thanks, but no thanks.
C25A0199     //  Tell me what you want, baby.
E1D3FD79     //  You still available?
7A4E231C     //  Let me check my date book.
7C01BC4E     //  Just saying hello.
D9684D98     //  Well, you definitely don't have Neil's problem. Wanna go again?
0654B55D     //  You noticed, huh?
7FC7FE21     //  Is it really true about your toes?
2868289A     //  God damn Neil!
41AE3841     //  Shit. Forgot. Wallet's a little light.
60AF6024     //  You want in? Pull up a chair.
4E65AFA6     //  Thanks T. Maybe later.
09146068     //  I'd love to.
11F4A4F8     //  Well, we need a new patsy...
E5171C80     //  I got some time to kill. Anyone up for a game?
E3CA0A8A     //  Hey, pal Joey! How's it going? 
6A79D8BC     //  Can't complain.
1C170A97     //  Listen, Nicky - you gotta mix it up a little. The girls are getting pissy.
E7AC1421     //  So what's new? Tell 'em to fuck off, I don't take no requests, all right?
722EB198     //  C'mon, man, they're bustin' my balls down there.
8E756B19     //  Silvio said I could play what I want. That's what I'm doing.
43F2F313     //  Nicky, I know Sil's your cousin, but you're fucking killin' me down there.
B663D160     //  As a favor to you then. Just this once. 
6459E8B5     //  I know Sil's your cousin, but cut me a little slack.
5335BC23     //  Sorry, Joey, no can do. I'm sick of their bitchin'.
654D995E     //  Nick, you're fuckin' up Sil's business. You hear me, fuckhead?
FF030CEF     //  All right, fine. Here.
143B325D     //  Can you just change it?
86ED9777     //  And if I don't? Silvio said to play whatever I want.
0E54676F     //  Let's ask cousin Sil what he prefers.
9CD2C7E7     //  Jesus Joey, I was just kiddin', all right? Here you go.
7DEAA989     //  Nicky, wake up - the girls still have to dance to it.
FD7470EA     //  I'm fucking tired of getting ragged on.
28E6EF59     //  I ain't changing it.
2817DBEE     //  Every time it's a fight with you. Fucking change it - now!
154B4A86     //  Fine, whatever. This is such bullshit. Here.
F123FD6B     //  Then consider it an order, asswipe. Change it!
D6FF99A8     //  Fuck that! Silvio says I can play what I want.
E34EB0AE     //  I know Silvio's your cousin, but you gotta keep the ladies happy.
088AEBF6     //  I am so fucking tired of hearing them bitch and moan. 
D11CFF8F     //  Can you just humor them a little? 
77B5B184     //  No! The slits are getting ridiculous. The music stays.
72F3EBE8     //  Your loving cousin also said I could break your fuckin' head.
B71888CA     //  Well, Sil is gonna fuckin' hear about this, I guaran-fuckin-tee you. Here...
A9170970     //  Okay, maybe this will shut them up. 
6F595EA6     //  Go piss on somebody else, okay?
61904730     //  Don't tell me you're here again about the music. 
CC0F92A2     //  I'm here about the music. Play something new, Nicky , and stop giving me shit.
1FDF07C8     //  Who's the fuckin' DJ here, you or me?
120FBBD6     //  Hey, fuckhead, it'll be hard to spin those records with broken thumbs, right?
CAEE1E3E     //  Send one of the bimbos up. She can pick a whole set.
D53B411F     //  Just change the music. What's the problem?
D395E0EB     //  Unless it comes from Sil, I ain't changing shit.
0B686A8E     //  You are. But the clientele wanna hear something different.
4AB9C055     //  What clientele? I ain't heard no one complainin'.
5BD8BD1F     //  I'm giving you the fuckin' order. Change the fuckin' music!
14D71F0B     //  Ok, ok, sure, chill out. Try this.
8630D8BD     //  I'm just trying to keep everyone happy.
433889FF     //  I'm not changing shit unless Silvio gives me the word.
4C09043D     //  People at the bar, the girls... They make the money, remember? Keep 'em happy.
5B115A9D     //  Only if Sil gives the order. 
ADE14513     //  Does Silvio know you grope the merchandise during business hours?
6B04176C     //  Calm down, I'll change the music, all right?
EADC4E39     //  Sorry. No groping. They're tired of getting groped.
E947525E     //  I'm just having fun! You want new music? Fine. 
3BBE5A52     //  They're working their butts off, same as you. Now how bout it?
A3DF57BB     //  Sure thing Joey. Here you go.
2B3A6A68     //  I appreciate it.
88F27CF6     //  Go away, asshole.
9ED74D0B     //  You again? What is it this time?
20C6AF8A     //  Just play something different. And no crap!
07610F90     //  Lemme guess. Different music, right?
182DFEA2     //  Fucking mind reader here.
66172FE0     //  Not that big a mind to read.
40DE60C6     //  Can we get something different on?
68123A8E     //  Come on Joey, you serious?
FB8AF938     //  Don't fuck with me. Change it.
8E174BB1     //  Ok, what did you wanna hear?
6A347F52     //  Surprise me.
7DA1E6F7     //  Look who's fuckin' back.
10BCA174     //  I'm not in the mood, asshole. Just change it.
654BB9FC     //  Sure, no prob.
C719D9F7     //  Play something else?
B8899175     //  You read my mind.
4F65737F     //  Tony's like your uncle or something, right? Sorry about before.
8C463214     //  Forget about it.
6F466185     //  Want me to mix it up a little?
6DF09456     //  Yeah, do that.
C0D6F937     //  Can we change the channel?
1F1D53D7     //  Hey, I'm all over it, boss.
A6166CB1     //  What's up, Joey?
2A774B28     //  Same request, different music.
AD8C3754     //  You got it.
AE4EA9FF     //  Forget hockey. It's idiotic. Bunch of thugs.
80BF81D8     //  Baseball, my friend, is a game for intellectuals.
192D9EE7     //  Then why do you like it?
3E201308     //  Ho! Watch your fucking mouth!
6C75DE0C     //  Hey Paulie, here's this week.
76925F28     //  Not bad, junior.
E1FA79B0     //  Anytime you're ready to express your gratitude, the envelope's always waiting.
FA9869D0     //  Understood. You need anything else?
1ED2C0AC     //  I'm taking my ma to Fernando's For Hair. 
7E739477     //  Check in with T. He's in the office.
525C1196     //  See, this one shows a little respect. 
8F18D284     //  Like he's got a choice. He works for you.
794C4A21     //  Generosity, my friend, is a virtue not an obligation. 
9C35C8CA     //  That's bullshit, Paulie!
48267576     //  A $25,000 watch! That's kinda hard to miss.
BD01EC71     //  Fuckin Reggie...
03D9B614     //  Never wear a dead man's watch, 'specially if you whacked the guy.
4D00AAEF     //  Paulie's gonna be pissed.
7A269BAD     //  I gotta tell him?
94FB2506     //  Better you than someone else.
C2DFFA82     //  Is he sober this time?
E44DBA1A     //  Only cause he just got here.
95BD8B5E     //  He's in the lounge next door.
69469788     //  Then go lean on him. Take Joey.
62AE120F     //  Like I need him? We're not talking about a left guard, T.
53E7B771     //  After you're done, we'll finish our conversation.
7A4E0464     //  The guy kicks field goals, Tony.
FE5AD58E     //  He doesn't even wear pads!
832175D1     //  Joey, you gotta help me.
6688AA91     //  This is my fuckin' dad! I can only bullshit him so long.
6732FDA2     //  I got a line on a chop shop in Newark, Do-Right Auto Repair.
5F72842F     //  Couldn't find no address.
C45E5997     //  Did you look on the internet?
07656CFF     //  A.J. Maybe you oughta just tell Tony.
D97FC175     //  Come clean, you know.
457AB1CA     //  Hold the phone. I'll find the address.
691D1D98     //  A.J.'s a nice kid, but he ain't the one who's gonna get hurt.
7E83F7CB     //  You want me to tell Tony? That's bullshit. I ain't a rat.

6D6E819B     //  I'm keepin' my word with A.J.
889E7D08     //  Then find that chop shop.

5C9DEF87     //  Tony, if it's okay, there's something I gotta ask.
B04612CD     //  Give it a minute. Let the guys say hello.
E3291B01     //  Little nervous, huh?
73F45CF6     //  I gotta ask you, Tone. About my father...
3A33DB95     //  I was thinking about him too. What he'd think, seeing you here. 
DC38564F     //  Is he really dead like, you know, some people think?
975DB6ED     //  He took a fuckin' oath - the same one you're about to take. And then he violated that oath. End of story.
6D49B178     //  I just thought that maybe, you know, he had no good choices, no way out, you know?
CC433D13     //  Or something.
9288D8E1     //  Let it go, kid. I know you ain't your father... Oh, one more thing.
9D183B91     //  Look, there's no names on the back now. Those people are long gone, thanks to you.
4EC24252     //  So, this is yours.
4440E22E     //  See you inside.
F3780AD0     //  Hey, Joey.
7251EFA7     //  I'm happy for you, son. In fact, I'm proud as a fuck.
FB24389B     //  It's too bad you can't be here.
6B6669CD     //  Hey, I had my run. Now it's your turn. 
9099559D     //  So, me working for Tony... You don't mind?
58BA91E1     //  Hey, I wish things were different, but you working with my best friends on Earth?
124CB927     //  It's like a fuckin' dream come true.
65480CA7     //  I thought you might be bitter.
B38D4139     //  Bitter? Nah. Just forget about it. Go enjoy yourself. 
46994ED3     //  Hey, Joey! 
A25CFC4B     //  How long we gotta wait?
24BC0A9C     //  That inspector's right - the air in here sucks.
7BF87163     //  What do you care? You're like a dream or something, right?
391C2E87     //  You busting my chops? After I told you not to lie to Tony?
549D5DCB     //  I didn't lie to him. I just omitted part of the truth. 
2140D644     //  Careful, kid. Meat ain't the only thing that gets chopped up around here.
A38FD20A     //  I heard you had some trouble at the docks. Nearly got jumped. 
93F7B73B     //  Nothing I couldn't handle.
4126BAA5     //  Beginner's luck, believe you me.
EC98FDD0     //  I guess you think you're a regular Whipass Willie now, don't you, junior?
FCA52CF1     //  Not worried, are you?
21EC3558     //  Not for my fuckin' sake.
2769E698     //  You've got three code violations in this room alone. Cockroaches, rat droppings... I'm shutting you down.
AA837AB9     //  You sure this is necessary? It's a popular place - a neighborhood place.
DB4ACE41     //  I work for the city, mister. This isn't open to discussion.
FA834674     //  City better have a good medical plan. You're gonna need it.
4461902B     //  Careful, kid. I was an all-city bantam-weight when you were shittin' yellow.
37F8BD94     //  Then let's see it, Grandpa!
12E1F3D1     //  You like to fight? So do I.
CBD2B445     //  Does this look like a boxing ring, grandpa? Around here, losers don't live to tell.
103BD292     //  If I was ten years younger... You better fix that meat locker. Someone could get sick!

9C62A0A8     //  Watch your fuckin' mouth!
5CE49667     //  How's the city payin' these days? Maybe I can do better.
CF12D896     //  You want to pay me off?
9A253426     //  If that's what it takes.
5583FA63     //  Fine by me.
44F46530     //  Fuck, no. I was gonna offer you a sandwich... On the house.
1A16C917     //  From here? After what I seen? Look, I'm closing this place.
ABD7605B     //  Look, I admire the job you do. We'll take care of the problem.
70A732F9     //  I've heard that before. Forget it.
46CAE3D8     //  That's it, pencil pusher.
FA834674     //  City better have a good medical plan. You're gonna need it.
35182140     //  W-wait. Don't. Maybe I'm being too hasty. Just take care of the problem.
573A51FD     //  Will do. Now get the fuck out.
6255910B     //  I'm with you, pal. There's nothing to discuss.
B8C26957     //  You know, I don't normally do this. My wife's been sick...
BD972B45     //  Hey, I'm happy to help. Good luck.
05C2A95F     //  Just remembered - low on cash. Come back tomorrow.
F2DCFB99     //  Oh yeah? Forget it. I'm closing you down.
7DE4F9DD     //  Fuck you!
B4F98361     //  All right fine! You want to keep this germ factory open, be my guest!
F52BEC88     //  Get the fuck out.
13C67A20     //  That Trishelle's a good kid. Hold onto that one.
F743AEA1     //  I'm planning on it.

F1766BD0     //  My mom made me.
50C598FB     //  Have you ever thought of converting?
9C374EB1     //  To Judaism? Sorry, I'm a pork lover.
FC7A2BD9     //  I didn't realize Hesh had so many... other friends.
24E718C7     //  I can't believe he'd stick his hand in the disposal.
85CF0853     //  Lost three nails and a thumb print. Have to use his left 'till it heals. 
791E6242     //  What about school?
E7513DB7     //  He'll use the computer. Kids don't need both hands nowadays...
B2623CDE     //  So, what do you think?
432C8B5D     //  I got a son about the same age.
662CCE9E     //  What's his name?

DBB5C2AE     //  That's your name too, isn't it?
887E8D14     //  It's our tradition.
0C5427C4     //  My husband wanted to do the same, but I put my foot down.
21239534     //  Why's that? 
79340CC9     //  A kid named "Myron"? Today?
02C14B5B     //  It's a great name!
1B4A4CCD     //  Yeah, he's kinda multi-cultural...
AA720EF0     //  So are you in the carting business? Like Tony Soprano?
7F9CDBEE     //  My son's bar mitzvah was last year.

89A0E569     //  I can't find the espresso.

7B9B1ABF     //  Be reeshi... bara Eeeloohim... What's it mean?
47AEE7BD     //  It means, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth...
0055C157     //  We got that in our book too.
5D1F7005     //  I know. Our Torah is like your Old Testament.
CBC6CB57     //  So yours is only half as long. 
B77006F1     //  I guess.
886C96AD     //  How many commandments you got? Five? Maybe I oughta convert. 
B9073B3F     //  Retail pickles... I'm writing the business plan.
352DE45D     //  And there's a market?
6A07E14A     //  GOURMET pickles, get it? Free-range pickles. Twenty-five bucks a jar. The minimum investment is twenty thousand.
12A3E164     //  When do you take the pickles public?
E71681A6     //  Never. We get a little upmarket buzz, then unload to one of the big boys for millions. 
15840ADF     //  Okay, I'm in. The old lady loves pickles...
14CB8A25     //  Another kid? After this?
7C28168E     //  I'll get a vasectomy this week.
EC6BDAD9     //  More like venture capital.
729E8EA9     //  This party's gotta cost.
289A9686     //  I'm sure Hesh got a deal.
BC5433F1     //  The rabbi says Gabe has a mature understanding of the Torah.
5F370F1B     //  Let me ask you something. How much can a good rabbi make?
3092D5D5     //  My brother had a mime at his bar mitzvah.
4AEB33BE     //  Are you a friend of Hesh's?
CD0EE8E4     //  Didn't Paulie just tell you to go check out the kitchen?
60555078     //  What are you waiting for? 
D5B0DE5F     //  This is some party for just turning thirteen.
9E3BF532     //  A friend of a friend.
A0EACE71     //  Hey, how about some privacy?
49B7A2F3     //  I'll call you.
9C4D1E3D     //  You wanna watch?
F4199594     //  So, as I was saying... thirty thousand dollars, repaid over, say, twelve months. Twenty-five hundred a month plus points... you'll have it covered in no time.
7256F879     //  Points? You mean I have to pay interest?
366A0A82     //  Hey, I'm out thirty grand here. That's money I could have invested elsewhere instead of pissing it away on your bullshit.
5FC7978F     //  Of course, I understand.
13B7041E     //  I thought you would.
A2FB2907     //  Hesh must really love his nephew.
5B73B2B1     //  You mean, the nephew must really love Hesh!
C4E34AB1     //  Too many kids. I need another drink.
71B50500     //  Open bar. Not bad for for a je- a thirteen year old. 
2BFA6F9D     //  Gotta make good, professor.
6A4D6429     //  Pay Tribute
D0F522B7     //  Calm down, A.J. Just tell me, are you all right?
2DDA979C     //  A.J. got carjacked!
E32BA70E     //  I'll be right there. You're gonna be fine.
CDFBEC2E     //  Motherfuck!
221EAFE5     //  Those sons of bitches tried to run him down with his own car!
4A2E0006     //  My car!
04C002B1     //  Who?
E0B1F036     //  Who the fuck do you think! They were twins. Italian looking.
DDD1AB57     //  Buscetta's twins. 
0C71B9CA     //  First the drugs, now this.
4A3721C3     //  It's time to push back.
E4B0B2AE     //  Start with Angie's porn studio.
1F14310A     //  That place Louis runs.
4DEAEAB2     //  You blow it the fuck up!
BE022B8E     //  Would you like to start the next mission?
8BB1E88D     //  Tony still with Angie?
2A7B87E7     //  Last I saw. 
22D6F634     //  That bald fuck mention his nephew again?
E9B9B00D     //  The name came up.
36095ECC     //  That fucking Mario. So you can't "hear" a mirage. That asshole knew exactly what I was getting at.
A8879EA5     //  Did you congratulate the birthday boy? 
706B81D1     //  Congratulations Gabe. I'm Joey LaRocca.
5FD07FC8     //  I guess you don't go to temple then.
040D99C7     //  Smart kid.
2BD1F35A     //  What happened? Did Neil deliver?
D56131B7     //  Paid in full. 
8575E02B     //  What about that cop we heard about?
4D75BD89     //  A probation guy looking for Mario.
1EAC81EF     //  Neil buys his powder from Buscetta.
FE6927A8     //  From Angie? You're fucking kidding me.
458B01EC     //  It gets better. Angelo's still planning that thing over in Cranford.
4A2E2AEA     //  That motherfucker... I told him it was no go.
6C5AFE1D     //  I'm sorry, boss. I just heard.
8AC64230     //  Heard what?
1BB10CDF     //  About Silvio's investment.
8F77B297     //  I repeat, heard what?
7CB76AE2     //  His stock just tanked. Did you buy in, too?
7BFB1048     //  Silvio's my consiglieri, not my broker.
C98DCA4C     //  Sorry, boss, I just thought...
59F2EA61     //  Vito, you ain't paid to think... thank God.
E66AB075     //  Joey - Silvio needs a hand at the bar.
D07F57A7     //  Is that all the stock news for today?
312C1478     //  Tony, I'm sorry. I got confused -
06CF6166     //  You don't think I got more important things to worry about?
F4548A7A     //  Sorry, boss!
A33A0488     //  Like the fact that Angie B. is plotting a drug haul at the Marine Terminal.
F9DB7BD7     //  But that's your territory!
E788E210     //  Now you know why I give fuck all about Silvio's thing. 
F907FF18     //  It's an insult to all of us. No way we let him do it, T.
5402EFF0     //  Maybe you can bitch slap Angie to death, too, huh, Paulie?
F22ECD49     //  That was an act of passion, which I still regret. This is business.
B51E2B2D     //  We could get approval from New York - just to be safe.
158642B3     //  The guy's like a dog taking a crap on my lawn. I don't need the city council to tell me what to do. I already know.
C7F95A5F     //  So what's the plan, skip?
1E0B5711     //  For now we do nothing. Let him think we know nothing. 
74DCF77B     //  We put that dog down, right, T?
419838A8     //  Animal control is one option. 
46195282     //  You heard the skip. He wants a barbecue.
C4B38B47     //  He said the clams smelled funny. He wanted to inspect the kitchen. 
1509C1B8     //  You could have said "no"!
51B17F4B     //  I was scared. He said he was a really important food critic, and I could lose my job.....
8E5FA862     //  Where you been? Vito's been back for hours.
ED0FB66A     //  I had to see a girl home.
BF282595     //  Before you sit down, Sir Galahad, go to the kitchen. Somebody's snoopin' around.
72CCC802     //  And Artie don't need no bad reviews.
407A9410     //  And next time, fuck the critic. The kitchen is terra non grata, okay?
1CE7CBC6     //  Thank you, Paulie.
374C651C     //  What are you waiting for? Take care of it.
05118C3F     //  Slate Boxton's track record has been phenomenal.
2531A218     //  Go figure.
5B22C850     //  Hey, it'll go back up, right?
2BABF785     //  Wrong. The drug trials were a complete bust. One guy shot himself.
E72342B1     //  Fucking A... 
06F1D414     //  Chapter 11 time...
4EB6EC2E     //  I smell a scam.
E0118F39     //  Joey, grab him.
C0186663     //  This was an investment! There's no guarantee -
8919B917     //  You said it was a lock.
7D6C3476     //  Sil, I'm an academic, not a stockbroker.
8C7CC335     //  Listen up, smart guy. Somebody's covering my losses.
D18F916A     //  Joey, your work here is done. Go away.
B65F596F     //  Stop, please! I'll pay you. I just don't have that much money right now.
36E21271     //  You don't have to pay it all at once. I'm not trying to be unreasonable.
AF8719D0     //  Thank you.
4CF62256     //  We'll put our heads together, figure out a payment plan. 
060F04E9     //  You want me to stick around, Sil? I oughta check in with Paulie.
8A129D23     //  Go on, we'll be fine. The Professor's a man of his word.
9015BEC9     //  Guess T thinks you're all right, inviting you here.
29B59919     //  And you don't? I helped you with the gym, then the kicker. 
02314476     //  Keep it down. You fuck up my odds and you're a dead man.
107F3029     //  Hey, Tony still mad I hurt that kicker?
DF61C76A     //  Again, luck is with you. Automatic Chad's gonna play hurt. 
7CB000EB     //  Hey, Tone, fellas, mission accomplished.
A4CCB5AB     //  Didn't think I'd be seeing you tonight. What about that girl?
46549F43     //  Turns out she still lives with her folks.
F6FA949E     //  So, what happened with your girlfriend?
7CC1CDCC     //  I got her out. Thanks for all your help.
35890ED5     //  So, who's the lucky lady? 
2CB64AC1     //  Some broad from the porn place. 
69B0C4E6     //  Brave man, banging one of those disease carriers. 
CF9309B0     //  Hey, watch your fucking mouth.
9C87F9CB     //  Whoa! Listen to him!
9A5FEC42     //  Oh, the balls on this kid!
5133CF5A     //  Careful there, kid.
26A5BA60     //  You light a match and think you can sit with us and fucking talk back to ME?
13D8E44A     //  What about Saul? Did that earn a seat at the table?
54070374     //  What's he talking about? 
C29BF6D1     //  One rat begets another.
FFF31D8F     //  You weren't complaining when I was shoveling your shit. 
7C5B740B     //  Not another fucking word.
62FABA8E     //  That's it, Chrissy. Pony up.
D22B09F5     //  Whoah, a one-two punch. First the insult, now a cash expenditure. 
C04CB771     //  Can I stop kissing your ass now?
E4E2DFD1     //  Anything Joey does, I get a taste!
7C5B740B     //  Not another fucking word.
4FECC7A0     //  You walked into that one, Chrissy.
C7714A89     //  You keep saying that. It doesn't get any funnier.
3BEC00BC     //  But it's still fuckin' true.
6454EB86     //  Think Chrissy won that round, kid.
90F03B6C     //  I never said that.
77397DA0     //  Very diplomatic. You musta scared him.

A1B5BB2B     //  He's got a point, Joey.
2A5969BD     //  What you said was over the line.
207F8A1F     //  She's a PORN STAR. There is no line. 
FDFE2504     //  You walked into that one, Joey.
CFF00EE0     //  No fucking way.
F0EE2ACB     //  I'm a fucking captain, asshole.
A1B5BB2B     //  He's got a point, Joey.
94F298B7     //  How 'bout torchin' up a crack pipe. Would that do it?
91725C3F     //  Fuck you! Two years sober, asshole!
1AEF9E8E     //  Ohh? So that's why you're such a prickly motherfucker.
9D9459C0     //  You are fucking dead!
0823E453     //  You're gonna kill him for telling the truth?
8BBB95B5     //  I can see it's made you a nicer person.

C169C71B     //  Calm down, Chrissy, he's just a kid. 
9178AB33     //  I'm happy for you. Now leave me alone, okay?
23426311     //  Then get the hell out of my face.
1ED6AC12     //  Sounds like a workable solution to the problem. Go. 
B8810FA9     //  Enough already.
E6E2A887     //  Joey, have a seat.
FF68CC3E     //  You earned it.
413F2A11     //  It took me years to get a place at this table!
BA0FCC6C     //  Now this rat bastard comes along, he's instantly one of the family.
7B071DDC     //  Not your call, Chris.
19E761E2     //  Come on, Chris, can't we bury the hatchet?
A916DA7D     //  Yeah, maybe in the back of your head.
F36CE929     //  That's enough, Christopher! You've made your point. You either leave the kid alone or get outta here.
E2ADC291     //  I'll say it again - I am not my father.
559F6FFD     //  Yeah, you're a little worse.
82603A76     //  Okay, shut up and sit down. Both of you.
9A6EE8A1     //  Fine by me. I ain't the hothead around here.
7577584D     //  Hey, kid, you don't talk like that to a captain, no matter how immature he is. 
E40091D9     //  Now get the fuck outta here.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
E0BDEDC8     //  Hey, it's A.J. I'm freaked. I think Desmond and the Dreads are following me. 
F1A4379F     //  Where are you? Your dad's right here...
C52A2E16     //  Joey, you gotta come get me. I'll be in the gym, by the juice bar.
D2EB4CA9     //  That the girlfriend?
71E4671D     //  How'd you guess? Her folks went to sleep.
520256D2     //  I gotta go.
D35D09A4     //  Have fun with the whore.
F285B64F     //  Are you fuckin' kiddin' me? I just told you to sit down!
E5EE3F01     //  Tony, let the kid get laid. He's got blue balls.
70C3E2E6     //  Needs a little oil on the dipstick. 
25A73381     //  All right, fine. Get outta here.
7C2272C2     //  YOU got to come? Must be movin' up.
AE12210B     //  Just hope I'm done buying everyone lunch.
AB6E3B85     //  Dream on, meatball. That's gonna be years.
0B32863C     //  C'mon, Joey. Let's go show 'em what a Jersey camp fire is.
AC003430     //  You get some 'tavola? Try the blintzes. Delicious.
EA8ABFFC     //  You should know, V.
49C8E875     //  Did you see all those envelopes? This kid's fuckin' rich. 
5939B9F5     //  Makes up for never having Christmas.
BA734A83     //  Hey, speaking of which, I got a little present for you. 
81A9C4A3     //  I'm listening.
7D5592B1     //  Hey, can we talk somewhere more private?
2A8BB3CA     //  Yeah?
10AF04A7     //  Hold on.
96154CFA     //  Meet me in the bathroom. I'll be right there.
F4FEDFAC     //  Do you mind? This is private. I'll see you in the bathroom.
6F7C0CB4     //  This is nuts, kid. A.J.'s gonna try to lie his way out of this?
CF184B0B     //  I'm sure it's not the first time.
B62D4416     //  And when the truth comes out, who do you think will pay - 
2BCB34A6     //  Tony's Kid or Rat Bastard, Jr.?
53A9300F     //  He'll never find out.
04A5377D     //  I used to say the same thing, like a fucking mantra. 
3FC8E97F     //  Look who's here.
11618910     //  Everybody's newest "Wiseguy of the Week". 
3BEBE88D     //  And all it took was wastin' his best friend.
C41A9564     //  What's your fucking point?
BEBBC429     //  Dude. Were you just talking to yourself?
5CC1340E     //  You wanted to tell me something?
FCEC73E4     //  I'm throwing a rave with my buddy next weekend.
78599EED     //  Thirty bucks to get in, cash bar, it's gonna be huge.
F21FD1CC     //  I want you to work security.
FD35E51C     //  Is three hundred bucks good for the night?
BAEC61B6     //  Sure. I'm in.
6EE0AF8A     //  Fine, four hundred.
3EF8051F     //  No way.
DC85DF01     //  One night. Four hundred bucks.
A3708987     //  I probably shouldn't, but kickin' up to Paulie is killing me.
1C7F75C7     //  Sweet.
6496E3D2     //  Are you crazy? Your dad will have a fuck-fit if he finds out.
25856CB4     //  Five hundred. That's my final offer.
14AD0C53     //  Remember, this is just between us.
75F28421     //  No problem.
3D8D2779     //  I mean it, Joey. You won't tell my Dad, will ya?
C75F755C     //  I'm not a fucking rat, all right? 
97F68ECC     //  Just being careful, that's all.
D4712D05     //  Call you next week, okay? Right now I really gotta take a dump.
5934E0F3     //  Hey. That's my toe.
70537F23     //  Then move it.
55DE58E1     //  You won't get close unless you're a kid. He always gives us money at these things.
9A5C6BB1     //  My dad says Hesh is a gangster.
695A38BD     //  Your dad oughta shut up.
0E845D14     //  That's mean.
EBC3F33F     //  A boy's bar mitzvah is a very big deal.
FE24D674     //  Kinda like getting made, huh?
2518B0E5     //  I wouldn't know about that.
2F73E8C9     //  I haven't seen you at temple. 
86E36F25     //  That's 'cause I don't go.
87AAFB41     //  You must be one of the "paisans." Such a cute word. 
835B3C24     //  Are you enjoying the party?
C8481DD9     //  What's not to enjoy?
24093156     //  You sure you're not Jewish?
2578B3E1     //  I never had biscotti after a Bar Mitzvah before.
13BA5EFD     //  Pretty good, hey?
AF0D6369     //  Yes, it so dippable!
A60B8097     //  Mrs. Kirschner, how you doing?!
C75F0894     //  Joey! What a surprise. How do you know Gabriel?
55694A90     //  Through his Uncle Hesh.
0490C8B7     //  Is it true he's a gangster?
43C893D3     //  It's great to see you, Mrs. K.
A4CE7D73     //  So how's David doing? Haven't seen him since shop class. 
D03ADC3E     //  He's a pediatrician now, works in North Caldwell. And your profession? 
28CAE4AA     //  Management and Finance. Gotta run. Say hello to Davy Boy...
C1A6F11E     //  Finally. We're ready to order. 
A196F3B5     //  I'm not your waiter, lady.
EBCB42E3     //  Then find him, okay?
C09F910A     //  I'll get right on it.
65C0306D     //  Hey, how about some water?
6CCD6DBC     //  I'm not that guy either.
121183B8     //  Why didn't you say so sooner?
BAE23E80     //  You didn't ask, bitch.
CE1AF8A6     //  Tell Artie there's no problem. The guy loved everything.
F6A47887     //  God bless you. 
E53D4BBD     //  The clams, they came in this morning. 
6071D9EE     //  Excuse me, this area's not open to the public.
7EC7742B     //  I'm not the public. 
11B45AE5     //  I heard. Artie ain't here, see, so come back when he is, okay?
D718F4F8     //  I think I've seen enough, thanks. Review runs on Tuesday. 
1BE5985B     //  How about a few bucks and we forget this ever happened?
FC09F8B3     //  Do you actually intend to bribe me?
0E6AB48B     //  I'll just reimburse you for your meal. Bet it cost a real bundle - the appetizers, the wine, champagne...
CEBF570F     //  Seems a fair way to resolve the situation... Thank you.
09CA1A82     //  You'd take it too, wouldn't you, ya fuckin' hack.
6A7B83B1     //  Absolutely not! I have a reputation!
E2DC13CC     //  No kiddin'. Me, too.
15ACA2D7     //  Hey man, everyone has an off night.
503187CE     //  This is my third visit. It wasn't an off night.
00219ED0     //  About to be for someone.
8209C1F1     //  And your obit's on Wednesday, if you trash this joint.
6CC85949     //  Feel like I'm in a mob pizzeria. Look, mister, this is my job.
1F690E78     //  You think I give a fuck, Mr. Big City Critic?
0164D16D     //  It wouldn't be fair to say nothing without talking to Artie.
E363861F     //  It wasn't fair calling that slop linguini with clam sauce.
9AAAA607     //  You got a real way with words, asshole.
FA9C0385     //  Then take a rain check. I'll cover the meal, any expenses, we'll try again some other night.
5DDC2F7E     //  You mean you want to bribe me?
3CE4FEA3     //  Just a couple clams to make up for the bad ones you had tonight.
71C1A0CC     //  Does have a certain charm to it - Deal.
F87F08D3     //  Whoa! Watch your fuckin' mouth. This is a class joint, mister.
5354C211     //  That's it, the review stands.
6EA292F9     //  The fuck it does...
58025A58     //  Hold on, you can't do this!
3F2845D3     //  My pleasure. Now, how about I bump it up a little, and you write somethin' nice.
35EE2403     //  Not a full review, just a mention in my weekly round-up.
4CB1F157     //  Hey, I'm not picky.
3FF9FE9E     //  Jeez, just realized - I'm a little short on dough. How about I mail it to you?
936A22DD     //  You're trying to humiliate me. Forget it. Enjoy my review.
7DE4F9DD     //  Fuck you!
222D2B10     //  Change of plans. You are writin' a review, a five-star rave.
22EDC13F     //  I can't do that, the best is four.
02DD54FB     //  You want me to keep going, is that it?
3D80D212     //  Five! It'll be five-star! All right?
1704E47D     //  And say something nice about Artie. Man works his ass off.
4DCC62C2     //  Can you sneak some rum into my soda?
