BCE2@12  //  ~z~your stinking Grove Street brother Smoke,
BCE2@06  //  ~z~Hey look, you go into the barrio with that big willy bullshit,
BCE2@02  //  ~z~Better. Thank you. You came through for me.
BCE2@22  //  ~z~Shit. I gotta keep my eye on the highway to San Fierro.
BCE2@23  //  ~z~Maybe I'll see something.
BCE2@03  //  ~z~This ain't over, man. I did this to take care of my woman.

BCE5W16  //  ~z~What are you gonna say about that?
BCE5@06  //  ~z~Look, Catalina, you called it off, remember, 'just business'.

BCE4@09  //  ~z~where you from, friend?
BCE4@01  //  ~z~Sorry, holmes, I had no idea when the race would be.
BCE4W11  //  ~z~I guess that's our wake up call. Nice meeting you.
BCE4@05  //  ~z~you know when it's time to race!
BCE4@11  //  ~z~Relax. This isn't a parade, pal. But, you know, we gotta be careful.
BCE4W01  //  ~z~and I never mind losing to a guy who's willing to push himself right to the edge.
BCE4W05  //  ~z~because, for some reason, the local police don't appreciate our noble sport.
BCE4@15  //  ~z~Get your car started, we're about to go. Good luck, Carl Johnson.
BCE5@22  //  ~z~Now let's race!
BCE5@26  //  ~z~And when I said that I missed you..!
BCE4W09  //  ~z~maybe we can do a little business together.
BCE4@19  //  ~z~For sure, man.
BCE4W04  //  ~z~Listen, it's best if we clear the hell out of here as soon as possible
BCE4@14  //  ~z~Listen, out here we like to race for cash or pink slips - racer's choice.
BCE4@10  //  ~z~I'm from Grove Street Families, Los Santos. What's happening?
BCE4W00  //  ~z~You drive with style, Carl Johnson -
BCE4W08  //  ~z~Uh, you know what? If you ever find yourself in San Fierro, give me a call,
BCE4@18  //  ~z~Man, where is this guy?
BCE5@23  //  ~z~Crazy bitch.
BCE4@08  //  ~z~You haven't been to one of our meets before,
BCS5_BD  //  ~z~Claude would make you feel inadequate!
BCE4@04  //  ~z~When the gasoline runs through your veins like the burning passion,
BCE4@00  //  ~z~Hey, I've been waiting forever, man. Where the hell you been?
BCE4W10  //  ~z~Yeah, I might just do that.
BCE5W07  //  ~z~Goodbye Mr. Johnson, I will NOT be missing you!
BCE5@17  //  ~z~like hitting a man with a frying pan while he sleeps.
BCE5W03  //  ~z~Not only was he racing, but he was satisfying me, fully!
BCS5_AH  //  ~z~Oh Claude, I don't know if I'm woman enough!
BCE5W17  //  ~z~Go, I ain't gonna miss you.
BCE5@07  //  ~z~What kind of a man are you?
BCE5@03  //  ~z~Oh, so THIS is where you been, eh?
BCS5_AD  //  ~z~Oh Claude, it's bigger than the gear stick!
BCE5W09  //  ~z~The deed to a garage in San Fierro.
BCE5@19  //  ~z~Are you jealous? Are you going to fight for me?
BCE5@11  //  ~z~I did this for us, for me and you!
BCE5W01  //  ~z~Being a better driver ain't no unfair advantage.
BCE5W05  //  ~z~Yeah whatever, anyway, man, what is it, cash or pink slip?
BCE5@15  //  ~z~I cannot keep my passions holed up, they need a release.
BCE5W11  //  ~z~Liberty City? Yeah, whatever, have a good time.
BCS5_AF  //  ~z~Five orgasms in as many minutes!
BCE5@05  //  ~z~You prefer the curves of some car to those of a real woman?
BCS5_AB  //  ~z~Claude, you're the best driver I've ever bedded!
BCE5@09  //  ~z~When I say, I no interested no more, I mean that I long for you!
BCE5@21  //  ~z~You are jealous and a coward!
BCE5@25  //  ~z~Wait! Hey, that's my...
BCE4@12  //  ~z~Wu Zi Mu, but my friends call me 'Woozie'. How you doing?
BCE4W02  //  ~z~As for me, I'm a man who honors his bet.
BCE4W06  //  ~z~Yeah. Thanks for the advice.
BCE4@16  //  ~z~Be careful CJ!
BCE4@02  //  ~z~Riiight - you just happened to show up
BCE4W12  //  ~z~Oooh, yeah!
BCE4@06  //  ~z~I think you're getting high on that country air, man!
BCS5_BF  //  ~z~Claude is so manful, so FORCEFUL!
BCS5_BB  //  ~z~Carl, are you jealous, heh?
BCE4@07  //  ~z~Hey, CJ, look...
BCE4@03  //  ~z~five minutes after everybody else, huh?
BCS5_BC  //  ~z~Claude has such girth, he is AMAZING!
BCS5_BG  //  ~z~I never knew there was so much MORE to sex!
BCE5@24  //  ~z~What the fuck?
BCE5@20  //  ~z~No, no, I can take rejection.
BCE4W07  //  ~z~OK, I gotta go.
BCE4@17  //  ~z~There's something real strange about that dude, man.
BCE4@13  //  ~z~Wha..? CJ. Carl Johnson.
BCE4W03  //  ~z~Well, you learn pretty fast with the police on your ass.
BCE5@04  //  ~z~THIS is how you repay my tenderness!
BCS5_AC  //  ~z~Hands on the wheel, Claude, hands on the wheel!
BCE5@00  //  ~z~Damn, man, now what?
BCE5W10  //  ~z~My lover needs his car so we can go to Liberty City.
BCS5_AG  //  ~z~Marry me, Claude, marry me!
BCE5@08  //  ~z~When I say 'just business', I mean that I love you!
BCE5W08  //  ~z~Hey, wait a minute, bitch! What is this shit?
BCE5@18  //  ~z~This, CARL, THIS is my new man.
BCE5W04  //  ~z~The advantage of a stick shift, I guess.
BCE5@14  //  ~z~Then what the fuck was this about?
BCE5@10  //  ~z~Wait, Catalina, wait! Leave my car alone,

CAS4B16  //  ~z~But I'm a fucking raspberry!
CAS4_ND  //  ~z~P. what you need is some food down ya.

CAS4B17  //  ~z~You're not a fucking raspberry!
CAS4C17  //  ~z~Top-of-the-range, man.

CAS4_CF  //  ~z~We'll come back for you, I promise!
CAS4B23  //  ~z~So, where am I taking y'all?
CAS4_TB  //  ~z~I think I found a way to scope Caligula's without causing too much suspicion.
CAS4_FK  //  ~z~What'n tarnation?
CAS4C23  //  ~z~Too numerous, oppressively insurmountable
CAS4C27  //  ~z~I'll give you a tinkle later.
CAS4B27  //  ~z~Fuck off, string.
CAS4_CB  //  ~z~Oooo, this is comfy!
CAS4_37  //  ~s~Go and pick up ~b~Paul ~s~and ~b~Maccer~s~.
CAS4_CJ  //  ~z~Don't make me slap you, sunshine!
CAS4_FG  //  ~z~And that one done screwed my sis!
CAS4_HD  //  ~z~Don't leave me in their evil clutches!
CAS4_FC  //  ~z~What are you talking about?
CAS5_DB  //  ~z~I didn't think he was going to be discharged 'til tomorrow!
CAS5_12  //  ~s~Quick get in the ~b~ambulance~s~ the driver might have called for backup before he was killed.
CAS5_16  //  ~s~Looks like some backup has arrived, get Johnny back to the ~y~meat factory~s~.
CAS5A06  //  ~z~Crack on, Rosie - spit it out.
CAS5A02  //  ~z~Eh, there's some top fanny down at that pool, Pabsy.
CAS5A16  //  ~z~and blame the other one.
CAS5A12  //  ~z~and that's how I ended up here.
CAS5_EB  //  ~z~Yeah, who's got a death wish?
CAS5_06  //  ~s~Johnny must be in the other ~r~ambulance~s~, this one's the real deal.
CAS5_BC  //  ~z~Mr. Sindacco? There must be some mistake.
CAS5_32  //  ~r~The Mafia have escaped with Johnny.
CAS5_CC  //  ~z~Uggh, never...never ever gonna talk like that again.
CAS5A26  //  ~z~I'm gonna shoot over to the hospital, and move the body or something.
CAS5_CG  //  ~z~I need my bag emptied!
CAS5A22  //  ~z~I mean, he's in a shock-induced coma at the hospital across town.
CAS5_CF  //  ~z~Nurse, hey nurse!
CAS5A23  //  ~z~Now the Forellis - they will take this opportunity to rub him out.
CAS5_CB  //  ~z~I see the light!
CAS5A27  //  ~z~There you go, my love, things ain't so bad, are they?
CAS5_BB  //  ~z~Yeah, I'm here to pick up Mr. Sindacco.
CAS5A13  //  ~z~But, no one family would trust another family to run the casino,
CAS5A17  //  ~z~My only friend is a bird named Tony.
CAS5_07  //  ~s~You have just killed an innocent medic, Johnny must be in one of the other ~r~ambulances~s~.
CAS5_03  //  ~s~It must have been the Mafia that took Johnny, find the ~r~ambulance~s~ that contains Johnny.
CAS5_17  //  ~r~Johnny Sindacco was killed.
CAS5_13  //  ~s~Drive Johnny back to the ~y~meat factory~s~.
CAS5A03  //  ~z~Leave it out, dimlo, what's wrong with you?
CAS5_AB  //  ~z~If he wake up through all of this, I'm screwed...
CAS5A07  //  ~z~I threw it all away.
CAS5_EA  //  ~z~Alright, who's messing with Forelli business?
CAS5_01  //  ~s~You need a vehicle to pick up Johnny.
CAS5A19  //  ~z~Shit - let me think about this. You're gonna have to break it down for me real quick.
CAS5_05  //  ~s~Johnny must be in one of the other ~r~ambulances,~s~ this one's the real deal.
CAS5A15  //  ~z~So now I spend my days waiting for one family to cap me
CAS5_09  //  ~s~Looks like this is the ~r~ambulance~s~ that took Johnny, smash it up a bit and show the Mafia you mean business.
CAS5A11  //  ~z~So when I came out I started representing the Liberty City mob, again
CAS5A05  //  ~z~I'm really screwed.
CAS5_DA  //  ~z~Hey, Johnny, how you feelin'?
CAS5A09  //  ~z~But I couldn't lay off the blow, so I went into rehab.
CAS5_11  //  ~s~Quick get in the ~b~ambulance~s~ before any backup arrives.
CAS5_15  //  ~s~Get back in the ~b~ambulance~s~.
CAS5A25  //  ~z~I will get the axe, bullet, machete, whatever...
CAS5_CD  //  ~z~Fuck you, fuck you! Fuck fuck you!
CAS5A21  //  ~z~OK? I mean, something terrible has happened to Johnny.
CAS5A29  //  ~z~What's happenin'.
CAS5_31  //  ~s~Find the actual ~r~ambulance~s~ that the Mafia have taken before they escape!
CAS5_BD  //  ~z~An ambulance just picked him up.
CAS5_BE  //  ~z~Oh, OK. Thank you for your help.
CAS5A30  //  ~z~OK, OK, relax.
CAS5_BA  //  ~z~Hello, Sir, can I help you?
CAS5_CE  //  ~z~Oh my God, where am I?
CAS5A20  //  ~z~OK, OK - the Sindaccos are on the warpath.
CAS5_CA  //  ~z~Hey mother, mother is that you?
CAS5A24  //  ~z~Now if any hit between the families succeeds on my turf,
CAS5_30  //  ~s~The Mafia have been alerted by a distress call from the ambulance you just hit.
CAS5A00  //  ~z~Oi, Rosie, liven yourself up, Carl's here.
CAS5_AA  //  ~z~So here I am, about to try and rescue some guy I've scared half to death.
CAS5A04  //  ~z~Well are you going to tell him, or shall I?
CAS5_14  //  ~s~Take Johnny back to the ~y~meat factory~s~.
CAS5_10  //  ~s~You have alerted the Mafia to your presence, smash up the ~r~ambulance~s~ a bit and show them you mean business.
CAS5A08  //  ~z~OK, I had the power, the money, the ladies...
CAS5_04  //  ~s~Ram the ~r~ambulance~s~ and see how the driver reacts.
CAS5A18  //  ~z~I never fucked anyone over in my life who didn't have it coming to 'em.
CAS5_00  //  ~s~Find a ride and go pick up Johnny Sindacco from the ~y~hospital~s~.
CAS5A10  //  ~z~And everything went to shit, but so what?
CAS5_08  //  ~s~You have just killed an innocent medic, Johnny must be in the other ~r~ambulance~s~.
CAS5A14  //  ~z~so I was put forth as a neutral party.
CAS6_H0  //  Press ~k~~VEHICLE_ENTER_EXIT~ when stood in front of switches to operate them.
CAS6A16  //  ~z~Take control...
CAS6_EN  //  ~z~I ain't leading the way!
CAS6B16  //  ~z~He's doing much better, yeah.
CAS6B12  //  ~z~Ken who?
CAS6_EJ  //  ~z~Take those guys out and I'll put out the flames!
CAS6_KE  //  ~z~I'm calm, Mr. Calm, Mr. Calm, that's me, Mr. Calm.
CAS6_EB  //  ~z~I'm screwed!
CAS6_KA  //  ~z~Get in there, and be cool. Like you been out for a relaxing drive or something.
CAS6_EF  //  ~z~I ain't coming out until it's safe!
CAS6_12  //  ~s~You need to take ~b~Rosenberg~s~ to the ~y~abattoir~s~.
CAS6_JE  //  ~z~Too fucking right they are, dumb pussies!
CAS6_DB  //  ~z~Nothing. My bad. Now take cover.
CAS6_JA  //  ~z~Holy fuck, man, we work well as a team together, huh, CJ?
CAS6_ER  //  ~z~Aw, what you do that for?
CAS6A06  //  ~z~Absolutely screwed, but at least now I'm in the right frame of mind.
CAS6_AC  //  ~z~See how Johnny is,
CAS6_G7  //  ~s~You need to bring ~b~Rosenberg~s~ to the ~y~casino~s~.
CAS6B06  //  ~z~Okay, okay - chill!
CAS6_JM  //  ~z~Just drop me at the airport!
CAS6B02  //  ~z~Look, you gotta come with me this once.
CAS6_G3  //  ~s~All the witnesses are dead but you will have to wait until ~b~Rosenberg~s~ lets you out before you can leave.

DES9@25  //  ~z~don't look at it that way, will you?
DES9@29  //  ~z~Kill, schmill. Come on...

DES9@24  //  ~z~Huh, man, kill Government agents?
DES9_38  //  ~s~Press ~k~~VEHICLE_ENTER_EXIT~ to plant the bomb.
DES9@20  //  ~z~But if you screw this up, it causes a tinder box situation
DES9@28  //  ~z~And everybody goes crazy and has a lot of problems...
DES9_30  //  ~r~You fell out the plane!
DES9_A4  //  ~s~Go! Get up the plane's ~y~ramp~s~ now!
DES9_5   //  ~s~The plane is leaving. Use the bike to chase the plane and get up the ramp before it takes off.
DES9_24  //  ~s~You have the parachute. Now plant the bomb at the back of the plane.

DES9_BA  //  ~z~Ah, what's Toreno up to now?
DES9_28  //  ~s~Use the parachute to land safely.
DES9@18  //  ~z~Anyway, the point is - you and me, Carl, we're the same.

SHEQ5    //  ~z~I'm very sorry sir, I can't make it any clearer.
HST1A08  //  ~z~You gotta have a secret place to plan shit like this,

SHEQ1    //  ~z~Can I help you sir?
SHEX2Y   //  ~z~Oh, of course, the owners wouldn't want to take a gamble on that happening!

HE1_XB   //  ~z~You got it, CJ! Good work!
HE1_AA   //  ~z~Hey, my camera!
HEI1_20  //  ~s~That's it! That fire alarm ought to occupy those guards.
HST1A15  //  ~z~Meeting adjourned?
HST1A11  //  ~z~So, what do we do?

HE2_AC   //  ~z~The cops are on the way, this thrill seeker ain't gonna escape!
HE2_AK   //  ~z~Finally, some action around here!
HEI2_2   //  ~s~When close to a ~y~generator~s~ press ~k~~VEHICLE_ENTER_EXIT~ to plant the charges. You need one on each ~y~generator~s~.
HEI2_90  //  ~s~Go to the ~y~airport~s~. You're going to need a plane to parachute onto the dam quay.

HST4A17  //  ~z~is that... nothing can go wrong.
HST4A13  //  ~z~Hey, where's the coffee and donuts?
HEI2_43  //  ~s~You're too low, you need to gain some height to make the jump.
HEI2_57  //  ~s~Get in the ~b~plane~s~ on the end of the runway.
HST4A07  //  ~z~What did he say?
HST4A03  //  ~z~the number of people that were in on this job.
HEI2_53  //  ~s~Avoid getting spotted by the guards patrolling in the area
HE2_CB   //  ~z~Aw shit! The hatch locked behind me!
HEI2_52  //  ~s~Make your way to the end of the dam quay.
HST4A02  //  ~z~the size of this room might have limited
HST4A06  //  ~z~but please, fuck off.
HEI2_56  //  ~s~Try and keep her level, this is a good height to jump from.
HST4A16  //  ~z~OK, now, the important thing to remember with a plan like this,
HEI2_46  //  ~s~There's a ~g~knife ~s~stashed near one of the containers which you may find useful.
HE2_BB   //  ~z~Not yet, but we've locked the quay entrance and the cops are on the way.
HEI2_89  //  Remember to crouch to make less noise.
HE2_AB   //  ~z~He's in there somewhere, start looking!
HE2_AF   //  ~z~We need more men in here!
HE2_AJ   //  ~z~Must be seeing things. I thought that coffee tasted a bit odd!

HEI2_1   //  ~s~Find the ~y~entrance ~s~to the generator room.
HE2_AH   //  ~z~Always get the nut jobs on my shift!
HE2_DA   //  ~z~Shit, they must have took a wrong turn someplace!
HE2_AL   //  ~z~Where the hell did he go?
HEI2_5   //  ~s~All the generators have been rigged, get to the ~y~exit~s~.
HE2_AD   //  ~z~We got a light saying there's been a break in!
HEI2_25  //  ~r~The plane has been destroyed!
HST4A04  //  ~z~Hey, speak up, we can't hear you back here!
HST4A00  //  ~z~It seems impossible to keep a secret around here!
HEI2_50  //  ~s~Press ~k~~VEHICLE_ENTER_EXIT~ to jump from the plane.
HEI2_58  //  ~s~Charge placed.
HST4A08  //  ~z~He said fuck off
HEI2_11  //  Press ~k~~PED_FIREWEAPON~ to open chute.
HEI2_44  //  ~s~You're too high, you need to lose some height to make the jump.
HST4A14  //  ~z~OK, look, I'm going to go shut off the city's power source.
HST4A10  //  ~z~I live here.
HEI2_40  //  ~s~Get back on the ~y~dam quay~s~.
HEI2_10  //  ~s~ Go to the ~y~airport~s~ you're going to need a plane to parachute onto the dam quay.
HE2_BA   //  ~z~Any sign of him yet?
HST4A11  //  ~z~Oh, OK, you can stay.
HST4A15  //  ~z~Woozie, look after these fools for me.
HST4A01  //  ~z~I would have thought the size of the room would keep the numbers down.
HST4A05  //  ~z~I appreciate your input,
HE2_CA   //  ~z~What the f-Aw shit, somebody done locked the hatch!
HST4A09  //  ~z~Hey, what are you still doing here?
HEI2_28  //  ~s~Get back in the ~b~plane~s~!
HE2_AA   //  ~z~Hey, I found him, he's over here!
HEI2_20  //  ~s~This is all about stealth, if you get spotted or make too much noise the whole building will be alerted.
HE2_AE   //  ~z~That's the guy, arrest him!
HEI2_34  //  ~s~Get past the ~r~guards~s~ and find the ~y~entrance~s~ to the generator room
HEI2_61  //  ~s~Get clear of the ~y~area~s~.
HST2A13  //  ~z~Hey, hey hey hey! Damn, man - now he's seen the plans!
HE3_GE   //  ~z~Give me your number I have to see you again.
HEI3_19  //  ~r~You destroyed her car and the keycard!
HE3_GA   //  ~z~No more! You've broken me!
HST2A17  //  ~z~Now all we need to do is get one of those cards...
HEI3_15  //  ~r~The gimp got away!
HEI3_11  //  ~s~You're too close, back off before you spook her!
HEI3_05  //  ~s~Wait for the gimp to arrive, then take him out and take his place.
HEI3_01  //  ~s~The ~r~Croupier ~s~has a keycard and knows the code, follow her.
HE3_HJ   //  ~z~I'll call you, master, I promise!
HE3_HB   //  ~z~Oh! It's...
HE3_FE   //  ~z~Hey, if you good, I'll punish you more.
HST2A03  //  ~z~Alright, the cash room is on the bottom level.
HEI3_09  //  ~s~The ~r~Croupier~s~ has left the shop. Follow her but remember not to get too close.
HE3_CH   //  ~z~Cool, I'll see you at my house in a short while.
HST2A07  //  ~z~Hey, are you pointing again?
HE3_FA   //  ~z~Enough, master!
HEI3_25  //  Press ~k~~PED_FIREWEAPON~ to swing the dildo.
HEI3_21  //  ~s~The gimp is on his way.
HEI3_29  //  ~s~The Croupier is in here somewhere, find her.
HE3_DE   //  ~z~Hey baby, I'm a need that security card and entry code for Caligula's.
HEI3_93  //  ~s~The gimp has nearly reached the house!
HE3_DA   //  ~z~The door's open, Master!
HE3_EA   //  ~z~Where's the keycard?
HEI3_31  //  ~r~Something's spooked the Croupier!
HEI3_30  //  ~s~Leave the shop and go after the Croupier.
HEI3_34  //  ~r~You no longer have the gimp suit.
HE3_AA   //  ~z~Luckily, there's always one guaranteed weak link in any security set up.
HEI3_24  //  ~r~You failed to excite her.
HEI3_96  //  ~s~Park up outside the ~y~Croupier's house~s~.
HEI3_92  //  ~r~The gimp has reached the house!
HE3_DD   //  ~z~Oh I know! I know!
HEI3_28  //  ~s~You need to get her to give you the code.
HE3_CA   //  ~z~Wow, it's nice and tight!
HEI3_04  //  ~s~Go and get a ~g~gimp suit~s~.
HE3_CE   //  ~z~Oh hi, Benny...
HST2A06  //  ~z~Now, security consists of CCTV, a keycode access and, in places, a swipe card.
HEI3_08  //  ~s~The gimp will be arriving shortly, wait around and make sure he doesn't make it to the Croupier's house.
HST2A02  //  ~z~Hear me out on this, homie.
HE3_FD   //  ~z~Spit it out, filthy worm!
HST2A16  //  ~z~Alright, cool. This is a security card reader that Zero's sent over.
HEI3_18  //  ~r~You destroyed her car, she's not going to help you now!
HE3_GD   //  ~z~I know you're not Benny!
HST2A12  //  ~z~Hey boss, this arrived for CJ.
HEI3_10  //  ~s~The ~r~Croupier~s~ is almost out of sight, you need to get closer!
HE3_BA   //  ~z~Another shift over! See you tomorrow!

HEI3_06  //  ~s~Enter the ~y~house~s~.
HE3_CG   //  ~z~You got yours?
HE3_CC   //  ~z~Let's have a look.
HEI3_02  //  ~s~If you get too close you'll spook her, but if she gets too far ahead you'll lose her.
HST2A08  //  ~z~Oh, my bad - habit.
HEI3_16  //  ~r~You lost her!
HEI3_12  //  ~s~The gimp is about to get away, stop him!
HST2A18  //  ~z~Now I know you're blind, man - but you gotta see this.
HST2A10  //  ~z~finally get a crew in on this.
HST2A14  //  ~z~Well, then we've got our first recruit.
HE3_GB   //  ~z~Gimme the code, you worthless trash!

HE3_DF   //  ~z~Oh Benny, you minx!

HEI3_17  //  ~r~You got too close!
HE3_GC   //  ~z~God, you're good at this!
HST2A15  //  ~z~Come on in and shut the door.
HST2A11  //  ~z~Yeah, I know.
HST2A05  //  ~z~with access to the casino floors at either end of the complex. Alright?
HE3_FC   //  ~z~And now, gimme the code!
HE3_FG   //  ~z~Do your worst!
HST2A01  //  ~z~Is this just going to be extremely difficult, or next-to-impossible?
HST2A09  //  ~z~Ah, don't worry; it's good practice for when we
HEI3_03  //  ~s~She's gone into the ~y~sex shop~s~, follow her inside.
HE3_CB   //  ~z~I'm sure you'll squeeze in just fine!
HE3_CF   //  ~z~Yes, master, I'm just trying it on.
HEI3_07  //  ~s~The gimp's making a run for it, don't let him get away!
HST5A10  //  ~z~Exactly what I was thinking.
HE4_BK   //  ~z~Suspect is black male, about six feet tall, and medium build,
HE4_BC   //  ~z~Larry, some prick's trying your bike for size!
HE4_BG   //  ~z~All units, this is an APB for a serial patrol bike thief.
HEI4_02  //  ~s~Drive the bike onto the ~b~Packer~s~ truck.
HST5A08  //  ~z~What about the police escorts?
HEI4_06  //  ~s~Get another ~g~police bike~s~ for the job.
HST5A04  //  ~z~Bingo! Stripes for Mr. Zero here.
HST5A00  //  ~z~Alright, here's the plan. It's all about the art of deception.
HE4_AC   //  ~z~Now get out of here!
HE4_AB   //  ~z~Take care of those bikes.
HEI4_07  //  ~s~All four bikes have been safely delivered!
HST5A09  //  ~z~Whenever they move cash around they use police motorcycles as outriders.
HE4_CB   //  ~z~I'll steal the bikes and get them to you.
HEI4_03  //  ~s~Get back on the ~g~bike~s~.
HST5A01  //  ~z~While I get as much heat on me as possible,
HST5A05  //  ~z~Ha hey! Good job, you little ass kisser!
HE4_BJ   //  ~z~Suspect is black male, about six feet tall, and light build,
HST5A11  //  ~z~C'mon, come with me, and we're gonna go get some cop wheels...
HE4_BF   //  ~z~I'm at the hospital and, well, some joker's stolen my bike!
HEI4_13  //  ~s~There's the ~b~Packer~s~ up ahead. Drive up the ramp at a steady speed so it can be attached.
HE4_BB   //  ~z~and my bike's been stolen!
HST5A07  //  ~z~and re-spray it so it looks like one of their regular trucks.
HST5A03  //  ~z~Question: how does the Mafia normally move cash out of Caligula's?
HEI4_09  //  ~s~One more ~g~bike~s~ to go.
HEI4_01  //  ~s~We need to steal four ~g~police bikes~s~ and get them safely onto the back of a Packer truck.
HEI4_05  //  ~r~The Packer is destroyed! How are we going to deliver the bikes now?
HEI4_11  //  ~s~The Packer's circling the outskirts of town but you'll have to be quick, it leaves soon.
HE4_BD   //  ~z~Get him!
HE4_BL   //  ~z~Suspect is black male, about six feet tall, and heavy build,
HE4_AA   //  ~z~Okay, that should do us.
HE4_BA   //  ~z~Come in control; I was doing a walk-the-line on some drunk at the pizza place
HEI4_10  //  ~r~Out of time! The Packer truck has left!
HST5A12  //  ~z~Ha ha, tha... Ow... Ow?
HE4_BM   //  ~z~Oh, and a stupid haircut!
HEI4_08  //  ~s~Two more ~g~bikes~s~ to go.
HST5A02  //  ~z~Y'all get away with the green.
HST5A06  //  ~z~So, we're going to steal ourselves an armored car
HEI4_04  //  ~r~We needed all those bikes in good working order!
HE4_CA   //  ~z~You get the Packer, hit the Julius Thruway and keep moving.
HST6A08  //  ~z~they use to airlift heavy loads?
HE5_AD   //  ~z~Ha ha, yeah I guess. Alright, dude, I'm outta here. I'll see y'all later.
HST6A04  //  ~z~That way we can make some money too.
HST6A00  //  ~z~OK, we got the bikes. And Woozie's taken care of the uniforms.
HM5_8    //  ~s~Go to the depot and pick up the ~b~bank van~s~ using the helicopters winch.
HST6A14  //  ~z~Hey, don't look at me.
HM5_21   //  Use the camera movement controls to move the crosshair.~N~Press ~k~~PED_FIREWEAPON~ to fire.~n~Press ~k~~VEHICLE_ENTER_EXIT~ to Quit.
HST6A10  //  ~z~We could lift the whole truck and take them to someplace safe.
HST6A18  //  ~z~Yeah, thanks for that.
HE5_BD   //  ~z~I WILL open fire!
HM5_19   //  ~s~Steal the ~b~helicopter~s~.
HM5_11   //  VAN HEALTH
HM5_14   //  ~r~The van is stuck in an area the winch cannot get to!
HM5_10   //  ~s~Pick up the ~b~bank van~s~.
HE5_BA   //  ~z~This is a restricted area!
HST6A11  //  ~z~Then we need to steal a sky crane.
HST6A15  //  ~z~Or me.
HM5_20   //  Press ~k~~VEHICLE_ENTER_EXIT~ to use the gun.
HE5_AA   //  ~z~Heeey, CJ, you never cease to amaze me!
HM5_1    //  ~s~Steal the helicopter from the ~y~military fuel dump,~s~ the gates will open for a military vehicle.
HST6A09  //  ~z~Yeah, they call 'em 'sky cranes'.
HST6A01  //  ~z~Now, we just gotta get an armored van
HM5_9    //  ~r~You destroyed the van.
HST6A05  //  ~z~No, I don't want to get the crew caught up in some street level jacking - it could get ugly.
HST6A17  //  ~z~Yeah, Carl. It'll be just like fighting Berkley, only bigger!
HST6A13  //  ~z~No, me neither.
HST6A07  //  ~z~Have you ever seen those helicopters they use to lift heavy loads?
HST6A03  //  ~z~Why don't we steal one while it's on its rounds?

STP2_10  //  Perform the stealth kill by moving slowly towards the guard while holding ~k~~PED_LOCK_TARGET~ and then pressing ~k~~PED_FIREWEAPON~ when your arm is raised.
STP2_14  //  ~s~There are lots of shadows in this area to hide in. Hiding in shadows makes it difficult for a ~r~guard ~s~to spot you.
STR2A05  //  ~z~Hey, dude - you ever thought about
STP2_41  //  If the white blip on the radar that represents your position turns blue it indicates that you are in the shadows and are hidden from patrolling guards.
LOC2_CC  //  ~z~Hey, I'll catch you later.
STR2A09  //  ~z~How about if I get somebody to write something for me,
STP2_2   //  ~s~The ~y~main door ~s~is around the back of the mansion.
STR2A19  //  ~z~Damn - my shit was whack!
STR2A15  //  ~z~Madd Dogg's rhyme book?
STP2_30  //  ~s~You need to take the rhyme book back to OG Loc. He is at ~y~Burger Shot~s~.
STP2_34  //  ~s~To use the skateboard pick it up and select it from the weapons inventory items. Press ~k~~PED_ANSWER_PHONE~ whilst over it to pick it up if your inventory is full.
LOC2_AC  //  ~z~He moves like his bowels have let go...
STP2_38  //  To use the skateboard, select the it from your weapons inventory. Use the movement controls to steer the skateboard. Tapping ~k~~PED_SPRINT~ helps you pick up speed and ~k~~PED_JUMPING~ makes you jump.
STR2A20  //  ~z~C'mon, man. I'm hot, Like fire, All nighter, All righter, When I kick it, I feel I hit it...
LOC2_DC  //  ~z~Peace, homie!
STP2_39  //  ~r~Madd Dogg's personal security ~s~are patrolling the mansion. Do not use any guns on your way to the rhyme book - you will alert them. Use stealth to steal the rhyme book.
LOC2_AB  //  ~z~Yeah, look how this Tanner guy runs!
STP2_29  //  ~s~Use the skills you have learned to get past any ~r~guards ~s~on patrol and ~y~exit ~s~the mansion so you can get the rhyme book back to OG Loc.
STR2A18  //  ~z~Hey hey hey, it's OG Loc, homie, and I'm gonna kick it a little something like this...
STP2_7   //  ~s~The patrolling ~r~guards ~s~are shown on the radar by the red blips which point in the direction the security guards are facing.
LOC2_BB  //  ~z~Tanner, you suck ass!
STP2_3   //  ~s~The ~g~rhyme book ~s~is in Madd Dogg's recording studio.
STR2A14  //  ~z~Madd Dogg's rhyme book! From his home in the hills!
STR2A10  //  ~z~only they didn't know about it?
STR2A04  //  ~z~Hey, Carl - what up, man?
STP2_15  //  ~s~A ~r~guard ~s~is coming.
STP2_11  //  Press ~k~~PED_FIREWEAPON~ to perform the stealth kill.
STR2A00  //  ~z~Hey yo, when I come through up in the place, You don't want me to call with a gun in your face...
STR2A08  //  ~z~Shit, I ain't in the rap game, you know, that ain't my thing. But we'll have to think about something. Man.
STP2_19  //  ~s~If you walk straight past the ~r~guard ~s~here he will see you. Try crouching and walking past the bar to remain out of his line of sight.
LOC2_CB  //  ~z~Holmes, you ice cold, dude!
STP2_40  //  ~y~Exit ~s~the mansion and get the rhyme book back to OG loc. It's safe to use your weapons now, although it may be less risky if you use stealth to get past any ~r~guards ~s~on patrol.
STR2A12  //  ~z~I think I just might have found a ghost writer.
STP2_9   //  If you crouch while you move you will make less noise. Crouch and then target the ~r~guard.
STR2A16  //  ~z~Man, you said you'd help, Carl.
STP2_1   //  ~s~Go to ~y~Madd Dogg's mansion~s~.
STP2_5   //  ~s~The first ~r~guard ~s~cannot see you. This means you can sneak up behind him with a melee weapon and perform a ~h~stealth kill~s~.
STR2A02  //  ~z~Yo! That shit sucks! Damn!
STP2_13  //  ~s~A ~r~guard ~s~is patrolling the swimming pool area. Observing his route will allow you to work out how to get past him undetected.
STR2A06  //  ~z~getting a writer to help you out with this shit?
STP2_33  //  The ~r~guards ~w~are using silenced guns. If you manage to obtain one it will allow you to fire a gun without being heard by nearby guards.
LOC2_AA  //  ~z~Oh man, this sucks!
STP2_36  //  To stay hidden you have to stay crouched and walk past the bar.
STP2_32  //  Using the camera movement controls you can rotate the camera, this is for looking around corners and spotting enemies.
LOC2_CA  //  ~z~Hey Loc, I got what you wanted.
STR2A07  //  ~z~Yeah, I did. But who, homie, who?
STP2_16  //  ~s~Find a suitable place to hide before he spots you. Look for an area with shadows.
STR2A03  //  ~z~Hey, what's happening, Loc?
STR2A17  //  ~z~Hey hey heyeyeyey. I'll do anything, homie. I swear that. OK?
STR2A13  //  ~z~I'll become the reciter, all nighter, all righter!
STP2_4   //  ~r~Madd Dogg's personal security ~s~are patrolling the mansion. You do not have any powerful weapons, stealth is your best option here.

W2ALT03  //  ~z~What you mean, can I swim?
WUZ2_JC  //  ~z~Nothing, gotta stop freaking out...
WOO2@00  //  ~z~Hold on. You tryin' to tell me you can't swim?
WOO2@04  //  ~z~Look, CJ, I need someone from outside the Triad who I can trust.
W2ALT07  //  ~z~How you do that?!!
WUZ2_OB  //  ~z~Shit, could have sworn I saw something!

WUZ2_YH  //  ~z~I lost him, you see him over there?
WUZ2_KA  //  ~z~Shit, who's that?
WZI2_5   //  ~s~The route ahead is blocked but there is an underwater tunnel! You will have to dive and swim through it to proceed.
WUZ2_RB  //  ~z~He must be dead...
WUZ2_YD  //  ~z~Guys! Hey guys!

W2ALT01  //  ~z~What? Hey, man, quit trying to distract me!
WUZ2_JA  //  ~z~Must be hearing things...
WOO2@02  //  ~z~plus, I'm terrified of eels, and squid, and seaweed, and...
WZI2_38  //  Once you have lost the attention of the ~r~guards~w~ return to the surface to get your breath back.
WUZ2_SB  //  ~z~We picked him up again!
WUZ2_CC  //  ~z~We got somebody in the water over here!

WUZ2_BC  //  ~z~My mind must be playing tricks.
WUZ2_ZT  //  ~z~Hey, he's over here!
WZI2_C0  //  Press ~k~~PED_JUMPING~ to jump and climb out of the water.
WUZ2_ZP  //  ~z~He must have got trapped down there!
WUZ2_UC  //  ~z~Hey, who goes there?
WUZ2_PC  //  ~z~There's the bastard!
WUZ2_ZY  //  ~z~Damn gulls, I'm gonna shoot one!

WUZ2_ZA  //  ~z~Shit, did you see that?
WUZ2_QC  //  ~z~He's under us!

ZER1@18  //  ~z~No. I won the prize in the science fair. First prize, that is.

ZER1_FC  //  ~z~...Well done, Carl.
ZER1_AB  //  ~z~This is insanity!

ZER1@16  //  ~z~No, please. I never initiate violence.
ZER1@12  //  ~z~Ooohhh. Berkley.
ZER1@06  //  ~z~Homie, what you on? Whatever it is, you need to reduce the dosage.
ZER1_AC  //  ~z~All batteries commence fire!
ZER1@02  //  ~z~and the imminent collapse of my hopes and dreams.

ZER2@15  //  ~z~Well with that plane, we gonna go humiliate Berkley.
ZER2@11  //  ~z~contemplating my inadequacy, for nearly two hours.
ZER2_EA  //  ~z~Well done, Carl!

ZER3_AF  //  ~z~Fucking shit! It's packing!
ZER3_AB  //  ~z~Hey, is that, like for real?
ZER3@07  //  ~z~We're fighting machines, Carl, as much as this tank, or that chopper.
ZER3@13  //  ~z~I got the cops on my case,
ZER3@17  //  ~z~Sounds like a model 7, a 5:1 ratio, equipped with cannon.
ZER3_EG  //  ~z~Deploy the tank!
ZER3_BB  //  ~z~If Berkley's still alive, he'll be servicing his transmitters!
ZER3_HD  //  ~z~Curse you, Berkley, Curse you!

ZER3@16  //  ~z~What's that noise?
ZER3@12  //  ~z~All I want is a little peace.
ZER3_EB  //  ~z~Right, I'm going to go beat on that fool!
ZER3_EF  //  ~z~Meaning it's a trap!
ZER3_DB  //  ~z~What are you doing, Carl?
ZER3_JA  //  ~z~Man, you guys play hard!
ZER3@06  //  ~z~It is perfectly natural, Carl.
ZER3_AC  //  ~z~Oh man, ain't it cute!
ZER3_ED  //  ~z~Berkley is a master tactician, a cautious general!
ZER3@18  //  ~z~No, it doesn't. No it doesn't...
ZER3@10  //  ~z~Don't mind me, Carl. I am having an existential crisis.
ZER3@14  //  ~z~a big fat prick who betrayed me and you're having such a crisis?
ZER3_AE  //  ~z~Mother of God! It's blasting!
ZER3@00  //  ~z~What's wrong with you now?
ZER3@04  //  ~z~That with Berkley dead my life is also over.
ZER3_AA  //  ~z~Whoa, dude, a tiny war machine!
