FE401946     //  While in the employ of Elysian Fields Developments,
36698514     //  Louis Jan Buchwalter was killed when the roof
9E68F16A     //  of the property on which he was working collapsed.
1EF6DBEA     //  On Tuesday 28th January at approximately 8.30 in the morning,
65229050     //  Mr Buchwalter was ascending the roof structure of a property
4358770C     //  at the Normandie Avenue development when a fault in the
C2E077B5     //  ridge beam caused it to sag. Witnesses report
0DC494B1     //  that Mr Buchwalter slipped and attempted to right himself
BDB85259     //  by holding onto a ceiling rafter, but the rafter broke.
928DB842     //  Mr Buchwalter fell approximately 23 feet to the ground.
9303407F     //  His falling weight caused several ceiling joists to snap,
DC88B206     //  and these fell inward along with part of a
A81C170F     //  prefabricated roof truss.
A4895F9C     //  An autopsy later revealed that Mr Buchwalter's cranium was shattered, probably when he struck his head on one of the roof beams. He sustained significant internal injuries as a result of the falling timber, and died of internal hemorrhage approximately ten minutes after the initial roof collapse.
0CDAB87A     //  Independent testing of the ridge beam and roof truss has determined that faults in the timber were undetectable prior to installation. Witnesses report that Mr Buchwalter was following all safety procedures.
76C51E88     //  It is the opinion of this investigator that the death of Louis Jan Buchwalter constitutes a genuine and unavoidable industrial accident, and no fault can be ascribed to Elysian Fields Developments. The insurance benefits associated with this policy should be paid in full to the designated beneficiaries.

9CA7A27C     //  You expect me to reopen this case because you come in here walking that walk? Well, I'm not buying it. I think you should tell me what the hell is going on.
F1663431     //  You really want to know?
3B616C0D     //  Yes.
856F4A00     //  We were interned together on Ellis Island. Resident alien Germans whose parents had been killed by Nazis. Do you see the irony in that, Mr Kelso? We spent four years there.
01EB8217     //  I think you entrapped this Buchwalter hump. I think that's your game, sister. You're the bird with the broken wing type that all the guys feel sorry for. Buchwalter gave you everything, didn't he?

718DA5E0     //  Exactly what I said. I want that building thoroughly investigated.
E5CA7BA7     //  You expect me to believe that you have no ulterior motive? That money means nothing to you?
31DB3C35     //  I believe that money has value. I believe your work defines who you are, and you should be paid relative to the quality of your work.
F08F9307     //  I'm intrigued, Miss Lichtmann, I really am. 
746ACE6A     //  But you're going to have to give me something if you want me to get involved in this.
FE3DE808     //  There is a conspiracy surrounding Elysian Fields and the new houses they are building. 
0C412E56     //  I believe your insurance company is involved.
CF49EFB6     //  That's pretty heady stuff, Miss Lichtmann. 
937F4721     //  Flimsy, but heady.
DE7400A6     //  I've told you what I know, Mr Kelso. What are you going to do about it?
759BC3E4     //  There's some kind of intrigue going on here, Miss Lichtmann. You're not the agent of a foreign government, are you?
4EAFD804     //  I'm a German, Mr Kelso. 
54B8FEA8     //  We no longer have a government. 
E3BF2249     //  I am not a Soviet, unless you have some way of proving differently.
0A2F1D34     //  Mr Kelso, the greatest threat to America is not another way of life, but American naivety as to how other people live their lives.

E2949EF4     //  Phelps.
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
4C60D64D     //  I don't care what you did or didn't do, Phelps. 
26B177DD     //  I hear you're a good case man, 
35933E0F     //  but if you fuck up on my detail I'll have you out of here before your feet touch the ground. 
A72023B6     //  Do we have an understanding?
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
CDE58BE8     //  Cap, we don't want a fucking rat like Phelps...
9B74DA67     //  Can it, Tilden.
7867A7F1     //  Phelps, I'm partnering you with Herschel Biggs.
EA3DD5C7     //  I don't do partners. You know that, Cap.
9DB94D0E     //  You do now, Biggs. 
B19025C0     //  Social basket cases like you two should get along just fine. 
7E3D9920     //  Biggs will show you the ropes, Phelps.
515E29EC     //  This is Arson. There are no ropes.
1E8E7607     //  It shouldn't take long, then. 
3D2942C9     //  Start with these two. 
EB564D2A     //  House fires. 
1293654A     //  326 South Kenmore Avenue, Steffens family was out of town when it happened. 
1CA8693C     //  Then go to 4414 Rosewood, family by the name of Sawyer. Fire brigade will be on location.
BE9B711D     //  Are they suspicious, Captain?
570FF775     //  That's for you to find out, Detective.
063B905C     //  You have your assignment, Detective. Get on with it.
0981243F     //  You're in enough trouble, Phelps. Don't stand around here all day. You have your case.
89477661     //  Get lost, Phelps. You want sympathy, go cry to Brunhilde.
C4597811     //  Hey, I like your style. God knows I'd like to leave my old lady hanging in the breeze. Get the fuck out of here.
5C3E9034     //  You're a goddamn joke, Phelps. Get out of my face.
64DDCF01     //  You should be doing some work. You're still a cop. 
F8957CF4     //  Kind of.
9C10E820     //  Cars are round the back. Don't expect nothing too glamorous like you're used to, Phelps. Arson don't rate too high when the department's doling out its budget.
BCD747DD     //  I don't know what you've heard, Biggs, but my tastes are just as modest as the next man's. Long as it does the job.
D092DE87     //  Sure thing, hotshot.
4C4D8AC0     //  How long have you been working Arson?
D7A796CB     //  We going to do the small talk thing now? Talk baseball, exchange addresses? I don't think so. You feeling down, hotshot? Need a buddy? Well... look somewhere else.
EF0FC1FD     //  So this is how it's going to be, partner?
8742CAC5     //  I already told you, I don't do partners. I seen you on your first day, hero. Walking into the station with your chest puffed out like a little kid at his confirmation. You wouldn't have given me the time of day, and now you need somebody and that somebody is supposed to be me... well, it's not going to happen.
1FB25B05     //  That's quite a speech. I heard you were the strong silent type.
CF3A81A4     //  You cracking wise, Phelps?
F5F36AA8     //  No, Biggs. I'm breaking the ice.
17B2D07D     //  Just drive, hotshot.
64FA1A14     //  There isn't much left.
B0D40453     //  There never is if the job's done properly.
43515239     //  You think it was deliberate?
59130BCA     //  No. That's real pain in her face. They would have moved out the things they care about if this was insurance. There's no mileage in this.
F7DDB97C     //  Hello, Mike.
0172082D     //  Hey, Hersh. You cop this one?
C8BEF7A6     //  Yeah.
0A674911     //  Mike Branigan,
913403C4     //  Cole Phelps.
EF15DF5F     //  It's okay, Branigan. His name may be dogshit but there's none on his hand.
57CAD31C     //  No offence, Phelps.
0D74CC31     //  None taken. Do you have anything?
2D782D39     //  The fire started late last night. Steffens family were at Catalina Island. Won some kind of competition. Looks like the only thing they ever won in their lives and they come home to this.
9E883BD5     //  I'd say they were pretty lucky, really.
746E74D6     //  They don't have any insurance. Everything they own including the house is now that pile of rubble.
5D99F4BD     //  Where are they sleeping?
F6800823     //  In the car. It was lucky the whole block didn't burn down.
F5B52CAF     //   Word is they're bulldozing this whole neighborhood to build new homes for GIs.
47962E2F     //   That's the man of the house, in the ruins.
028D87DA     //   Teary lady is his wife.
5B056826     //  We'll take a look around. Come on, Phelps.
3020C03B     //  Recently serviced. Could be something to go on.
CAF81638     //  Mr Steffens? Cole Phelps and Herschel Biggs, LAPD.
049C89EF     //  I know it's a difficult time, but could we have a word?
F3E1532B     //  Don Steffens.
7ACA66F6     //  You were out of town?
CAF19A54     //  We won a prize. We had a wonderful time... came home to this.
C7EDCB22     //  Do you still have the tickets?
CE2F15B8     //  Sure.
816D8AB0     //  It's a formality, but we'll need to speak to the issuing agent.
2A6750C2     //  Can you tell me any more about the prize that you won, Mr Steffens?
54BE7B43     //  Weekend at Catalina Island. My wife got this flyer in the mail from the Suburban Redevelopment Fund.
F43E3ED1     //  Did you enter any kind of competition?
C39DCA7A     //  My wife filled in a flyer.
995DC17D     //  Lady just rung up and told us we won.
3A3F572D     //  It's the first time I ever won anything.
EDA01A8A     //  I'm sorry to have to ask you this, Mr Steffens, but was the house insured?
6EE060D7     //  No, it wasn't. I couldn't afford it and the house needed a lot of work.
A69AAA0A     //  You sure things didn't get a little too tough, and you burnt down the house yourself?
B797E6C0     //  I should punch you on the goddamn nose.
0247D8F1     //  You want to prove that I burnt my own house?
8E2012A4     //  You son of a bitch.
8B5718B4     //  If you're done with your questions I have a family to see to.
C177BE7A     //  The Redevelopment Fund. Did they offer to buy you out?
78240BB1     //  They're building new houses. They showed their money and most of the neighborhood just packed up and walked away. But I never bargained with them.
7B9D5741     //  But I never bargained with them.
25E23A97     //  GI houses?
F87214A2     //  Yeah. Something like that.
B9597ADD     //  Everyone else is selling, but you're the holdout, aren't you?
EE14A9C9     //  I was the last. I thought I could hold out for a better price. My house is the center lot.
0757A7FC     //  So now you'll have to take the price regardless?
B1A65878     //  Looks like it. I've got no choice. I have to put a roof over my family.
F6B25513     //  You're lying, Steffens. You wanted to sell. You just wanted a better price.
3C64828E     //  What I wanted was my own business, and you have no way of proving that I wanted to sell.
C28329F6     //  I'm done with you, lunkhead. I need to look after my family.
082D3CBF     //  That's all we need for the moment, Mr Steffens.
342FEC89     //  Alright.
30C22958     //  Mr Steffens, you're hiding something, and I can't get to the bottom of this until you give it up.
07F48263     //  We're done. My wife and my kids are waiting.
55493C9A     //  What's with him?
2B274DF3     //  You've seen the papers? I guess he's thinking about his own family. I'd say he's searching for some kind of atonement right now.
B4BBA0D1     //  I'll wait for the Fire Services guy. That's about all I can do here. You'd best get on with it.
A1522A59     //  No offence, Phelps, but it won't do anything for my career wasting time with a dirty cop.
14541560     //  Where are you going? You've got my full attention here, Detective.
FB944FB2     //  Not much more we can do here, Detective.
95C60487     //  We'll give the family some time, and then we'll start the clean up.
93374E8D     //  I'm here to put out fires. I can't really help with police work.
8F116AB0     //  I hate what's happened to these people as much as you do, but it's a police matter now.
E93B2CCE     //  We're packing up. We need to be on our way, Detective.
B411D4F6     //  Damn - this kind of thing breaks your heart, but we've done all we can do here.
3A68A0A6     //  I appreciate your help, Detective, but I need to see to my family.
EBB15EC1     //  I know you are trying to help, but I need to look after my own now.
5F4CD09E     //  You might have nothing better to do than stand around and stare, but I have a family to feed.
A0890CF4     //  Look, I'd appreciate it if we could get this over with.
5115D546     //  Get away from me, you heartless son of a bitch.
72E3659A     //  I'm sorry, Detective. I want to help but I... speak to my husband... I can't tell you anything.
0D4FDCA0     //  Our books... our photographs... our... everything... please, leave me alone now.
E596BF62     //  Have there been any other house fires?
C815DBED     //  This is Arson. We get an average of two a night. Does that answer your question?
09FD1EC9     //  I still want to check out the travel agent.
CAB75C50     //  Lead away, pin-up boy.
6E3E37B4     //  You heard of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund?
5D93F044     //  I've seen their billboards.
5496202C     //  Is it run by the government or by the city?
A5E0C7BE     //  Your guess is as good as mine. There's at least a half a dozen of these agencies throwing up homes for GI's. They did the same thing after the first war. What's your interest in these guys?
8C4F611F     //  We could hit the travel agent, or try this Suburban lead.
909B9A4E     //  Come in, come in, take a seat. Where can I send you today?
33E2504E     //  Detectives Phelps and Biggs. LAPD.

677AD013     //  Trip by flying boat to Catalina Island. 
C4A8FFE9     //  The tickets were issued last week and redeemed this weekend.
410B3B32     //  The Sawyer family. Rosewood Avenue.
C98D1914     //  We have reason to believe that the Sawyer family of 4414 Rosewood Avenue recently won a competition run by your company.
D9250C50     //  Yes, I remember them. They called up to cancel at the last minute. One of the kids was sick. Very unfortunate.
D7DC2C4B     //  Do you mind if I take a look at that?
295DB20A     //  Here they are. Steffens.
61308B5C     //  I'm told the tickets were a prize?
17F00333     //  Yes, they were.
35E16E73     //  You do a lot of these prizes?
46D4DDF4     //  Look, there are hundreds of these promotions running at any one time. If you're the lucky guy you get your name pulled out of a hat.
47BAD580     //  How does it really work?
FA4D611D     //  A company wants to promote a product. They send out flyers. A customer phones or writes in that they have the winning number. Simple.
3E37D405     //  While the Steffens family was at Catalina Island their house burnt down. You consider them lucky?
C66DBCD8     //  Christ... I'm sorry to hear that.
24F2062E     //  Can you tell me who offered the prize they won?
4AC2D89C     //  Sure. 
3871D9D4     //  Look, there's supposed to be some sort of supervised draw, with hundreds of tickets.
6BDEED54     //   But the reality is the Suburban Redevelopment Fund calls me every couple of weeks and tells me exactly who has won.
8672F88E     //  While the Sawyer family were supposed to be at Catalina Island their house burnt down. 
E2D47144     //  You consider them lucky?
0D96EA3F     //  Can you tell me who offered the prize won by the Sawyer family?
B02BB4D1     //  You're lying, Cunningham. There's some kind of racket going on here and you're in on it.
E1828B52     //  And you have a screw loose, buster. I'm involved in a conspiracy for a twenty dollar family ticket to Catalina? How are you going to prove that?
B112A813     //  You should go have a drink or lie down or something, get your mouth under control.
DC578BA4     //  Tell us about the Suburban Redevelopment Fund.
1EC6DAE9     //  There's not much to tell. They run a promotion. Our promotions mailing list covers half of LA.
41860CAB     //  So they are not a government agency?
5BE1151D     //  I don't believe so. 
D6D6424C     //  Government organizations don't usually get involved in promotions.
9CE569E2     //  So you don't believe that it's suspicious that a guy who doesn't want to sell his house wins some holiday tickets, 
B20E0A4A     //  and while he's away his home burns down?
C67F2610     //  To me it just sounds like really bad luck. It's not like everyone who wins a prize gets their house set on fire, Officer.
5992687D     //  How much business do you do with Suburban? 
88AF6A3B     //  You get some kind of kickback from these guys?
BEB436DC     //  Oh, so now you're accusing me of taking kickbacks from realty developers. You have some way of proving this, Detective?
5580D755     //  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black...
6BD525A2     //   cops accusing small business people of graft. 
EBD72BE5     //  I think we're done here.
B817C5CD     //  I've told you all I know, Detective. I need to get back to my work.
807E4DEE     //  If you don't mind I have my work to get back to. I don't have anything more to add.
FFDA5B21     //  I can see why cops never take holidays. They stand around all day with their minds on vacation.
9A2B0862     //  If I needed a mannequin for the store window I'd buy one. How about running along now?
995E2B98     //  Come back, Detective. There's more. I want to help if I can.
09ED72AB     //  It's probably best if you leave now. I've had enough of your accusations.
7916701E     //  Thanks for your help.
040616EC     //  No problem. I just wish I could do something for that family...
60E39EA2     //  You could put round the hat. A few bucks would really help them now.
992EB97D     //  I suppose so...
4528C658     //  Good, I'll put you down for fifty. I could tell you were a Samaritan the minute I walked in the door.
D6BDAFCD     //  Fifty? Are you...
6A6CEE78     //  Good man, Cunningham. You're alright.
FCB1E853     //  Yeah, I'm great. Poorer but great.
0D76C25B     //  We're going to look into this thing further, Cunningham. I hope it's all above board, otherwise we'll be back and it won't be pleasant.
00A597FD     //  You can't strongarm me!
104D735A     //  He can't. But I can.
7264D274     //  Why don't you call dispatch to get an address on the Suburban Redevelopment Fund? It's the only lead we've got.
25454354     //  I need information on the Suburban Redevelopment Fund.
5938AC97     //  Yes, Detective. Just checking... 
ACF4E99A     //  the Fund is a semi-government agency, established to speed up the building of GI homes.
C225595A     //   It has private investors, as well as a government endowment.
8AAA635B     //  Do you have an address for them?
2FFAD9CD     //  There is one listed here. Corner of Beverly and Mariposa.
B8888E4C     //  Let me guess... you want to check out the Suburban address?
8EA20B1C     //  Great partners must think alike, Herschel.
215E8602     //  This is supposed to be the registered offices of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund.
10B21F05     //  This is an Elysian housing development, mac.
ABF47CC5     //  So Elysian is an investor in the Redevelopment Fund.
9B734EDF     //  Looks that way.
E84782D4     //  Are we done here, mac? I've got work to do.
F2D5EBA6     //  Sure, buddy. Thanks for your help.
1D312AA6     //  There's not much I can tell you. Just that these Elysian boys pay good, and I don't ask questions.

E56279D4     //  While I'm here, my workers are probably putting their feet up and talking shit.

617D63A1     //  Hi, Albert. We've just come from the Steffens fire on Kenmore Avenue.
80CFD29F     //  Hi, Biggs. I was over there earlier myself... you have a partner? What gives?
13214B1E     //  Hi, Albert. We've caught this case.
846B1AE9     //  Hey, Biggs. We? You have a partner... what gives?
E4A7BC19     //  This is Cole Phelps. You may have read about him.
793B7CA8     //  Oh, now I get it.

7A1D0C81     //  It just isn't fair what happened to these folks, Officer. You get to the bottom of it.
AF21C3B9     //  We've all just got to... get on with life, I guess.
86D20860     //  Not so fast, Officer. I'm not done yet.

929F6966     //   Take a look around the yard and see what you can find.
FCAC3362     //  Phelps - the guy across the street... I've seen him before. He likes fires.
301D103E     //  Come on. You're not a fighter. You like to cook people in their sleep.

6A8954F2     //  Herbert Chapman.
32954EAF     //  So you like fires?

B0D5F55C     //  I don't want any trouble.
74CBC38F     //  Turn out your pockets.
960D8724     //  You're a naughty boy, aren't you, Herbert?
9DD1C6F0     //  I keep myself to myself.
2E1E9ED1     //  Cigarette in a matchbox gives you a five or six minute delay. You want more time, you use a mosquito coil. Don't you, Herbert?
30B1EAB7     //  You light this fire, Herbert?
532B6B8B     //  Hell no. I heard it over the fire radio. It sounded sweet.
04B3EAE5     //  When you've finished following your leads, come and see me at the fire station. I have a theory about this.
EF33BCC8     //  Will do, Lynch.
EAA6858C     //  Take this guy in. We might want him for questioning later.
7A854D1F     //  You got it, Detective.
3411E7DC     //  I haven't done anything! How about picking on someone else?
83076047     //  I just like the feel of the fire. Nothing wrong with that. Leave me alone.
24289BFE     //  Go on and walk away if you like. Suits me.
122DF5E9     //  I'll keep the crowd under control. You worry about the evidence, okay?
8B2F36AC     //  Check the place over, Detective. I've got it secured.
B2A0BFF4     //  Hey, come on. I was talking here.
49FBBD96     //  We're finishing. I suggest you do the same.
4738CFBC     //  It'll take days for this thing to cool off.
ADDD6F14     //  You want a fire put out, I can help. Catching crooks you need to do yourself.
9710D835     //  If you think this is suspicious you need to do something about it.
A7A6058B     //  I just point the hose, Detective. Lynch here is the guy with all the answers.
51537C81     //  It's a damn shame, but there's not much else I can tell you.
EF45B3A5     //  Mal.
326C232A     //  You're going to stick it out, Cole?
9D8D76C0     //  I'm going to try, Mal.
F9E3FDDC     //   What have you got?
335F899C     //  Family by the name of Sawyer.
E15C16AC     //   Mother, father and two kids.
2D6334C4     //   All in bed, from the looks of it, so I'd say carbon monoxide poisoning.
61F62675     //   The burns are superficial.
2EEB6A19     //  Mother, father and two kids. All in bed, from the looks of it, so I'd say carbon monoxide poisoning. The burns are superficial.
B4D50A81     //  Time of death?
7F37B3B9     //  I'd say about midnight.
5925CD4E     //   Anything more exact will take some time to determine.
89F4DBA3     //   Lynch tells me this has something to do with a faulty water heater?
C26E6C1D     //  Could be. 
3916C8A1     //  There's been a spate of problems with a particular brand. 
F2826397     //  I've got another angle in mind.
9E92AA40     //  You care to elucidate, Detective?
05EC1312     //   If this is a murder and not an accident, sharing information has helped us solve quite a few cases together.
CE08C99B     //  I need something concrete, Mal, before the Department gets wind of it.
412D13BB     //   I'm in Arson for a reason.
55E6C885     //  I feel sorry for your wife and kids, Phelps. Not for you. 
E99672F9     //  But you're a good case man, one of the best I've ever met. 
FD020C3A     //  I'll help in any way I can.
E6F735F1     //  Thanks, Mal. I'd say that's firm but fair.
2D3CA885     //  I hate fire victims. Let me get these people out of here, will you, Phelps?
0A62D489     //  Follow up on your theory and get back to me. I'll help but now I need to help these people.
D49BEF7F     //  Hey, back here, Phelps. This is one bridge you don't want to burn.
22E555D5     //  Think you could give me some space here, Detective? I'd appreciate it.
30C4425D     //  If you want any workable evidence at all, you better leave me to it.
A4EA8275     //  You'll get a report back at the station like you usually do. No point bugging me now.
3898ECA4     //  How much do you think I know? Lynch and Carruthers will have the juice for you.
1B2415FC     //  I'm just here to help police the bodies. I've got nothing for you.
0E5391B3     //  This is pretty grim stuff, Officer. You mind leaving me alone?
82BFC418     //  Why have you got such a hard-on for this case? If it is murder it's almost impossible to prove. 
8FF6FCF6     //  Fire doesn't leave much evidence. 
9F43DD6A     //  There's no percentage in this.
887BB444     //  I think it's more than one case.
8EC6B2C1     //  They're house fires, Cole. 
301D90B6     //  Accidents, heater fires, gas explosions.
0C071C8E     //  There's got to be a reason...
7858F5B9     //  The reason is you want to be a star again. Forget it. 
BC8054BC     //  Give it up, you'll feel better.
26CD4D5E     //  There's something to this. I know it.
5E974647     //  What are you talking about? Arson is insurance. It's always been insurance.
10580809     //  We still investigate the cases, Biggs. The people in this house are dead.
58EB01F1     //  I'm going to make this case.
9B55157E     //   I'm going to rub the Department's nose in it. 
1E3F12EB     //  Help me or stay out of my way. 
4FB97338     //  You got it?
37C5ACFD     //  Go soak your head, Phelps. This hero business is a full time obsession with you.
952AC602     //  Lynch says we should visit him at Fire Station 32.
C74EF9C5     //  Lynch is a legend. You should feel privileged. He doesn't let many people into the inner sanctum. Keep your mouth shut and you'll learn something about fires.
56348E03     //  We came as soon as we could.
7CD6DF9C     //  Who exactly is this guy Lynch?
C6B0841F     //  Lynch.
63049D83     //  Biggs.
5C1E7331     //  You two investigating the house fire on Kenmore Avenue as well?
7A790C1A     //  Yep. Why?
16612C61     //  I had a look around the place while I was out there.
76CCB133     //  Do you believe the fire...?
6023D48C     //  I deal in facts, Phelps.
1DE2ACDD     //   Evidence of an explosion. 
53DF5A83     //  No obvious sign of accelerants. 
3F1CF5F0     //  Wiring looks intact.
405A264D     //  Come and take a look at this.
A0B1FA5C     //  This the heater from the Sawyer fire, Al?
5C282A06     //  Yes, it is.
C073E56C     //  Looks like it was recently serviced.
7D83218D     //  I have a theory, and it's a theory only. I don't have enough evidence to prove...
BA1BA878     //  Al, if you say it's so, we're listening.
CD21C51B     //  Okay, Phelps. You're a bright penny. 
C59752F7     //  You have a gas supply, you have a bunsen burner as a pilot light, 
8B07FE83     //  you have a regulator valve and the balloon represents the gas expanding in the room. 
7FA58AEC     //  Now, the gas has to make contact with the mosquito coil to form an explosion. 
08452D00     //  Let's see if you can work out the chain of events.
263E8F90     //  Okay. I'll light your pilot and turn the gas on.
2F215ACA     //  Good, your regulator is in position.
F1A2C885     //  Gas doesn't appear to be getting past your regulator. Try reversing your valve.
891D643D     //  You pull the lever on the left to turn on the gas.
DC997441     //  The gas bubble needs to be next to the coil if it's gonna ignite.
E37BE7DF     //  Okay, so now you have the pilot lit and the gas is flowing into the room. The torch would have to turn off the gas supply first to put out the pilot light. Try that.
6FCC2F07     //  Okay, you're in business. Turn on the gas again and see what happens.
E03DB170     //  Wrong spot, Phelps.
45416D60     //  That won't do any good there.
61658AFC     //  Try again, boy scout.
A81B1872     //  Come on, Phelps. You need to get the arrangement right before we can reproduce the results.
31B6427A     //  So that's how it's being done.
C11CE261     //  Maybe. There could be a flaw with these valves. I've adjusted this one for our experiment, but you need to take it to InstaHeat and see what they say. Their headquarters is on North Harvard Boulevard, number 262.
3A7B7A82     //  Thanks, Albert.
3C0C52C6     //  You're welcome, Biggs. See you at the next show.
EA3C316E     //  Follow the evidence, son. That's all any of us can do.
315B0722     //  Can we move it along, boys? I've got a huge backlog of reports that I need to file.
A601A9B2     //  This is important, Phelps. Where are you off to?
FEB1AC00     //  Show?
B6B5DB50     //  The next fire. 
9DA13847     //  We should go to the factory and see how many of these things are going bang in the night.
8B9DBEDE     //  You know this Chapman character?
5FF9B34B     //  The guy's a freak. He loves fires. 
8D45AB76     //  He's the kind of guy that we'd like for a lot of things but we don't really have any credible evidence to pursue him with.
BB1259BB     //  New and improved model. They'll be selling these like hotcakes.
C3C53A33     //  Hello there.
8334A3C8     //  LAPD detectives, ma'am.
AC767C23     //  We need to speak to someone in charge.
76BA32A5     //  I see.
50DBA734     //  Well, duty manager for today is Mr Rasic.
EC0B756E     //  You should find him in his office.
E316E6C8     //  Can you please speak to the manager?
E615E767     //  I'm very busy, Detective. I'm also married, in case that's what you're thinking.
73D8878F     //  Hello? You don't need my help?
446011F3     //  Something I can help you with, boys?
59671A09     //  Detective Phelps and Biggs, Arson. 
36CA2884     //  We're investigating a couple of house fires. 
6DE1E506     //  What can you tell us about this?
0E644FA2     //  Pressure regulator from a Model 70. 
E316CAA3     //  Let me take a look.
6BF13B2C     //  We have a problem. 
3A7E46EB     //  This has been tampered with.
C3F372FB     //  What?
260A5B13     //  You see this diaphragm? 
7770992E     //  It forms a seal across the saddle here. 
72A75552     //  Gas flows across from here to here. 
A4764C5B     //  The diaphragm regulates flow.
D358F6BD     //  It's been reversed. 
D1C84636     //  It's a subtle change, but it means the gas never closes off properly.
48F0A2CC     //  So you're telling me that this is not a manufacturing fault or service repair.
B143C534     //  I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with the design.
1C4079D4     //  How many guys would know how to make that change?
176A49AD     //  All you need is a screwdriver and a wrench. Anybody could pull it apart and put it back.
AC6BF9EE     //  You're telling me that you've never had any problems with this heater?
DC0ECF9E     //  Look, we've changed the design since the Model 70.
1A2DD1CC     //  These things are still being installed?
0EA37BBF     //  It's the demand. None of us could keep up with the amount of housing going up. At the budget end we're still using some of the old stock. We are installing one hundred heaters a week. They're not all faulty.
F341E080     //  They're not all safe either.
2779C1CE     //  I think you're lying, Rasic. Either these heaters are flawed at inception or they were badly put together. Which is it?
6C9FFA3D     //  If you want to pursue that line of questioning we can have our day in court. I'll put my engineering credentials up against yours.
EE894416     //  We can try to get to the bottom of this error or we can make it confrontational. So what's it going to be, Detective?
68CAEB22     //  Are these diaphragms prone to failure?
387DE838     //  So the guys' names that I've been seeing doing the repairs on the heaters, they're fully licensed and accredited.
6AB818AE     //  Sure. Of course they are.
967050C1     //  They tend to go after a while. The rubber lasts quite a few years and then it perishes.
83F8DEA7     //  Could the switch have been done on purpose?
38C6798B     //  Yeah, I suppose it could. There must be easier ways to burn down a house though.
05A01595     //  You employ accredited mechanics to do this?
40F14698     //  We call them installers. Technically they're gas fitters.
23FDFB4E     //  Installers, then.
12D9178A     //  They know what they're doing, Detective, if that's what you're trying to imply.
669FC084     //  I think you're lying, Rasic. I think some of your men aren't fully licensed. You're desperate to cover your sales.
0F939593     //  And how are you going to prove that, Detective? Name me one of my guys who would have overlooked a fault like this.
2E65FCF8     //  What about Matthew Ryan?
8008B8D7     //  What about Reginald Varley?
E36D7216     //  You know about Ryan, huh? Alright... he's been in some trouble. I know that. He's done his time.
AB246222     //  You know about Varley? 
36EE5B72     //  He's on the run for a divorce interstate. It's not so bad.
06509D52     //  You in the habit of hiring criminals, Rasic?
94FE6326     //  I need guys, Detective. This boom is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
3C1B2E95     //  You're talking through your hat. My guys are alright.
63E90966     //  I want you to get me a copy of the list of your installers.
3C934365     //  Okay. I'll get it for you.
88BC8A8F     //  There. There are around a dozen of them. 
2634FD82     //  The housing business is going crazy at the moment.
222E43CD     //  This is a long shot. We are not going to roust that whole list.
46E9942F     //  I want to run it by R&I, cross reference for arsonists. 
B0A17C68     //  See if any of these guys have any previous. 
1D40C935     //  Sir, I need to use your phone.
0605A02D     //  Go right ahead.
2BF8FD02     //  Hope that helps, Officer.
4B82A5AF     //  I've got to swing by the shop, make sure the orders are coming off the line, so if we're done...
55B46D71     //  Uh... we can do this some other time if you're not feeling well.
6630A842     //  Hey, I thought you were here to talk?
248A44DD     //  You want my help, or you want to talk out of your ass? If you're not going to listen to me, I think that's enough questions.
61503214     //  Operator, give me Police dispatch.
C4C22D02     //  Putting you through now.
FA092A7B     //  I need to know if any of the following names have a previous criminal history.

4BCF0805     //  by Detroit Police Department.
592E1D14     //  Thanks. You've been a big help, young lady.
8FAF08C5     //  Do you have an address for Clemens?
8D81A335     //  Your employment roster is quite the rogue's gallery, Mr Rasic. Desperate times indeed.
E23D195B     //  He is working on an apartment building on Catalina and Third.
B488412D     //  What about Ryan?
F2E1857C     //  Currently working at a housing development on Normandie and First Street.
53DC4203     //  Varley. Where is he?
2399971B     //  Beverly and Mariposa, currently working on a new housing development. Hey, Varley is a good guy. You can't harass all my people.
5ED2829C     //  These guys have lockers?
4ED0425A     //  Yes they do, but my men have a right to some privacy. Don't you need a warrant or something?
099C4DE3     //  Show him and keep quiet.
EA76C8A7     //  Stick around, Mr Rasic.
D7118C56     //  Here. Happy now?
9654265D     //  My company went through thousands of these in the war. Still got eaten alive.
52050FEB     //  Varley has a problem with bugs?
74EDD4B9     //  You know that a mosquito coil takes an hour to burn down, Rasic?
8BC81F7F     //  No, I didn't know that.
473C69AB     //  It's the favored choice of ignition by arsonists. Gives them time to get away.
FC1C3EDA     //  You're crazy. He probably lives near the canals in Venice.
7CCFA5D1     //  Some light reading on the merciless capitalist machine.
65BE4AC6     //  Ryan wants the world to be a better place. Don't we all.
93CBC589     //  Clemens is a fellow traveler.
E6DEF5B8     //  Mind if I leave you to it? I got work waiting.
BDB0446C     //  Biggs, LAPD. We want some answers and we want them quick.
639E60F5     //  Okay, okay. What's this all about? Just tell me what you want.
F809B43E     //  You're licensed and work for InstaHeat?
F30B2815     //  I contract for them. So what?
D1D9E689     //  You did four years for burning down a house in Westwood. What are you doing working as a gas fitter?
DC418105     //  I did my time for that.
2B1CE1CA     //  InstaHeat hires arsonists, does it?
BAB4E3F0     //  I've worked as a fitter all my life. 
D0812FB4     //  I put everything I had into that house 
91DCC58B     //  and my fucking mud shark of a wife gets awarded it in the settlement. 
F195942C     //  She's blowing spics two at a time while I'm at work and she gets the house. 
2D1F4780     //  Yeah, I burnt it alright. I set fire to that fucker and watched it burn to the ground. 
E02C34AE     //  I did my time and I'd do it again.
21771813     //  Sorry about the roust, Clemens. 
23A1D569     //  You did the right thing.
9789B892     //  You like fires, don't you, Clemens? 
CA341C5B     //  You serviced the house on Kenmore Avenue. 
FE8B33EE     //  You manipulated the regulator valve.
D12A5658     //  I don't remember even working a job on Kenmore Avenue, much less sabotaging the place. 
356BCED1     //  What proof have you got?
3CD329CC     //  I do a day's work for a day's wage. That's what I do. 
EBB0EB13     //  You got a problem with that?
311235A2     //  Do you know Matthew Ryan?
618742AF     //  No. Don't know the name.
2FED08DB     //  He works for InstaHeat, Clemens.
696852C0     //  We get a job sheet and then we go out on the road. There's not much crossover between fitters.
4AE1C0CF     //  His locker is right next to yours. Give it up.
9D44E287     //  Okay, so I know Ryan.
499262D9     //  You and Ryan are fifth columnists?
B6531B36     //  And how do you figure that, wise guy? What proof do you have? You been following me to meetings?
9C75937C     //  We found a pamphlet in your locker, Clemens. We can add your name to the register. HUAC might want to interview you.
43FE10E0     //  That shit was from Ryan. He's always pushing that shit on people. Drives me nuts. He's got it in for the company.
361466AC     //  I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the Communist party. Nice try, copper.
29EB9D9B     //  You know Reginald Varley?
72293F52     //  No. Can't say I do.
B0CA8F5F     //  He's an installer with a criminal record.
82035120     //  Sounds like a bad hombre.
85737BD5     //  Detroit PD is after Reginald Varley for murder. You want us to run you in for aiding and abetting, Clemens?
E8548F71     //  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. All I know about Varley is he gets kickbacks from some developer. Does their work first, spreads it around if he can.
E3820B63     //  You have a real viper's nest at InstaHeat, don't you? 
8EAC2208     //  Arsonists, murderers and communists...
207AA9D5     //  What's that got to do with me? 
1A9D9FB8     //  You can't prove I'm behind all that.
510CBE6B     //  Look, I've been cooperative. How about letting me get back to work?
4291D128     //  You want to arrest somebody? Visit my ex-wife. Leave me alone.
7E09FB26     //  I've got a big backlog of these things to install. How about leaving me to get on with it?
DE414C6C     //  To be frank, you look like you haven't got a clue.
07D43F1A     //  Either of you two know how to do some soldering? You can't just stand around here all day doing nothing.
CA54F092     //  Wait, wait. Let's get this interview over with.
2D430552     //  You don't have anything to show in the way of proof, bub, so how about you just walk away?
9F155885     //  Alright, Clemens. You're off the hook for the moment.
CE77A902     //  Can I get back to work now?
A2DE917B     //  Let's get out of here, Phelps. He ain't our guy.
89C86196     //  Clemens, for someone with your record I would expect a little more cooperation.
FE2353DA     //  If Varley is on the run he might be packing heat. If he's wanted for murder, I say we take the doubt out of the equation and let him have it.
1F344ABA     //  You nervous?
6DA41879     //  It's been a while.
F5A54062     //  You were in combat...
4252C29C     //  In 1917. You know, I've never fired my weapon in the line of duty.
5BEC88A1     //  That's nothing to be ashamed of. I hope your piece is still serviceable, Herschel.
34ECA86B     //  I may be old and out of practice, but I'm still a Marine, Phelps.
6733A619     //  It would be better for our case if we could bring him in, Herschel.
61517082     //  LAPD, Varley.
56A33B1D     //  Why did you run from us, Varley?
1907CF37     //  I'm going to take a wild guess that you're the same Reginald Varley 
0A84D047     //  the Detroit Police have an outstanding warrant on. 
FC5BCDF2     //  How am I doing so far?
2FDE6849     //  I need a lawyer before I talk to any of you.
6A0CB6B0     //  Reginald Varley, you're under arrest for committing a series of arsons. You're also under arrest for murder. 
AF5B5713     //  Detroit PD will be putting in a request for your extradition. 
EF6D487C     //  Until then, you're a guest of the city.
482A372B     //  Arson? You can't hang that rap on me.
06BDF856     //  Be quiet. And be thankful we don't shoot you.
88426D29     //  Are all the cops in this town crazy?
3A50143D     //  Take him away, Officer.
F738C1F6     //  Are you Matthew Ryan?
B5A5C072     //  Who's asking?
818AC1AC     //  Detective Phelps and Biggs. Arson Squad.
E215BD1A     //  Arson?
A404D8C7     //  You heard the man.
58AD5242     //  I'll just put this stuff in the car and I'll be right with you.
117BCEE0     //  Hold it, Ryan... I said...
73CC11E2     //  Son of a bitch...
D7141A1F     //  Why did you run, Ryan?
41D1D9E0     //  I was scared.
47F43DB7     //  You got a reason to be scared, Ryan?
93C60D31     //  Matthew Ryan, I'm arresting you on suspicion of committing a series of arsons.
07CB35B6     //  Sir, I'm ready for the interviews.
50611E9D     //  Wrong. You've still got suspects on the lam. Now get out there and finish the job.
A370E820     //  I have two suspects.
F28052E8     //  Phelps, you got nothing. Biggs, Ryan is waiting for you in Interview One. Varley's in Two.
6B8D479D     //  Hey, Hopkins - you practicing your asshole routine again? Come on, Phelps.
695E0CEC     //  You clowns ought to be getting on with it.
541AD5C0     //  Don't you have suspects and hot leads waiting on you?
7039E632     //  Save yourself some time and get this thing off your chest.
76131898     //  If that's your opening gambit, you better try again.
C5F8C587     //  You have a history of violence?
D5A7A274     //  I have no such thing.
95540FDA     //  You were charged with attempted murder, Ryan.
EBF4423D     //  It was a court case. 
5251BCA9     //  No criminal liability was the verdict. 
BE149AD4     //  They said that they couldn't have known that the faulty heater installation would cause a fire. 
63BDA0AF     //  All I know is I lost my whole family... and the company that was responsible got away with it. 
7111CB71     //  What would you do?
A7386370     //  Which company?
46591F2F     //  Hephaistos Water Heater Company.
7A5EA5AB     //  You want to overthrow the system, Ryan?
A01FD03F     //  The system needs overthrowing.
61A33399     //  Regardless of who gets hurt?
FB4E2DDC     //  What do I care about who gets hurt? 
765B0468     //  Nobody cared about my family. 
E5416497     //  You want to make an omelette you gotta break a few eggs.
C7169818     //  I don't believe you, Ryan. 
5957303E     //  I think you are using your personal circumstances as an excuse. 
D8EF72ED     //  This is some kind of industrial vendetta. 
C38D9CC7     //  And how exactly are you going to prove that?
F402DDC5     //  You're going to have to do better than that.
FE1E556E     //  You know how to reverse a diaphragm in the regulator valve of a Model 70 heater?
8BE7E949     //  No, I don't.
6C45F87B     //  Seems a pretty basic repair.
C8D94C0E     //  Those things are sealed units.
902C9C1E     //  You expect me to believe that, Ryan? 
3DE75880     //  I could do it myself.
D13F1DAC     //  Believe whatever you want, flatfoot. You're part of the conspiracy.
D1B1ABD1     //  If you know enough to do your job, you know enough to do that repair. You're lying, Ryan.
98C2F64C     //  You're lying, Ryan.
F6E423CC     //  And how do you think you can prove that?
6FA28A14     //  Your boss at InstaHeat said that you've all been trained to do it. It's a common repair. 
EC992234     //  Are you calling him a liar?
9CD61D4F     //  Okay, so I know how it's done. 
B014BDA6     //  But what would be the point? 
B3062D4A     //  You'd just end up with a gas leak and then a small fire when you turned the pilot back on.
370F316B     //  And if you didn't reset the pilot and the gas spread?
E12928CE     //  And if you didn't reset the pilot and the gas spread? What was the cause of the fire in your own home, Ryan?
F1AA85C3     //  What was the cause of the fire in your own home, Ryan?
E8F8824D     //  I won't tell you.
5AA5AD6D     //  Looks like you're the one who needs advice on how to do his job.
5078DC6B     //  So you want to change the world, Ryan?
1C0066C4     //  Yes I do. So does every reasonable person.
B8CC1B97     //  And you're doing your part?
9801773C     //  Yes I am.
31458096     //  Does that include sabotaging water heaters to destroy a company?
2453C075     //  I have no idea what you're talking about.
9FF18591     //  So InstaHeat is to blame for all of your problems?
A5D92C6A     //  I didn't say that.
676BBF32     //  Last chance, Ryan. You level with me or I'm sending you to the DA. A conviction for sedition and murder will do wonders for his re-election campaign.
07A043CD     //  Nice try. But I've got nothing to lose.
2390950E     //  This is industrial sabotage, Ryan. It's all part of your campaign.
891BAB70     //  You're delusional, Detective. What campaign?
733D8D06     //  Your locker is full of pamphlets. Clemens told us how you were always foisting them on people.
1009FFCA     //  Sure, I spread the pamphlets. 
0E41A759     //  A guy has to do something. 
E9904690     //  InstaHeat heaters break down every day. 
169A549A     //  They're still peddling the same lousy design that they lifted from Hephaistos.
B1595770     //  InstaHeat bought out Hephaistos?
77C5C6F2     //  Them, Vulcan, Pyro and a bunch of other companies.
5811E712     //  And you still work for them?
76C7D110     //  A guy has to work.
B1457C1E     //  And the directors of the company? How do you feel about them these days?
69B6E550     //  You work it out.
CC6CAB05     //  So you know just what I'm thinking, as well as what I'm supposed to have done? Gimme a break.
1E8189C9     //  What can you tell me about the Suburban Redevelopment Fund?
8DB2BE8C     //  Nothing.
13AE5928     //  Let's change the subject. 
E0AAF247     //  You ever visit Catalina Island?
1739A562     //  I went there for my honeymoon.
3C9BACA8     //  I think Suburban is a front for your anarchist buddies. They're arranging for people to be out of town while you burn their houses down.
A068B1F5     //  Suburban? What's that got to do with me? That's Varley's bilk. He's the one with the cozy agreement with those fascists.
F18DC2DF     //  Tell me the truth, Ryan. It's the only chance you've got. You're getting some kind of kickback from the Fund.
ED4F495B     //  So I'm an agitator for change, but I take kickbacks. How does that make any sense?
FDAFD91E     //  You're just a stooge. A brownshirt for your capitalist paymasters.
D47BED69     //  That's it for the moment, Ryan.
6B95206E     //  So I can go?
6F9F58A1     //  Sure. As soon as your Red friends storm the building and carry you out. You'll keep your seat until we decide how long to lock you up for, knucklehead.
E63CCBAE     //  I'm arresting you for the murder of the Sawyer family and the arson of the Steffens residence. I hope your organization pays for a good lawyer. You're going to need it.
3F21549D     //  Speak to my lawyer. I got nothing more to say.
8AD56C3E     //  Buzz off. Your face is starting to annoy me.
4F475D3F     //  I can wait just as long as you can.
0A969951     //  Do you think you can sweat me like this? Keep dreaming, copper.
A7B978B3     //  Now you've got nothing to say? Well, I'm not done.
26DD5398     //  You need to turn around, go upstairs and tell your fascist bosses to go to hell. I'm not saying another word.
D2D9E551     //  We have Matthew Ryan in custody, Varley. I think all we need to do is ask him about this, and he'll rat you out.
2CF80506     //  Fuck Ryan. That pinko bastard.
7D2388A8     //  Word is you're in the pocket of some property developer?
D652D07F     //  Never. I got principles.
45AF7184     //  Varley, you're already wanted for murder. 
2266518F     //  I'm investigating an arson. That's all I'm interested in. 
47803369     //  Just tell me the truth.
50FAF359     //  I know cops. 
AE4BB9E1     //  You're trying to trick me into something.
822F3E13     //  Last chance, Varley. You're already a wanted man. 
6D8E579D     //  It won't be hard to hang a double arson on top of your murder beef.
3B5BF09F     //  Hey, I shot a loan shark who was squeezing my brother for the vig.
0A1DE1F1     //  That's why you ran?
B403ED50     //  I ran because the guys who ran that racket will kill me.
3FC3898B     //  How did Suburban put the squeeze on you? Did they find out about your record?
AEF00D16     //  There's no way you can link me to Suburban. You're wasting your time.
C475B841     //  Clemens says you offered to cut him in on the kickbacks they were offering. He'll testify in court.
E8426F14     //  Ryan says you offered to cut him in on the kickbacks they were offering. He'll testify in court.
FAD1C44E     //  Suburban - they got real time pressure in getting some of their big developments finished. There's some big date that they can't afford to miss. So yeah, I took their money. But so did a lot of guys, alright? Carpenters, electricians, plumbers. It's no big conspiracy.
496243B4     //  What'd I tell you? This is stupid. Now, when am I going to be able to get out of here?
73CAE8EB     //  What would reversing the diaphragm of an InstaHeat Model 70 do?
628644CB     //  Yeah, I've made that mistake before. You get a big bang when you turn the pilot back on.
303FF24A     //  So you didn't deliberately sabotage the water heater at the Sawyer house?
469D274E     //  No, I did not. Are you out of your mind?
2301CDA2     //  Somebody did, Varley. I bet Ryan and Clemens are happy pointing the finger at you.
DDBF7083     //  They can point all they like. I didn't do it.
5BC75A93     //  Give me something, Varley, or I'll put it all on you.
90301680     //  Hey, look, I could try and pin this on one of the other guys but I'd just be making something up.
80EFD7A8     //  I don't believe you, Varley. I think Suburban want some homeowners who don't want to sell out of the way.
60CB5795     //  I think you're out of your mind. Where is the evidence that I have done anything to contribute to this fire?
C05D532A     //  Arsonists use cigarettes and mosquito coils as time delay fuses. We found an open box of mosquito coils in your locker.
F6CC4788     //  Hang on! 
4D386557     //  Those things, they belong to Ryan, alright? 
BF0FCF28     //  He asked me to hold them because his locker was full of stupid pamphlets. 
42E3F3E3     //  I thought he used them for camping.
67635CC0     //  You're saying I'm some kind of psycho for hire? It's not true.
26DF8846     //  Have you ever worked on a place on Rosewood Avenue? Family by the name of Sawyer.
678B55B4     //  Maybe... I'm from out of town. I go where they send me. I don't do a lot of repairs, though. I'm flat out on new installations.
ADE666E9     //  So you're denying you worked on the house?
9F4C293D     //  No, I'm not. I'm saying I don't remember every single detail of every place I've worked.
32B9D0DC     //  Varley, I can hand you over for extradition now or you can give me something. What's it going to be?
D78265D4     //  I'm giving it to you straight. I've told you all I know.
E07499C9     //  Why are you lying to me, Varley? If Suburban wants their new installations completed, why are you bothering with wrecks like the Sawyer house?
5DE29B71     //  So I'm lying, just because I can't remember if I was there or not? How can you prove that I was?
E61ACD71     //  Your name is on the inside door of their water heater.
ECBCEAB2     //  Okay, you got me there. 
E444F024     //  Suburban, they wanted that guy out.

4DA76F2A     //  How is that a case?
4B128382     //  The broad says she was doped and that somebody tried to kill her.
901EEFFB     //  Where did this take place?
BB875D2F     //  That's the bit you're gonna love. Right across the street.
C3F372FB     //  What?
3D55099F     //  A Chevy Styleline took a nose dive off the escarpment, 
0D319C84     //  fetched up underneath a Cola King billboard. 
C82D8171     //  Hop to it, boys. We got bad guys to catch.
13F5801C     //  That's it. Now you know as much about it as I do.
13006A8E     //  Well, get moving. There's probably nothing to it, but you never know how these things play out.
628EC131     //  Phelps, Traffic.
5B50AF3A     //  Detective Phelps. Hey, Bekowsky. Long time no see.
4425038F     //  You could have called this in by megaphone, Enrique. 
0D064DAC     //  Phelps, this is Enrique Gonzales. 
551B8296     //  Enrique was a pretty decent middleweight.
38CE97D9     //  What do we have, Gonzales?
775E409B     //  Broad drives right through the empty lot and off the side of the escarpment. Her story is that a movie producer doped her and her friend and sent the car over the cliff.
0D70EEC2     //  Was anyone hurt?
716AF547     //  The driver is beat up but not too bad considering. 
772449C1     //  If she hadn't hit that billboard we'd be scraping both of them off the pavement. 
F98375DC     //  The passenger is a Jessica Hamilton - she's just a kid. She's pretty knocked around.
C282F2D4     //  The kid gonna be alright?
AA7B6C76     //  I think so. They've taken her to Central Receiving. If you want to take a look around, I can stall the ambulance.
0D69D2C4     //  Thanks. Do that.
20D27928     //  One more thing: watch out for the driver. 
77A0B986     //  She cuts rough.
5EE98FDC     //  Where are you going? You want my report or not?
28BD8A66     //  Hey, Bekowsky, is Wonder Boy always like this or does he listen to you?
E4A47281     //  What more can I tell you, Detective? Try the coroner. He's down the hill.
74759C0C     //  I got nothing else. You'll find out more from the coroner.
04071221     //  You'll want to see this, Phelps. There, laid out on the trunk. And that isn't even the best part.
5175F6EE     //  Drunk driver?
24CA507F     //  Maybe not.
8B2B012F     //  How so?
3CB7C006     //  Well, a head I found without a body piqued my interest. See what you think.
A87BD9EF     //  Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio. 
AE27133D     //  Is it real?
10ADBB83     //  No. 
F7023734     //  I think it's supposed to be a replica of an Indian shrunken 
DC7EE571     //  head. It's some kind of curio or movie prop. 
4BBBACBB     //  See the casting marks?
FC783F52     //  What's it made from?
4B5E0A13     //  Plaster of Paris would be my first guess, then painted.
CCE7C9AF     //  So we can rule out the murder angle?
69BE2279     //  No, you can rule that in. 
2ED51E7B     //  That thing was wedging the accelerator to the floor. 
EEBB5C32     //  Whoever did it wanted these women dead.
B3DC060A     //  Looks like they're lucky they weren't more badly injured.
9D9CD44D     //  Must have been unconscious. Being relaxed tends to lessen the soft tissue damage.
935361C6     //  They've been torn off. Where did you find them?
084CA150     //  They were stuffed in the young lady's handbag. I'll run a trace for semen when I get back to the lab.
F1DCFA94     //  She's a long way from home.
97F2A436     //  No interest in evil spirits and voodoo, Phelps?
E4A2C249     //  Are you a rubbernecker or an investigator? You sure you have everything?
0BD4C3FC     //  If you don't mind I'm about done here, Detective, and I have other cases to deal with.
FBCA7BF6     //  I suggest you interview the young lady when she is conscious.
C9D8EB21     //  There's not much here to go on. Let's talk to the driver.
DA2115AE     //  Her face looks familiar...
36244B34     //  Well, that's June Ballard. 
EDEBB4BC     //  Tarzan's Sister, Beast of the Amazon. 
82BF0689     //  She's married to Guy McAfee. 
6726075E     //  The Captain has moved to Vegas now, but the two of them still have juice.
BF8BC161     //  Mrs McAfee, we would like to ask you a few questions, if that's okay?
74C4061D     //  I prefer to use my maiden name, June Ballard. You might be familiar with some of my work?
B1C899C4     //  Can you tell us what happened here?
31C03805     //  You're kind of cute for a cop. Maybe a bit on the serious side.
E0DB99F3     //  And what about me, June? I'm a big fan of Beast...
FD54C16F     //  You, I don't like. Keep out of this.
B9612BBF     //  We understand that you're still suffering from the effects of the accident, Mrs McAfee. The officer says that you claim that you were drugged. Who did this to you?
64900D13     //  That rat slipped us a Mickey Finn. 
A45FC335     //  It's no wonder I feel so dopey. 
CFEC21E9     //  I can't remember.
C9B4BA59     //  Who drugged you, Mrs McAfee?
4AD823F5     //  I told you to call me June... you're making me feel like an old lady. And don't bother your handsome head about this. My husband will settle the score with Mark Bishop.
90BB957B     //  I don't believe you, Mrs McAfee, the story is too far-fetched. 
BC873DB0     //  I think you were drunk and lost control of the car.
28B04015     //  Well I suggest you get the results of a blood test first, before you go shooting off your mouth. Unless you have some other proof.
674B8F8F     //  Well, I could drink you under the table any day of the week and still be fine to drive home. Be careful. I'm starting to dislike you.
D43D1BA5     //  It's a serious offence to withhold information from the police during a criminal investigation, madam.
E739FF4B     //  You really are cute, Detective. But a little too naive for my taste.
0FC77B18     //  What can you tell us about the passenger in your car?
7ED36D0E     //  Jessica Hamilton. Poor Jessica. It's been a rough day for her. She's desperate to break into movies. What more can I say?
B0210211     //  And she's your protégée?
019DD8EB     //  You could say that. Yeah... that's a nice way to put it.
1BBCD146     //  How old is Jessica, Mrs Ballard?
E2B1A1BE     //  I couldn't say how old Jessica is. 'Old enough, sweetheart' as the saying goes.
9FF1373D     //  I think you're lying, Mrs McAfee. I think something happened to Jessica yesterday before the crash.
EA4D2A5A     //  I'm offended, sunshine. Do you have any proof?
258DEB16     //  I didn't think so. You should be more careful. Behind the glitz, this can be a very rough old town.
50E73CC9     //  Miss Hamilton's underwear were physically torn from her body.
08EE1D28     //  She wanted to go to a casting. I took her to a casting. Whatever happened after that is between her and Mark Bishop.
B4F4A533     //  We found a shrunken head. 
22E4E002     //  It was used to tamper with your car.
3145A5CE     //  You see, I normally don't drive off cliffs. The last thing I remember is getting behind the wheel.
E2F5CF75     //  You don't remember where the head came from?
59EDBC06     //  I don't know anything about a head. 
7CE04A5E     //  Why is everybody talking about a goddamn head? 
3A949517     //  Isn't anyone interested in how I am?
1BD36D62     //  It's obviously some kind of movie prop. You must know where it came from.
C409A433     //  In case you hadn't noticed, I am the talent. 
9D9A5389     //  And the talent doesn't deal with props or sets or any of that kind of stuff. 
36144997     //  Why don't you ask Mark Bishop which prop house he uses?
67808C76     //  Mrs McAfee, you're lying. Wasting our time. You know what's going on here - you just won't tell us.
C828750D     //  You're sweet. But simple too. The burden of proof is with the law.
AFFC815D     //  You should run along now. Don't worry yourself. This will all get sorted out. This is the way things get done in Hollywood.
E380F7F6     //  You mentioned a Mark Bishop. You think he might have had something to do with this?
250266CA     //  He's a movie producer. As for his involvement, you just leave it to me and my husband to worry about.
5199D977     //  I want to know what happened between you two that made him want to commit a double murder.
B472EBF5     //  Bishop offered me a part in his picture, then he withdrew it. Fact is, we had a deal. I pressed him on it and this is where I end up.
308EDBF3     //  It's not going to play that way, Mrs McAfee. 
B2BFB156     //  We'll take it from there.
E440848C     //  Relax, Detective. 
C08C60E9     //  You're not nearly as cute when you're mad.
D277A188     //  That's a lie and you know it. 
74EFFC3B     //  This goes deeper than that.
98F649A5     //  I'm sorry? 
9CF6813A     //  Maybe you'd like to go ahead and prove that, honey.
C6B2D6CC     //  I'm in pain here, Detective. I nearly died. 
A469992E     //  And now you're throwing these stories round here like they're facts?
2D9735E1     //  Mrs McAfee, I think it would be in everyone's best interest if you accompanied Patrolman Gonzales back to the Receiving Hospital.
68B410F0     //  I'm being taken in?
74D19100     //  You could say that.
424CBFE3     //  On what grounds?
DA4F48D2     //  On the grounds that you are under the influence of narcotics and that you are withholding information from the police.
94DF1224     //  My husband is going to want a word with you, Sonny Jim.
DA8BD6EB     //  I'm going to be okay. These guys can take me home after my lawyer and I have talked to the newshounds.
3ED6D3B5     //  Mrs McAfee, you are still under the influence of narcotics and you are likely to go into shock once the drugs wear off.
1F3BBFFC     //  And I thought you were a heel. It's nice of you to be concerned.
756ECD5F     //  You were giving me a thorough going over. 
613DC196     //  I was just starting to enjoy it.
748F4030     //  Speak to my attorney. He swats cops like you like flies.
CAC01B9E     //  Obviously you're a little green at how things work at the studios.
0B301244     //  Do you get paid by the hour for doing nothing?
7450E1E6     //  I'm done with these foolish accusations. Get out of my sight.
A2FF9EE9     //  They told me to wait on the detectives, but I can't hang around forever.
E975A4D2     //  Hurry it up, pal. What if someone gets hit by a bus while I'm standing here?
36571221     //  You goddamn idiot! What was that for?
07108333     //  I'll put you in a jacket and haul you to Sawtelle, buddy!
5524F37D     //  Patrolman Gonzales was the first on the scene. I'm just keeping the place secure.
459D42E6     //  Amazing. They both got out with just a scratch.
622DDB99     //  Coroner's at the bottom of this track, vic is with the ambulance.
9176C147     //  Officer Gonzales has the skinny. You spoken to him yet?
764173D4     //  If you're looking for the coroner he's down by the crash site.
EFD2F0CC     //  You see the broad who bombed over the cliff? They say she's a movie star.
B7B6F60E     //  I ain't the guy you want to talk to, Detective.
35528DE4     //  Hey, car's at the bottom, broad's at the top. 
5D237D76     //  That's all I know.
7432543C     //  Uh... I don't really know too much, Detective. Maybe ask the coroner.
3B8201E4     //  Funny how that thing at the railyard turned out, don't you think?
61D317A2     //  Hey, outta the way, bub.
3AC5AC3B     //  This ain't the red carpet, so get outta my lens.
3FEF9185     //  Hey. Don't be so hasty, Phelps. There could be more to this.
BB81C3AC     //  I think we're good here. Let's go see what we can shake out of the kid.
7235B137     //  KGPL to car 11K, 11 King. 
25CEC2A0     //  The car crash victim has regained consciousness at Central Receiving Hospital.
6A63EE49     //  11K roger. En route.
1649CCAC     //  Are there any messages for me?
666C7225     //  Yes, Detective Phelps. Car crash victim Jessica Hamilton has regained consciousness in Central Receiving Hospital. She's ready to be interviewed.
AB44DADE     //  I need an address on a Mark Bishop.
4CDD3555     //  Just a second... Mark Bishop, movie producer. Address is 2701 Wilshire Boulevard, Westlake Park.
6C6B3454     //  Boys, your victim has come around. She's sitting up in bed next door.
72B03386     //  Hello. Detective Phelps. Here to interview a Jessica Hamilton.
49C7D7C2     //  Jessica Hamilton. 
3EA41753     //  Oh yes - she's in the room right behind you, Detective.
AA5ED18A     //  We have patients to deal with.
1F51F4CF     //  Do you want to interview the patient or don't you?
3C99B454     //  I'm sorry, did you need something from me?
F659369F     //  Hello, Doctor. I'm Detective Phelps. You're attending to the young lady from the auto accident?
40E9785B     //  Yes. She's conscious now, but I doubt she'll remember much. 
C709CA6F     //  She's still feeling some of the after effects.
6DFF95E1     //  Jessica was drugged?
DEEEAC56     //  She certainly was. Chloral hydrate would be my guess. And there's clear evidence of abuse. She is still a minor, Detective.
AD0CBC40     //  Someone planned a double murder to cover up a statutory rape? Swaps seven years for life, and gets Guy McAfee on their case. Doesn't make much sense to me.
C0A90DA1     //  I guess it depends on what they have to lose.
B23CA83B     //  I thought you wanted to talk to her?
34A6B70A     //  Maybe you don't give a damn about that child, but I do.
03C791F2     //  I'm sorry, Detective, but I have patients to attend to.
03289156     //  Please, Detective, I really must get on with my rounds.
D11AA370     //  The girl needs rest, Detective. Ask your questions and go.
CFEC1226     //  Do whatever it is you have to. Then leave that poor girl in peace.
F77B2FC0     //  You can't hold me here! 
0CA0F4AB     //  No! I don't need to be manhandled by a doctor. 
7F6E40DF     //  I need my lawyer! Hey! Where is the telephone? 
9FBF5F11     //  Do you know who I am?
7DF01A9C     //  Hello, Jessica. 
27E3933B     //  My name is Cole Phelps. I'm a policeman. 
8EAFEF86     //  I'd like to talk to you about your accident if that's okay?
41AFCB30     //  Um... okay.
BEA29CF1     //  We need to get in touch with your parents, Jessica. To tell them what has happened.
0742F72D     //  Oh, you don't need to worry them. They sent me along to stay with Aunt June. 
D7008CE1     //  They trust her to take care of me.
465902C1     //  Legally you're still a minor, Jessica. 
2382B9B9     //  We have to inform your parents.
5C364729     //  Please. Please don't do that. My Daddy will kill me.
CE669660     //  Jessica, if you don't want me to call your father, you better tell me what happened.
9083019B     //  Please, please don't call Daddy. Why are you being so horrible to me? Can't you see what I've been through?
3C298AD9     //  You're lying, Jessica. How are we going to make this right if you lie to us?
273144E2     //  Please, Detective. Why would I lie to you?
D4D674D3     //  Can't you just let me rest?
4E03EDF7     //  Because you're a runaway, Jessica, and you don't have your parents' permission to be here. Now, do you want to tell me what really happened?
B0A16FA3     //  I went with Junie to this strange place... 
49083BC4     //  it's difficult to remember. 
D0E53652     //  Someone gave me a drink to calm my nerves and then I felt faint. 
5AF6FFE6     //  I think I must have passed out.
E763B0FA     //  Can you tell me what you remember about the crash?
D686F1F5     //  It's all kind of fuzzy. I remember waking up here. 
494DB033     //  Nothing happened yesterday.
FB9AEA3B     //  You could have died in the crash, Jessica. Why would someone want to kill you?
71C6EF3F     //  Someone wants to kill me? I wouldn't know anything about that. I just went along with Junie. She knows all about the movie business.
179F429C     //  You're holding out on me, Jessica.
58F0CAF2     //  Please, I want my doctor. I'm not sure I can answer any more questions right now.
0EF8E5A6     //  Tell the truth, Jessica. Why the big cover-up?
F29A377E     //  I'm not lying to you.
A5992294     //  I'm tired, Detective, and this has been all so awful. Please, please, just leave me alone.
026385E8     //  We found your underwear in your handbag, Jessica. You need to tell us what happened.
766153B6     //  The doctor told me what happened. I... 
75DF6D40     //  I didn't want that. 
9B2DB799     //  I just wanted to be a star - to be in movies. 
9A67CE02     //  I told Junie what happened, and she told me to toughen up. 
F855E60D     //  That that was the price of stardom.
BCD76A10     //  Did she now? That cold-hearted bitch...
C872CFBD     //  It's not Junie's fault. 
D42754CE     //  It's not my first time. 
664240B3     //  I had a boyfriend back home. 
5FB0913B     //  But, my father found out about him.
A8EAEFB1     //  Even if you consented, Jessica, you're still under age.
93292573     //  How did you meet Mr Bishop?
B944EB8D     //  Well, Junie is a big movie star. You probably know that. She's doing a new movie.
D2CB582A     //  What do you know about Bishop?
5AF25271     //  He makes movies. I had to do a screen test. 
C47F00B8     //  That's when you say some lines in front of the camera with the lights turned on you.
A471A37D     //  What's the story with Bishop and Mrs McAfee? Why does he want the two of you dead?
6AE051E4     //  That can't be true. Mr Bishop seemed very happy today. I mean... yesterday.
2F6AAE37     //  And that's why he wedged a shrunken head against 
32F01F49     //  the accelerator pedal 
72AC92D3     //  and punted the two of you over an escarpment?
4BADC0D0     //  I overheard Junie speaking to him on the phone a couple of times. Screaming, really... she can be very hard sometimes, Junie. But they seemed okay yesterday... like they worked it out.
1B1244AB     //  You're lying, Jessica. You're a victim of the oldest scam in Hollywood. Don't protect these people.
1F241920     //  I don't know what you are talking about. 
BF3743B7     //  Mr Bishop makes movies. That's all I know.
10E4D861     //  Please - I don't feel well. Do I have to keep answering questions?
4B619067     //  I know what happened to you, Jessica. Where exactly did it take place?
239A34F3     //  Please... it's scary. It's really difficult to think of anything...
98F51CF3     //  I had to wear a robe... and lay down on a stone... 
BE2B5E6D     //  there were lights, a camera. 
818566EC     //  It's not my fault. I'm not a bad girl. 
C349C722     //  Why are you trying to hurt me?
35F2D3DB     //  Goddammit - tell the truth, Jessica.
1B9CFDFA     //  I am telling the truth! I don't know where the place is. I barely know this city.
7C713FC2     //  I think you should leave now. You're being horrible to me.
FEDEA38C     //  Jessica, I really need you to help me here.
C5FAC5DE     //  I remember the mermaid.
87FF91B3     //  Was the mermaid in the movie too?
8576F29A     //  No, it was on the front of a building. 
B92468C5     //  We pulled up in front of the mermaid.
3787F594     //  Someone tried to kill you, Jessica. Do you get it? 
51BEB772     //  Forget about being in movies. 
387C9ABB     //  It's time to act like a grownup.
8F6EB903     //  Thank you, Jessica. You've been a big help. Here is my card. If you think of anything or you need some help, just get in touch, okay?
C99DEFFF     //  Okay.
F0BFA6CD     //  I think it might be a good idea if you went back home till you felt better, Jessica.
743A76F5     //  I couldn't do that, Officer. What if I got the part and I wasn't there?
F9C1EAAA     //  You should think about going home, Jessica. You're getting mixed up with people who will treat you like last week's trash.
756FCA02     //  Are you crazy? I can't go home. I want to be a star.
8050D4B2     //  It's the tale of this town, Cole. Lambs that go willingly to slaughter.
62943E2D     //  If you have more questions, could you ask them now? All I want to do is sleep.
0EFD8FA9     //  I've told you all I know. I need to sleep now.
7FA68618     //  The doctor said that I have to rest.
0BB5EDB6     //  You're making me uncomfortable, just standing around here looking at me, not saying anything.
1E1BE12F     //  No, that's enough. You leave me alone now or I will scream for the nurse.
7353B87B     //  You're feeling better since this morning, Jessica?
430E193E     //  A little. My head still feels swimmy.
F1601FAD     //  Who the hell is that?
C79B6E4D     //  Must be her lawyer. He certainly expedited her release.
D51EC818     //  I don't like it, Cole. Why's she in such a hurry? We should follow her.
7C23A53B     //  There she goes. Come on.
3F9AFA85     //  That was amateur hour, Cole. How are we supposed to find out what she was up to now?
C2F23683     //  We're here, I guess. Get closer and see what she's up to.
D14F48E2     //  No. I don't want him taught a lesson. You know what I want.
C7EF3930     //  Well then make someone else do it! 
E290AF40     //  You still know people out here, don't you? 
55816043     //  Then make some calls!
5BBAD212     //  ...then get someone else to do it. You still have friends out here, don't you? Make some calls!
62100344     //  I'm going to be very clear about this. 
C2871011     //  You get this done, or I'm...
D32F16DD     //  Wilson's Hotel.
4CDEAA9E     //  Mr Mark Bishop - that son of a bitch - lives in apartment 803.
DBD9A122     //  Honey, you're so good to me.
88A971EA     //  Sure I got the film.
CC9652A5     //  What did you make of the kid? You believe her story?
5FF16304     //  I think she was doped out of her tiny mind 
5CF06596     //  and given the casting couch. 
73BF75FD     //  That fucking bitch Ballard sold her out.
351DC8D9     //  So if Ballard was doing someone a favor, why did they try to kill her?

D306D710     //  Roger, KGPL. 11K en route.
5EEBEFA6     //  You the cops? I tried to stop them. It's room 803, left out of the elevator.
B6905BB0     //  It's the door at the end of the corridor. You've gotta hurry, Officer.
3F0408D4     //  Don't just stand there! There's no telling what those two gorillas could do.
51A46BA7     //  Look lady, I can pound you or I can pound your husband. Which one is it going to be?
0DCB832C     //  Please! I don't know where he is.
3DAFB1D8     //  Bullshit! Let her have it, Eddie.
F55BBE70     //  Help me out with this asshole, Phelps!
F8DE5933     //  Ain't saying a word to you till I'm all good and lawyered up.
AAC05956     //  My lawyer's card is in my pocket. Dial the number, copper. He'll be here in two minutes flat.
C72AE44D     //  Are you injured, Mrs Bishop?
EE239C29     //  I'm alright now. Those horrible, awful men.
74787183     //  Perhaps you should sit down, ma'am?
A96DC4AD     //  Yes. Yes... forgive me, officers. I'm very flushed. I'll just sit down for a moment.
6CACD4DC     //  That's perfectly normal, ma'am. Take a moment while we look around.
684123B4     //  Yes. Thank you. Oh, just look at this mess!
A0C852F3     //  Welcome to Wilson's Apartment Hotel. Can I help you, gentlemen?
CC79C925     //  I'm Detective Phelps. We received a call about a domestic disturbance in apartment 803?
30A41517     //  Oh, you're the detectives. Listen - Mrs Bishop's pretty upset. Take the elevator and then left down the corridor. It's the last door on the right.
DD6778B9     //  How rude. Walking out before I can tell you what's going on.
97A324EB     //  A crime has been committed. Don't just stand there.
D6D21018     //  All I know is all I've told you, Detective.
404CFCD6     //  Police? Oh, thank goodness.
1BA9B22D     //  LAPD, ma'am. Are you in danger?
E2402A35     //  I'm alright now. You just missed them. Horrible, awful men.
E248A34E     //  Are you injured, Mrs...?
6AFDDD7A     //  Mrs Bishop. Gloria Bishop. 
C8AAA046     //  Please come in, officers. 
2AB2FBF4     //  I'll just need to sit down for a moment... forgive me.
2A6FE1C0     //  That's perfectly normal, ma'am.
3F0E4F09     //  Just look at this mess!
CDDCD3EC     //  We'll take a quick search of the premises, ma'am. You take a moment to gather your thoughts.
BFEB7DF5     //  I-I will. Thank you, Officer.
43C86E0D     //  Looks like the old movie set, Downtown.
3D8DFA9E     //  Great Wall of Babylon. A replica of a replica.
15D636F8     //  Your husband was using June Ballard in his new movie?
36AB256C     //  Hardly. 
9C8ECBBA     //  Mark feels that June Ballard has limited range and is over the hill.
056AD889     //  The girl is named Jessica Hamilton. She was drugged. You should tell me what you know, Mrs Bishop.
54B04AA3     //  My husband is no saint, Detective. 
8FC90215     //  He is going to have to atone for his own sins.
2E26761E     //  June Ballard said she had a deal to be in his new picture.
04AA6066     //  Mark repeatedly told her, 'no'. He had Joan Leslie lined up for the role. That's how he got the finance. June made all kinds of threats - she was very rude to me.
5D8ADE05     //  You know June Ballard?
C36BA2E3     //  We were both on the same picture a few years back. That's how I met my husband.
DDF68E06     //  You're lying to cover for your husband. Do you know what you'll get for aiding and abetting?
D3FC1B10     //  I've been abused and slapped and now I'm accused of lying?
4FC7AD95     //  I would hope you would show a little more respect in the future.
A4E64DF0     //  Your husband was at a casting yesterday? 
7176EE5F     //  With a young girl?
87C86334     //  Not that I know of. 
EFA3158D     //  He told me he was looking at locations. 
8CE71937     //  The picture has been cast.
C99B707A     //  Ballard took a fifteen year old girl to a casting yesterday where she was drugged and abused. Then your husband tried to kill the two of them. You better tell me what is going on here.
9F7799CA     //  You're asking the wrong question.
9D14F345     //  What is the right question?
FB417F6D     //  What would push a degenerate powder puff like my husband so far over the edge that he'd be driven to kill?
99ADCA05     //  You know exactly what happened yesterday, don't you, Mrs Bishop? You've been through it yourself.
04828D62     //  I'm going to call my lawyer. You have a damn cheek, accusing me of that.
58F7915A     //  Jessica remembered a mermaid - the mermaid on the front of the prop store. You better come clean with me.
F34ABE00     //  This is a sick town, Detective. Are you sure you really want to know? The truth is my husband likes them young.
F5F3AD96     //  And you think that's okay?
5EFEF018     //  I was sixteen when I first met him. 
335170F9     //  I thought he was a genius - a magician with film. 
28C6EBE9     //  I was twenty before I realized he was just a B-movie hack. 
700AB215     //  But he's nothing compared to some of the monsters at these big studios. 
53657C7E     //  My guess is Ballard sacrificed her little friend. 
EA80B84C     //  Happens to a lot of girls.
4D809632     //  You should be ashamed of yourself, Detective. I've already been through a lot today without your harassment.
5FE3557A     //  Where can we find your husband, ma'am?
9B59E334     //  He told me he would be on set. That's all I know.
8B166250     //  Either we find him or McAfee's people do, Mrs Bishop. If you care for him you should make sure that we find him first.
5B05DE66     //  I do care for him, but I don't really know where he'd go if he were in trouble. Hopgood might know.
B717EEC9     //  You are complicit in all of this, Gloria. 
17AD6D7E     //  You know what happens to these poor deluded kids and you go along with it. 
9D98AC52     //  I need to find your husband.
CDFAD54B     //  Why'd you come to Hollywood, Detective? Handsome young man like you might find a little something in the movies. You've never thought about it?
E497B119     //  No, I haven't.
DA78C369     //  Well, then you must be the only person in this berg who hasn't. We're born into temptation, Detective. It's character that determines what we do about it.
0E5C86B2     //  You're lying, Gloria. He knows he has to get out of town and you're covering for him.
EA132392     //  I'm tired of this, and you have nothing to go on.
B4096399     //  Mark? Leave Los Angeles? Never. 
A8774F73     //  They'd have to kill him first. 
06A6C557     //  What other city would allow men to behave so abominably and celebrate the fact? 
1887A903     //  He'll talk or buy his way out of this.
B7470ED6     //  I wouldn't bet on it, sister.
B119DE82     //  Why is your husband paying Lorna Hopgood $20,000?
BA39CEAD     //  Lorna? Marlon's ex-wife? Are you sure?
7704F710     //  It's a lot of money, Mrs Bishop. Doesn't it strike you as unusual?
160592FE     //  Perhaps. 
6FDB822F     //  Movies are expensive to make. 
BA3C6414     //  You'd be surprised what expenses get hidden in the budget and how the money gets moved around.
E96C24E7     //  Your husband looks like he's being blackmailed. 
E85C8389     //  They obviously have something on him if he's prepared to kill to cover it up. 
1A6F9514     //  Why is the payment going to Hopgood and not McAfee?
995CBDCD     //  Lorna works at a check cashing place in Hollywood. You need to ask Hopgood why he needs that much money in cash.
9B09D33A     //  You're lying, Mrs Bishop. It's some kind of payoff. You know exactly what the money is for and who it's getting paid to.
954E19DE     //  Do I? Would you like to prove that, Detective?
C740F977     //  You're wrong, Detective. My husband is a miscreant but that doesn't mean he feels shame for what he does. He would never tell me.
700F385C     //  We need to leave now, Mrs Bishop. Do you have a friend who could come over and stay for a while?
AF3749C9     //  Thank you for asking. I'll be alright, Detective.
05698170     //  Presented to Mark...
3D279FF0     //  Who are these men in the picture?
D70A18B7     //  My husband, Mark, and Marlon Hopgood. They work together on occasion. That's Hopgood's shop.
7568C8CB     //  Looks like we've found our mermaid. Who are these men in the picture?
3CEADA24     //  My husband, Mark, and Marlon Hopgood. They work together on occasion.
7F99D6D8     //  Your husband is in trouble. It could go easier for him if you were more helpful, Mrs Bishop.
30309B12     //  He's a big boy, Detective, and so are you. This is Hollywood. There's always a deal to be done.
46837216     //  What do you have to do to earn twenty thousand dollars?
90A0B60F     //  Those men... I think they work for Guy McAfee. Do you know the name?
73C40487     //  No. Why should I?
19F5997E     //  June Ballard is married to Guy McAfee. Have you heard of her?
D1D2B088     //  That slut. 
A612B5A5     //  She's been badgering my husband for days.
7553E849     //  Mrs McAfee alleges that your husband tried to kill her and her friend last night. I think you should tell us what you know.
4C294030     //  My husband is a movie producer. 
B97C9985     //  This has something to do with his new picture. 
2F50813B     //  He doesn't include me in his business.
674DE36F     //  So you're going to leave a poor helpless woman here on her own and at the will of unscrupulous men?
596454C0     //  I'm grateful for your help, Officer, but it's time you went and brought this business with Mark to a close.
6B7DC211     //  A girl learns to take knocks in this town, Detective. You go, I'll be fine.
39D212F1     //  Can we get on with this please?
F2D47F17     //  You're as bad as those street thugs, and twice as dim. Get out this instant.
CEEA91DE     //  Let's get a patrol unit dispatched. They can scrape up these meatheads and get them Downtown.
C64E65CE     //  We need an address on this Silver Screen joint, with the mermaid statue. Call it in to R&I.
45A2BD63     //  I need a location on a Silver Screen prop store.
2631915B     //  Just a moment... 
BF4C413F     //  Silver Screen Props, corner Third and Figueroa.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
4B00F4B4     //  This has got to be the place.
30BB3A71     //  Phelps and Bekowsky, LAPD. We're investigating the attempted murder of June Ballard and Jessica Hamilton.
08632CD4     //  Christ! I'm Marlon Hopgood. How can I help?
554643F0     //  You hold castings here?
344CFF67     //  How'd you hear about that? I've got a little sound stage out back.
23E60E3B     //  Lead the way.
7EC40628     //  So... you coming?
605E9F7A     //  Keep him here, Stefan. I'm going to take a look around.
7D023B18     //  What's this got to do with me?
8F24750D     //  Don't try my patience, knucklehead.
43AB9A79     //  You ever do any work for Mark Bishop?
9F9F322D     //  I mainly do work for the studios. 
6D915CA1     //  RKO, Republic, Warner Brothers. 
38F670E7     //  So, yeah. 
5829285F     //  When Bishop is doing work for a studio, yes.
9F8827E5     //  When did you last see him?
0EA8A262     //  I'm doing work for his next picture. 
8050CA69     //  Still pre-production, though. 
BEF295D2     //  Haven't seen him round here in a while.
31FA100E     //  You and Bishop are... close friends? Colleagues?
273D16A9     //  It's business. 
459C5F92     //  I normally deal direct with the studio. 
4515FA66     //  Have you tried his production office?
20557005     //  He was here yesterday and something happened that pushed him over the edge. You're holding out on us, Hopgood.
E53CA8A4     //  You know, I have very good connections with the Vice Squad...
9863448D     //  Yeah, well, there's a surprise.
FC990C07     //  They won't appreciate you coming in here and strongarming me.
9EE5ACE6     //  I know you're lying, Hopgood. Bishop was here, and you know exactly what he was doing and what he left lying around afterwards.
8A3CF301     //  You come in here without a warrant, and now you start throwing your weight around?
0F9363A0     //  A fifteen year old girl told me how she was drugged and molested at a casting house. I found the Chloral Hydrate in your drinks cabinet. You give me something or I will break your fucking jaw, Hopgood.
B26579D6     //  Bishop was here with June Ballard and the girl. A lot of producers and directors use this place. I'm not responsible for what goes on here.
DBAA91A3     //  You should get your facts straight before you come in here and start shooting off that mouth of yours.
44C664C4     //  McAfee's men are looking for Bishop. We need to find him first. Any idea where he might have gone to ground?
4C609CF3     //  If he really tried to kill McAfee's wife, my advice to him would be to leave town.
E72F6610     //  Doping a fifteen year old kid and abusing her in a screen test. What is wrong with these people?
6F8A66B3     //  So this is where you sprang from.
39012D5D     //  Jungle Drums. Eighth and San Francisco. 
DF63527F     //  Attention: Mark Bishop.
DF8D0904     //  You're delivering props to Jungle Drums on Eighth Street?
2E80C317     //  Bishop is using that old run down wreck of a set. 
FBD70AFC     //  That place is dangerous, 
31D46B04     //  but it might be a good spot to hide.
3E51A246     //  I'm warning you, Hopgood. If you give him up to McAfee and we find out about it...
3E6E9CB6     //  Wind it back a notch, tough guy. I'm telling you I don't know where he is.
F8AC5A5E     //  You have something on him and now you're going to rat him out to McAfee's goons.
FF7D02E7     //  And how do you figure that, brain boy?
6889369B     //  I never liked Bishop. He always made out like he was better than everybody else. He was no better than any of the other big shot creeps who came in here.
B99B87D7     //  What's the deal with you and June Ballard?
320857BD     //  Look, buddy - I make props. 
F7BCE8F8     //  I hardly ever meet the talent unless it's something tailor made for them, like a sword or something.
D8BC1EF9     //  What made Bishop change his mind about putting Ballard back into the picture?
0E774D53     //  A bribe.
DB9D5179     //  What kind of bribe?
C514D0AB     //  Jessica Hamilton.
7A269F04     //  Ballard was out, then she's in. 
E927708A     //  Then Bishop visits this place and goes crazy. 
00E25F6C     //  You're in it somehow.
4C49F8E2     //  These clowns fuck young girls on the couch. 
8F97B2AA     //  The girls think they're gonna be stars - they really put their backs into it. 
83157998     //  It's a price they're willing to pay. 
8DC56567     //  None of them will press charges.
9CB475B0     //  You and Ballard are blackmailing Bishop. 
F4B3637F     //  That's why he cracked.
C1A3A694     //  You got nothing on me. My hands are clean on this.
E3441C2E     //  I'm about done with you and your accusations.
C878104C     //  Enough. I've been in your peep room, Hopgood. I've seen your smut pictures and the camera set up. You made a movie of Jessica. I found the canister.
4EA8BDA2     //  The deal is I get to sell the movies to burlesque houses and private collectors. 
8A0551D6     //  These movie guys love seeing their cocks on screen, but part of the arrangement is I never film their faces. 
ED62F274     //  June had me film Bishop, and then she kept the movie for insurance. 
4F95AD0F     //  He went apeshit when he realized his face was front and center.
DDE92EB3     //  Who has the film now?
425F647D     //  Who else? McAfee.
890C5EF0     //  Ballard had what she wanted. Where does the money come into it?
B0FF60C6     //  What money?
868124A8     //  So you're working for Guy McAfee now?
7F62AEEE     //  I hope not. 
4F6E11A6     //  I already have enough joy working for my current employer.
CEEF081F     //  You and Ballard are running a badger game on Bishop. How many other people have you run it on?
3F559097     //  I don't know what you're talking about. All these creeps want copies of their performances. They all have movie projectors and screening rooms at home so they can beat the meat in private.
5E5943A9     //  Enough of the lies.
849E6273     //  I told you - I get my cut selling dirty movies.
1E8F2C25     //  Your ex was getting twenty large from Bishop.
80712CA6     //  If I wanted to skim twenty from Bishop we'd do it through the movie budget.

54CAC531     //  Yes he is, Phelps, and a very important one. Look at that mug. Have you been upsetting these two officers, Marlon?
1340B266     //  So we just drop it?
6EA786FB     //  You do if you know what's good for you. You need to catch the movie producer before an angry husband does, from what I'm hearing.

4C7AD1CA     //  Get your hands off me. Don't ever tell me what to do and what not to do, Alfonse. You got a nice club here, don't spoil it.

80012348     //  Visit the morgue at the end of the month when the John and Jane Does are cremated. They're percentages - the odds for and against lightning striking.
A6B16C43     //  Second floor. Apartment six, in the back.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
2B5765C0     //  I haven't seen much, Detective. The suits waiting upstairs can give you the story.
8CA250FB     //  Classy lady, swanky place. It's a shame - real shame.
ACBC358D     //  Bekowsky. You made Homicide.
70265D8E     //  That I did. Good to see you, Phelps.
5C688274     //  You two want to hug, or can we get on with it?
E3EF87E4     //  Relax, Rusty.
0BE4FC47     //  Twenty-six years old. Fashion model. Found in the tub by the cleaning lady, a Mrs Reynoldson. She called it in.
9C561CC2     //  We heard Carruthers thinks...
8DB56B17     //  Carruthers likes to make work for people. Overdose of sleeping pills, falls asleep in the tub, Rest In Peace. Case closed.
87B631EC     //  Hear, hear.
B5E1B015     //  Mal is one hundred percent that it's murder.
F4D6C924     //  Do you mind if I take a look around?
44AC936F     //  Sure, go right ahead.
0F4946D0     //  Look around. I'm going to have a word with the maid.
DA042EC2     //  Back to work, Phelps. I don't like the way this broad bought it. I wanna get the guys responsible.
BC2691DC     //  I haven't got time to jaw, Cole. The Captain wants me to make this case.
EA9A5052     //  Oh fine, fine. You don't want to hear this, suit yourself.
862F8156     //  Come on, Phelps. Even Roy looks like he's working. Get on with it.
B8B74413     //  I'll say hello to the Skipper for you. For now, follow up on the Narco angle.
70210AC5     //  Hold it right there, college boy. I was talking.
5D72E401     //  This is her, in these photos? She's something else...
F281A5AF     //  Yes... I... Miss Julia was...
3D31DC7C     //  Pretty girl like that, maybe she was having trouble with some boys, huh? Maybe she got her heart broken? She couldn't take it anymore, so she ran herself a bath and downed some pills, and then she just drifted off...
410C210B     //  I don't know... Miss Julia, she always had so much fire... so much drive... I'm sorry. I'm not being very clear.
2378C2DD     //  There, there. It's okay.
0ECF9076     //  Beautiful girl. The clothes certainly aren't from the Sears catalogue.
9707102B     //  This is all top end of town stuff. Gives us somewhere to look.
9D59A0B6     //  Movie star looks and a wardrobe to match.
8EBA8A9D     //  Could have been a modeling assignment.
61892A99     //  It's a place to start.
DF8AAB58     //  Quality English smoking jacket. I don't know anyone under forty-five who would wear one.
1BC1B9C1     //  Barbiturates.
646A6FF1     //  Looks like barbiturates.
9A80F639     //  What else is rattling around in this thing?
DEB36A78     //  We should speak to her doctor. Prescribing both drugs would make her life a roller coaster.
A565DDF9     //  She dozed off in the bath. Why is everybody trying to build an angle around it?
B1E10D5C     //  You heard all that stuff the coroner said. It was pretty convincing.
CA57EDA9     //  Goddammit. Mal gets paid to be convincing. He talks that bullshit for a living.
117E37BD     //  But look at the broad. Look at the evidence. No assumptions - that's what you said.
70B043CC     //  I know what I said. Are you getting wise with me, Bekowsky?
A6765CEA     //  Mal, we've had a look around. Rusty thinks it's a waste of time. What's your theory?
981F629D     //  Come on, Mal. Tell us why we were dragged down here.
7C5782CC     //  If the victim was alive when she entered the tub, water would've entered her lungs. The water is violently churned in the windpipe as she drowns. The result is that a lot of foam is generated. This foam is found at the mouth and nostrils in almost all cases of real drowning. Notice anything about our vic?
E5871398     //  May I take a look?
5B5672D4     //  Be my guest.
53DA247A     //  Take a closer look at her head and neck.
E8AB7A29     //  A very unusual ring.
425857B9     //  I could be wrong, but it looks like a black sapphire.
7DFC23F0     //  Bruising on the forearms, and these... look like bite marks.
B4169C08     //  Very good.
203BE48D     //  Her neck is bruised pretty badly.
4C23DC5E     //  Right. Now take a look at the eyes.
02E980F2     //  The eyes are a classic sign of morphine, and the bruises tell their own story. I think one man held her down and another held her arm and injected her. They put her in the bath to try to cover it as a drowning.
5ED68A30     //  And spread a trail of barbiturates...
B675EA17     //  Take a look around outside on your way out and see if you can find the syrettes. It would make my theory...
1D7D7226     //  Morphine would have been very quick, and there wouldn't have been much of a struggle.
86737238     //  Okay, so find two guys who recently bought syrettes and weren't junkies and you might be on to something.
44686C41     //  Thanks, Mal. I'm going to speak to the cleaning lady - see what she knows.
94676012     //  You know I'm right, Phelps. This woman was murdered and the killers need to be found.
189BF763     //  This is Murder One. Get out there and find the guys who did it.
A7320CF9     //  Slow down, Phelps. I'm trying to explain here.
C9B74B29     //  I'm Detective Phelps. I'm here to try and help Julia. Do you mind answering some questions?
4102A893     //  Virginia Reynoldson. I'm just so shocked. I feel like there's something I should be doing. Someone I should call...
4578ED39     //  We can make those calls, ma'am. Who needs to be notified?
E2F042BD     //  That's just it, I don't know. Miss Julia doesn't have any family in town. Someone has to set her affairs in order... Mr Henderson maybe? Who else is there? I... I don't know.
19C489B3     //  If you give the details to the other detectives, ma'am, they can try and get in contact.
8FF8A63D     //  What was it like working for Miss Randall?
CDECAC92     //  Perfectly fine, officer.
B3BDF2AA     //  Do you do the housekeeping on a regular basis?
1CF69F2F     //  Twice a week since Miss Julia moved here from New York.
881B3A3B     //  Mrs Reynoldson, it seems like there's something you want to tell me.
22F943E2     //  She was very high strung. Lovely one moment, and screaming at you the next. She wanted it all and she wanted it damn quick. Of course, being so beautiful it seemed like she was going to get it... not the way it's turned out though, is it?
384E2654     //  You're hiding something, Mrs Reynoldson. There's something about Julia's past that you don't want to tell me.
A68E449A     //  And how do you come to that conclusion, young man? What makes you think I know anything about her past?
1AFC89A9     //  You're being very crass, young man. I have no idea what you are talking about.
A97302CC     //  Did Miss Randall have many friends visit?
A4294B4E     //  I'm not sure. I only come around twice a week.
0751DABD     //  But you cleaned up after parties.
23CE6FDA     //  Yes, I did. Sometimes beforehand. She was always so glamorous. She had the most beautiful clothes and jewelry. She could be hard, Miss Julia.
7C168908     //  Men friends, Mrs Reynoldson? Spill it.
18F1073A     //  I will not spread gossip about Miss Julia. She was very nice to me...
2AF4CD68     //  I don't care if she was the Virgin Mary, sister. Who was she humping? You change the sheets.
5F65F580     //  You're disgusting. If you are going to take that tone, I won't answer any more questions.
4E0C4394     //  Why are you lying to me, Mrs Reynoldson? Julia had men stay here.
6820341F     //  I will not speak ill of the dead. You can't prove that.
453B19DF     //  Who owns the smoking jacket?
2C47C76F     //  I wouldn't like to tell tales, you understand. But that's Mr Henderson's. An older man, very distinguished looking. He seemed very much in love with her.
19695F34     //  Where would we find him?
ECFE04A7     //  I'm sorry, I don't know. He said he lives in San Francisco.
365C8AE0     //  That's a terrible insult to Miss Julia's honor, and her memory. She's not even in the ground yet. You should be ashamed.
63FE5140     //  Was Miss Randall depressed about something? Upset?
6783C0A0     //  No more than normal.
873C5316     //  So she wasn't mad at anyone in particular?
F1C3C3E7     //  No. Men were usually besotted with Miss Julia, not the other way around. I don't think Miss Julia was ever in love with anyone.
DD1EBD31     //  Would she have killed herself for a man?
E9A97F9B     //  Miss Julia would never have killed herself. She was a very determined young lady. One of those people who shake the tree for all it's worth.
0273CC06     //  What are you hiding here, Mrs Reynoldson? Julia was obviously disturbed about something.
2453C075     //  I have no idea what you're talking about.
6D63542F     //  She was taking barbiturates. She couldn't sleep. You must have seen them in her room?
7E3997A8     //  You've seen the pillbox... the things she hid in there... 
47EDF279     //  I don't know how she supported herself. 
E795D0A9     //  Always new clothes and jewelry. 
F0BCC0E8     //  She lived like a movie star, a princess. 
405735CD     //  Does modeling really pay that well?
033F2EAF     //  If you were any kind of a detective, you wouldn't be trying to blame all this on Miss Julia.
34DB4D3E     //  I was going to scrub the bathroom, and there... there she...floating. I really can't talk about this anymore.
EC3EA61A     //  She was so beautiful... and so young. Can you leave me alone now?
2D08E109     //  I can't stand around here all day waiting for you... her face beneath the water... I need to do something.
381E319E     //  Where are you going? I'm trying, Officer. Please, come back.
7E6D244E     //  No more. Please, no more. You mustn't ask any more questions. I can't bear to talk about it.
CB433C71     //  Thanks, Mrs Reynoldson. You have been very helpful. One of the other detectives will take your statement and then you can go home.
0130BE58     //  I know you are trying to protect Julia, Mrs Reynoldson, but it won't help us solve the case. Julia can't be hurt anymore.
BAD0D4D0     //  Stefan, Rusty - we'll take a look around outside and then follow up these leads. 
B20E72B6     //  Can you get some guys to run down the jacket?
9C0600A6     //  You think Carruthers has called it right?
5111767B     //  He rarely gets it wrong.
CE99B263     //  I don't know. I'm with Galloway. I've met enough girls in my time who can't handle their dope.
FE4086A9     //  Mal will be pleased.
EA5E0C20     //  That's hardly conclusive, given the number of those things we have come across recently.
C7C33D8A     //  The autopsy will confirm it one way or another.
0EADBA3B     //  Can you get lost and let me work? This broad was built to be photographed, even if she is dead.
249B65A9     //  Look - I've got nothing to tell you, and I can't work with you under my goddamn nose every second.
C3C4A330     //  Most of the evidence is with the Coroner this time, Detective. I can't be much help.
7D94144E     //  I've got nothing for you. Talk to Mal. Between you and me, I think his theory is right on the money.
8541F3B1     //  You were right, Mal. Two used syrettes. Dropped near the dumpster outside.
AF60F5ED     //  Nice work. That's clinches it.
43EB321B     //  Here. Stoneman, office 505.
D659F253     //  I swear, if we locked up every doctor in this town, Vice'd able to work half days.
FFCA8136     //  Yes, sir. Your name?
2FDBA197     //  I'm sorry, sir, but you need an appointment. If I may have your name?
421FA73B     //  LAPD. We'd like to see Dr Stoneman.
D1C78B12     //  Dr Stoneman is with a patient. Would you like to wait?
8744FDC0     //  No, we wouldn't. Tell him we want to see him now.
744584BC     //  There's no need to be rude.
3F3525A9     //  Save it, sister.
D291C71D     //  Dr Stoneman, I have some gentlemen from the LAPD here to see you.
B88560BF     //  Send them in, please. I'll see this patient again after they have left.
3F147D40     //  If you don't mind, I have patients to see to.
DCE90405     //  Your partner is a creep and you probably are too. I have nothing more to say to you.
2F84D55C     //  Sir? Where are you going?
8BE8CF6D     //  Your investigation is much more important than my sciatica? I'm just in pain here. Leave me alone.
3C45FB48     //  Hurts to walk, hurts to sit down, and now I got policemen riding me like I'm a criminal. Get lost.
A38338F5     //  I beg your pardon! Who are you?
F1B04E82     //  Detectives. How can I be of service?
49887958     //  Dr Stoneman, we are investigating the death of one of your patients. Julia Randall.
8F13BF39     //  I'm very sorry to hear that.
AEB2028F     //  Do you mind if we ask you some questions about Miss Randall?
0EF420B7     //  Not if it doesn't compromise doctor-patient privilege, Detective?
D8093A23     //  How well did you know Miss Randall?
E420B9C0     //  Barely at all. She had only been a patient six months or so.
5EFA8365     //  She was disturbed, though?
1FB0BA80     //  Not in the conventional sense. She had trouble sleeping.
554C865C     //  You didn't like her, did you?
4F3BBAEA     //  It wasn't a question of like, Detective. She was incredibly beautiful. When you looked in her eyes you knew how a mouse felt before a snake... not an ounce of warmth there.
4BF8FE57     //  Dr Stoneman, 
978660B0     //  I get the impression that you knew more about Miss Randall's problems than you are letting on.
B4F5782F     //  You're accusing me of lying, Detective.
0B0778F3     //  If you wish to cross examine my motives then I will call for a lawyer.
811DBA07     //  You had been prescribing sleeping pills for quite some time?
21329BD1     //  I don't think. No more than a few months. It wasn't the... It wasn't the sleeping pills, was it?
5B106AEC     //  We believe she was murdered.
6F55D0CD     //  ...
2C246A3E     //  She was a troubled young woman. Did she confide in you?
B7EDDEAE     //  She wasn't the type, Detective, to confide in anyone.
3CD0BBA2     //  Dr Stoneman, you seem like you have something you would like to get off your chest regarding Miss Randall.
34BECBAD     //  Miss Randall had trouble sleeping, that's all. Are you sure you're alright, Detective? You're not prone to flights of fancy, voices in the head, that type of thing?
55E74EF5     //  Cole here suffers from an overdose of righteousness. 
B26462EC     //  Don't worry, Doc. He'll get over it.
4D99C8FD     //  Julia Randall has been your patient for nearly a year. I'm sure you know that.
63643842     //  Do you doubt my veracity, Detective? Do you have access to my patient records?
45F278F0     //  Your prescriptions contradict you, Doctor.
3762F8E0     //  Miss Randall was in the fashion business, as you probably know. 
20A7E7EE     //  She was jumped up on Benzedrine by day and knocked down by sleeping pills at night. 
54574A82     //  I told her to slow up - but no. Life was too short for her.
A5795D66     //  And you supplied the prescription for the Benzedrine.
37ED6066     //  It's not illegal, Detective. A lot of young women in her line of work use it for weight loss.
722E3543     //  I would hardly expect you to be so presumptuous in a case such as this. Very improper.
452B7DEC     //  You wrote Julia Randall a prescription for Benzedrine. How can you account for that?
49609898     //  Miss Randall was in the fashion business. She wanted to control her weight.
DEBADF87     //  She didn't appear to have a weight problem.
B60A732C     //  She had a self esteem problem. Miss Randall felt her only control over her life was through her appearance.
9C478B66     //  Benzedrine is addictive... as I'm sure you know, Doctor.
41DF0EB6     //  As I warned her. But she was determined. She said she needed it to control her appetite.
03C6EB18     //  Sounds like you knew her pretty well.
3B96707B     //  I knew the line of work she was involved in.
B02FA494     //  We believe Miss Randall died of an overdose of morphine. You didn't prescribe her anything else, did you?
86FAC0D3     //  That is a very serious allegation to level at a doctor, young man.
24BDF4E1     //  I am well aware what is proscribed under the Harrison Act, Detective. If you wish to make any other ridiculous accusations I suggest you direct them to my attorney.
F6D8F3C9     //  Do you know where Miss Randall worked?
1FDDFEA5     //  I have my patients' home addresses and next of kin. That's as far as it goes.
4678BF34     //  You said she was a fashion model?
1FD87E28     //  Yes, that's correct.
D260BB7B     //  We are investigating a murder, Doctor. You can either read whatever else is on that card, or I can reach over and take it from you.
76921421     //  There is such a thing as confidentiality, Officer.
1B16805B     //  Not for a dead woman lying on her bathroom floor there isn't. You want to obstruct me? I'll subpoena your patient records.
23B202A7     //  A clothing store. 6582 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood.
AD779D6A     //  See how easy that was?
9E731EBB     //  I think you're protecting Miss Randall. Was she a call girl, Doctor?
6A21A947     //  No, she was not. Not to my knowledge, anyway. How can you accuse me of covering that up?
3173D5F0     //  In case you jump to any further conclusions, Detective, I don't have any patients who are prostitutes.
D9DECBE4     //  If you will excuse me, I have patients to attend to.
AC037DC5     //  Can I ask you politely to go now? I have patients who need my help.
7C5E5888     //  Detective? Tell me - do you often lose focus like this?
F1975031     //  You cleared my schedule for that? Surely there's more, Detective.
033A03E9     //  I think we're finished here, Detective. We've made no progress at all and I have patients waiting.
9B01DA4C     //  That'll be all for now, Dr Stoneman. We'll be in touch.
404D8435     //  We often find the more obstructive people tend to be, Dr Stoneman, the more they have to hide.
F75026B3     //  The old boy is lying.
27DD4AC3     //  About what?
14DED5EA     //  I don't know. 
8D593C91     //  He looked relieved when you said she was dead. 
88022E5B     //  That's a strange reaction to have to the death of a young patient.
9F9AC040     //  I'm guessing Mal will have something for us by now.
882CADE7     //  Imagine me in that!
6DA5E1D0     //  I can't imagine it.
76C19493     //  On the red carpet outside the Biltmore Theatre, attending a gala premiere...
2E938C91     //  You, fit in that dress? Are you soft in the head?
10C64B10     //  I tell you, I'd do anything for a dress like that.
957A2F0C     //  We were just having a look. We ain't done nothing wrong. Leave us be.
134752A4     //  I know what you're looking for, mister.
3F1A254B     //  I don't know you, mister. We was just walking past, that's all.
AB61CE83     //  I wasn't leaving fingerprints on the glass or nothing. Leave me alone.
7BCA5C45     //  Well, hello. What can I help you with today?
2F8C0CCB     //  LAPD, ma'am.
0AFE5BD4     //  I hope I haven't done anything wrong.
59D436B2     //  No, ma'am. We're making some inquiries about Julia Randall. Does she work here?
9D6C04E8     //  No, I had to let her go. Is she in some sort of trouble?
F8CA5218     //  She was found dead this morning.
BAD239FB     //  How long had Julia worked as a model?
DC51DE3C     //  She worked in New York before coming here. She was a very beautiful girl.
8CBB8452     //  Could you tell us why you let Miss Randall go?
794E7D79     //  Husbands sometimes come in here with their wives. 
6430CE62     //  When Julia Randall modeled, the husbands were often more interested 
B6300F43     //  in her than they were their wives' dresses. 
6DE9159F     //  The wives weren't happy and neither was I.
4376741F     //  We need information on anyone she might have been seeing. Maybe someone she met here?
05D4E140     //  I'm sorry, I don't know of anyone. If she was seeing someone, he must have had money. Julia would never be interested in any man who didn't have real money.
0525E9BA     //  You weren't as shocked as someone normally is when told about a murder, ma'am. Is there something about Julia you want to tell me?
3353F6A3     //  You're accusing me of lying? How dare you! What basis do you have for this kind of accusation?
D1E6EAC8     //  Julia was incredibly ambitious. So am I. You have to be to run your own business. Julia's problem was she would cut any corner to get ahead. Life isn't like that. I guess she found out the hard way.
281E8637     //  Did she have any close friends here?
86E052E6     //  Actually, yes. Heather Swanson. Would you like to speak with her?
23AFBD0A     //  I'd like that very much. Please don't inform her about Miss Randall's death.
50DD2969     //  Very well, Officer.
F532BC94     //  Detective, this... this news is terrible but... I must get back to my customers.
6DC47ADC     //  I wish you luck, Detective. I hope you find whoever did this. I must get back to my customers.
E96DA8D5     //  If you don't get a move on, young man, people will start to think that you have lost your mind.
7498F638     //  Was that all you wanted, Officer?
C54D32A7     //  I am simply here to view the new spring collection, young man. I cannot answer any of your questions.
6C5D1B82     //  Please, young man. I hardly think I need your help to choose a new gown.
DF463DB7     //  Heather? These gentlemen are from the LAPD.
633B31C9     //  I'm Detective Phelps, this is Detective Earle. 
3CA9C6C1     //  I understand that you worked with Julia Randall, Miss Swanson?
897810E9     //  Yes. Julia helped me get my job here. 
F8033591     //  She's not in any kind of trouble, is she?
6C64970D     //  She's a hell-raiser, isn't she? Lives a fast life...
F2BF40EE     //  Oh, no. Maybe Mrs Stanley would call her that but I wouldn't. 
10D8E4FB     //  She's full of life... Full of wonderful company.
10C48CB8     //  That's a lovely engagement ring.
073E4C60     //  Do you like it? Henry gave it to me.
3AED6DFC     //  I'm very interested in engagement rings. 
74509482     //  Do you mind if I take a closer look?
BF729D7D     //  That's some pearl, Miss Swanson. Would have cost Henry a fortune. He must really love you.
7323E477     //  How did you meet Julia?
1215CAC4     //  I was introduced through my fiancé, Henry Arnett.
E2744EF1     //  Henry is your beau? Tell us about him.
130265A2     //  Yes, he is. 
2B7E3589     //  Henry has a fashion business. 
8CD31ACE     //  He and Julia have been friends for years.
FFCF9DC7     //  You know that Julia was using drugs?
7DFCFEF2     //  A lot of girls in this business do. They keep you alert and kill your appetite. I'm against it personally.
6CFD781D     //  Were Julia and Henry intimate before you started seeing him? Is there something you haven't told us, Miss Swanson?
B8B1C6DA     //  How would I know whether Henry and Julia were close?
3AAF9E5C     //  A woman has her suspicions, Detective. 
EAED69CB     //  Henry is really honest with me and whatever happened in the past, I know he really loves me.
25ADF41B     //  Are Miss Randall and Mr Henderson engaged?
0B1773C2     //  Who's he?
2A1AE1BF     //  She was wearing a sapphire engagement ring. Someone must have given it to her.
872BC0BB     //  She never mentioned a man named Henderson to me.
06DB1C0B     //  Look, lady, you need to give me something. Do you know anybody who would have cause to harm Julia?
CEB01518     //  No! Really, Mr Phelps... Julia's my friend. I don't know why anyone would want to hurt her. She's okay, isn't she?
E04B1632     //  Julia was kept by this Henderson character. The apartment, the clothes, the jewelry. Was she a call girl?
697AD8A5     //  How would I know? What evidence is there that says that Julia is a prostitute?
6E48ABC1     //  If Julia is hard, it's because of her background. 
EE7A4E61     //  To put it politely, she was quite poor. But a call girl? 
F59EAE6B     //  I think that that's ridiculous, quite frankly.
461B3E07     //  That's all for now, Miss Swanson. Could you ask your fiancé to visit Hollywood Police Station? It would be very helpful to our inquiry.
F89B91B7     //  Now, wait a moment. I don't think I'll pass on that message until you tell me why you're asking all these questions.
7AD5ED53     //  Julia Randall was found dead this morning.
250BC9C0     //  What? Oh... oh no! I can't believe it. She was so full of life.
867C3961     //  Really, now is not the time. Leave me alone.
7ED09F40     //  Please, not right now.
B0575F2A     //  You can't stand around here all day looking vacant. It's embarrassing.
A66FEC84     //  Don't go away, Detective. I want to know what this is about.
8B09A905     //  Any messages for me?
B2E5DCCE     //  Yes, Detective. The coroner has been asking to speak to you. I can connect the call, if you like?
2DE8190A     //  Please. Thank you.
0D70F7C9     //  Mal?
05C8DB60     //  Cole, can you get over here? I've just finished the autopsy.
6E746CF3     //  Sure thing, Mal. We'll be right over.
CB1D9052     //  Phelps? Coroner's waiting for you in the examination room next door. Go.
42B8A915     //  Detectives Phelps and Earle, here to see the coroner.
58A5160C     //  Yes, Detective. He's waiting for you in the examination room.
03BC6B0E     //  You'll want to speak to the coroner, Detective. I'm a bit busy right now.
1D62BF17     //  If you'll excuse me, I have some pretty tough phone calls to make.
9D614F78     //  Cole, Roy. I have some information for you.
F4A0EE39     //  You're the only person enjoying this, Mal. Get on with it.
EB3CF1A1     //  The bruising confirms two sets of hands. So we have two killers. Death was caused by heart failure due to an overdose of morphine.
28133777     //  Have you dragged us down here to gloat? We already heard your theory.
5624289C     //  We agree that she was murdered?
B2B9BF6F     //  Yes, of course.
A2584F86     //  I have something else to show you.
603B8441     //  Alright, Mal. What gives?
FC92302F     //  The dead guy's name's Jimmy Leblanc. Career burglar. He came in this morning - someone stove his head in with a lump of two-by-four.
D2DB8F13     //  So what? Good riddance.
23818AA8     //  I found two syrettes in his jacket pocket.
30D4108D     //  Wow.
7A67F43A     //  Hang on a minute, Roy. We're listening, Mal.
906DEF34     //  No sign of morphine use and no metabolized morphine in his blood. Scratch marks on his face.
7FCC90CF     //  Which could be from getting his head remodeled.
02954BCD     //  Time of death, Mal?
9641DF3A     //  Maybe an hour or two after the Randall girl.
6297CAD5     //  So you're saying laughing boy here could be one of our killers? That's a helluva longshot.
D37A0B28     //  Thanks, Mal. We'll check it out.
7611D59B     //  I found something else.
039DFF54     //  Sorry. I don't play.
EC8FF8B6     //  I don't know if it's significant. His wallet was empty. The only other things he was carrying were the harmonica and the morphine.
A77E56DB     //  Carruthers. Yeah, he's here. I'll send them over.
45E1C39D     //  They have a guy called Henry Arnett in Interview Two for you, next door. Let me know how you get on.
1FA5C145     //  Sure, Mal, and thanks for the lead.
A66C67EB     //  "Sure, Mal, thanks for the lead..."
555D5F2A     //  Contrary to what your partner thinks, I think the Leblanc angle has wheels. You need to follow it up.
C920DB68     //  You need to get back to the case, Detective. I've got reports to write.
A0009C23     //  You came all the way down here just to run out on me? Come on, Phelps.
24100891     //  Arnett is in Interview Two, Phelps. Go help him get whatever it is off his chest.
6EB81690     //  Mr Arnett - I'm Detective Phelps and this is Detective Earle. Thanks for coming in.
BBE51DE1     //  Call me Henry. It's the least I could do... terrible news about Julia...
ADF99488     //  How well did you know Julia Randall?
23202A59     //  Vaguely. I'm in the clothing business and Julia occasionally modeled for me.
AEABD728     //  And you were close?
D7D42EAC     //  We were friends.
3A7BF8EE     //  He's asking whether you banged her in a chuck-on-the-shoulder fraternity kind of way.
88525A4D     //  I'm engaged to be married. It wouldn't be polite...
6DAED973     //  Answer the question.
41E1612D     //  This will remain private? Heather won't have to know?
8B42B110     //  Yes, we had relations.
A6C21597     //  Come clean with us, Arnett. Was Miss Randall your mistress? Is that how she could afford such a lavish lifestyle?
B7D739B2     //  That's a ridiculous allegation. How could you possibly prove that I paid for Julia's things?
1837B476     //  We were strictly business. Julia and I came from different social backgrounds.
36DFF54B     //  Miss Randall's landlady said she was seeing an older man.
67E3193D     //  Could have been. I wasn't privy to all the details of Julia's private life.
C727E736     //  So you don't have a name? Someone we can follow up on?
5D545D97     //  Ah... no. I don't.
FF94DF90     //  Spill it, Henry. You know nothing about a man named Henderson?
8D1A7E21     //  Ah... yes, you're right. Henderson. Yeah... very distinguished.
912D2D9E     //  How about a first name, wise guy? An address maybe?
E8A59DB2     //  I'm sorry, I don't. I think he lives somewhere out of town. Somewhere back east.
CCFA38DC     //  Henry, I don't like when people lie to me. She was seeing a man named Henderson. You know who I'm talking about.
81C72F38     //  Easy on, Detective. I may have heard of Henderson, but I don't know his full name. I think he's from New York or someplace back east.
CAE8794F     //  That's funny. Julia told her cleaning lady that he lived in San Francisco.
722EEDA6     //  Okay - you got me. I don't know where he is from. Julia wanted money. She always wanted money. She thought she could get some from this guy.
889409DB     //  She was wearing a distinctive engagement ring. You think she might have convinced him to buy it for her?
2A76D510     //  Maybe he did, yeah. Maybe he and Julia were getting serious.
DE236FA8     //  I'm here of my own free will, Detective. 
E0C0DFC6     //  I'm doing my best to be helpful. 
5DB3EE10     //  The last thing I would want to do is lie.
9037766D     //  Ever heard of a Jimmy Leblanc?
F5AFB491     //  No. Should I have? Is he an entertainer or something?
9B25A153     //  He's a career criminal lying dead next door. Educated man like you wouldn't consort with criminals, would you?
6AB617BA     //  No, I would not.
8EDB2025     //  So you wouldn't have any reason to believe that Leblanc would be involved in Julia Randall's murder?
7AF91DFC     //  If this guy is a criminal, he might have been involved. But like I said - I've never heard of this Leblanc character.
CBC7600B     //  I think you're lying. I think Randall was a high priced hooker, and this Henderson character didn't want it to come out that he had been seeing her. I think he had Leblanc and an accomplice bump her off. I think you know who Henderson is, and you're trying to conceal his identity.
3D2B1792     //  I think you've been out in the sun too long without your hat. Prove that I know who Henderson is.
6874D514     //  I came down here to talk to you - to do the right thing, 
35A00B42     //  to try and help catch Julia's killers - and all I get is abuse. 
727C89F8     //  I'm not a criminal, Detective.
9CE7747C     //  Heather told us that you were in fashion?
6564F79E     //  That's right.
C1CF3017     //  You're some kind of traveling salesman?
3EE18077     //  Once I got out of the Corps I used my...
910786C7     //  You were in the Marines?
AC8F5219     //  Sure, and proud of it. The Fighting Sixth.
38FB552E     //  You were in the Sixth Marines?
169EA792     //  Yes. I was a Captain.
A7386370     //  Which company?
31A7D5EC     //  Ah... various companies. We had a lot of casualties.
87BD93E6     //  Which engagements?
14251ACF     //  Okinawa. A couple of other places.
0392155D     //  That will be all for now, Henry. You have been very helpful.
9517D9A8     //  Ready to talk some sense now, Arnett?
67C30609     //  Well, I have a business to run.
1E86561F     //  Terrible news about Julia. Shocking frankly. I'd rather not speak about it anymore, if you don't mind.
2A33FCA1     //  If that's all? Heather is distraught. I probably need to get home.
682CCDB9     //  Really? That's everything you need? I have more for you, Detective, I'm sure of it.
A313D6D7     //  No, no, no. I don't like where this is going. If it's all the same to you, I'm going to speak to a lawyer.
5B4FE5C9     //  That son of a bitch was never in the Marines... why did you let him off the hook?
9BDEB8BA     //  Because we're giving him a couple of minutes before we start tailing him. Arnett is an amateur. We need to find out who killed the girl.
C97BA8B4     //  Can you pass this on to Bekowsky? Have him check the place out and go through his records.
3B6B93AB     //  Sure. I'll pass it on.
0AF9386B     //  Thanks. Can you also have R&I run the records on a Jimmy Leblanc and find out who was his last arresting officer? Have him get in touch via KGPL when they have some information.
7B2CB17B     //  I'm on it.
2B9C6BF7     //  Quit hassling me, Detective. Isn't there work you should be doing?
BF48A360     //  Get to it, Phelps. Run your own errands. I'm busy.
5D333960     //  Don't walk away from me, Detective. Hey!
EE6F5FAC     //  He's in that car at the lights.
8EB743FF     //  Don't get too close. Hang back a little. Our bird looks plenty nervous.
DCC48D46     //  He's in a big hurry. Let's rattle his cage.
201E5A81     //  Let him do his own dirty work and we can see what he comes up with.
C14CA37C     //  Speed it up, Cole. Can't lose this son of a bitch now.
45EB813D     //  You'd better let him off the leash a little, if you don't want to get made.
48AB9877     //  This is stupid, Cole. If we don't keep it inconspicuous, he's never gonna lead us anywhere.
46D5A4DF     //  He needs money, and fast.
17A143D5     //  Get in there and find out what he pawned. I'll stick with him. See how he intends to spend the money.
32CFE651     //  Where do you think you're going? I take the pawnbroker, you stay on the suspect, remember?
A85DF095     //  Hoof it, Phelps. I'll bring the car around when I'm done here.
9A916FF3     //  That's right, Mexico City. One way ticket please. 
D79C5A5D     //  Next available seat.
F64EC10D     //  That would be one day from now. Is that okay?
BE30B80A     //  It's going to have to be.
CA41C9B7     //  If you're finished, sir, I have other customers to deal with.
8DEAE33A     //  I have tickets to reserve and issue, if you don't mind.
F42ACB9C     //  Uh... very well, sir. If that was all you needed.
34093844     //  LAPD. 
503398FE     //  The man who just came in here - he bought a ticket?
859EA68F     //  Yes, sir. To Mexico City, tomorrow night.
4BBB40AE     //  If you hear from him again, don't mention this conversation.
0DEEB0EC     //  Okay, Detective.
E57EEC82     //  What have you got?
692E67F0     //  He bought a ticket for Mexico City. Tomorrow night.
C4F0E676     //  That's good... but this is better.
5D0139C0     //  Should have seen the look on the pawnbroker's face when I told him to hand it over.
1DD3CD46     //  My God. It's Fabergé.
F187E42B     //  The guy who owned the joint thought it was worth at least ten large. For a cigarette case! 
D11A9166     //  Arnett only got six hundred clams.
47B0A3E8     //  Car 11K. Car 11 King, come in.
18DB838C     //  Car 11 King, go ahead.
630A2E1B     //  R&I reports the last arresting officer for DOA Jimmy Leblanc was Patrolman Fred Wallis. He's working a shift on Hollywood ninth beat, Sunset Boulevard between Gordon and Wilcox.
B0C14EEC     //  Car 11K en route.
FF917D0A     //  Any luck with the arrest record check on Jimmy Leblanc?
9B958254     //  Yes, Detective. Jimmy Leblanc's last arresting officer was Patrolman Fred Wallis. He's posted to Hollywood ninth beat, Sunset Boulevard between Gordon and Wilcox.
F6197829     //  Run the bum over and help out a brother officer.
27DBCD9B     //  Wallis, go left! I'm going right, after this little prick in the alley.
D81E80DB     //  Thanks. 
18C48810     //  Outstanding warrant. Armed robbery. 
70F99C8A     //  Knocked over a drug store back there, and it looks like he brought his whole posse with him. 
5BF1D1BC     //  Bad luck for them.
A42554E9     //  They're all yours now. We need some information.
EF494BE8     //  Ever heard of a burglar, goes by the name of Jimmy Leblanc?
4AC2D89C     //  Sure. 
7B4EB0B2     //  I nabbed Jimmy on a burglary beef a couple of years back. 
98A5D0F7     //  They cut through a music shop and into a jewelry store. 
FE0BA516     //  He got four years. 
2EBE902D     //  I missed his partner though.
E4FE39B1     //  His partner?
933D9BD7     //  Big guy. 
85F6AC0B     //  I had him cornered, and he picked up this huge display case and threw it out a plate glass window. 
53E54065     //  Then he vaulted outta there like something out of Barnum and Bailey.
D8F293A4     //  He got away.
B3D60AA5     //  I would have had him 'cept for Leblanc yelling, "Run for it, Willy!".
5A2619D9     //  And you think he was an acrobat of some sort?
8E4F5D77     //  More like a strongman. A wrestler or a boxer, that kind of thing.
C7E8D145     //  Thanks. You've been a big help.
FCEB3BB4     //  You haven't done too badly yourself.
5E863566     //  Thanks for mowing down that shitbird. Don't know how much longer my legs would've held up.
EF58D923     //  You goin' after that big monkey used to run with Jimmy? Hope you have success with your case.
3354BE1D     //  You're suggesting Leblanc is still working with Willy?
A0FC5D65     //  A strong man held down Randall while someone administered the morphine. 
4FA114E2     //  Someone with muscle opened up Leblanc's skull.

3D87FD06     //  We caught up with Mal. He's given us the dope on Leblanc.
E6BF3A52     //  He worked burglaries with a big guy, goes by the name of Willy. He might be our killer. Can you work boxing gyms, the Y, promoters - that kind of stuff?
E2A08F14     //  Since when have you started giving orders, Phelps? And where's the burglary angle? There was no sign of a...
E38BBF76     //  That's where Arnett comes in. Next stop we speak to Lacey about a list of recent burglaries.
7757F245     //  The guy's a bum. His office is a front and he's behind on the rent and his phone bill.

30538EC6     //  No thank you, ma'am. We have some questions, if you don't mind?
F9C04554     //  Why would I mind, young man, if you are returning forty-three pieces of my property?
56D02954     //  Okay - before we get down to that, I'll have a scotch, thanks. Straight up.
38B1EFDA     //  Maria, can you get the detective a drink, please?
3E5954AE     //  What can you tell us about the burglary?
ED9C7BCC     //  That terrible night. At least a year ago. 
4D41E169     //  But let's not go into that. Let's talk about what you've recovered.
3721CFEC     //  Were you in the house when the burglary took place?
75314C21     //  Good heavens, no! I was at a social function held by a Dr Harold Stoneman and his lovely wife. I returned home and all of my things were missing.
BC7C7429     //  I get the sense that you're worried about something, Mrs Evestrom.
AEFD4240     //  I have already received the insurance claim, Detective. Is there any way we could keep the return of these items discreet?
D7637B1E     //  I think you know more about this burglary than you are letting on, Mrs Evestrom. There isn't an insurance claim involved, is there?
F3AA9378     //  Are you accusing me of having my own home burgled? How dare you! What possible proof do you have for this scandalous remark?
377B26F1     //  I would appreciate it if your friend finished his drink and the two of you left.
B51D1103     //  Can you describe to us what was stolen?
5452FACC     //  It would be easier to describe what wasn't stolen, Detective. A priceless tiara that has been in the family for fifty years, a Fabergé cigarette case that was worth twenty five thousand dollars...
0031B0E9     //  We recovered a black sapphire ring.
61381973     //  A beautiful piece. It belongs to my daughter.
93C14A08     //  So you have no idea who did this burglary? A lot of these cases tend to be inside jobs.
01AFDB26     //  How dare you impugn my character and the character of my staff! If you have no further questions, I suggest you leave.
2AA38161     //  Why are you lying about the value of your jewelry, Mrs Evestrom?
DA5AF286     //  Who do you think you are, making heinous accusations in my own home?
257888E2     //  We recovered the cigarette case from a pawnbroker. No one knows the real value of an item better than those guys.
BE05BE28     //  I inflated its value for the insurance claim. There. Are you satisfied? My daughter's boyfriend was quite taken with the case. I think he was even more disappointed than I was when it was stolen.
C193CD19     //  Young man, you are being quite diabolically rude. If that's all, I would like you out of this house.
AA2616EF     //  That's about it for now, Mrs Evestrom. 
90E41A02     //  The department will get in touch, let you know how you can recover your valuables.
2E8E1F0A     //  You have only mentioned a few of the items that have been stolen, Detective. 
7AB9CFFD     //  What else has been recovered?
C0455588     //  You see, Phelps? That's why you get the drinks in early.
D53FB296     //  Hello, Mother...
11EA577E     //  Hello, Detectives. What is going on?
0FE98173     //  We'd like to ask exactly the same question.
835A64FA     //  You have met my daughter?
60FC0B0F     //  This morning at work. 
9AC44273     //  Oh...
242E6E52     //  Mother and Father divorced. I took my father's name.
78158A08     //  The detectives recovered some of the things that were stolen, darling.
C91B7FFD     //  What did you find?
29DC8DD8     //  A sapphire ring, on the corpse of Julia Randall.
C8E25565     //  What are you talking about?
44363223     //  Your engagement ring, Miss Swanson - 
8F51498B     //  would you be surprised to know that it was part of the proceeds of a burglary?
5C13A015     //  That's an outrageous allegation!
EDC38E98     //  Yes it is. 
59172CDC     //  I suggest we go straight to Henry Arnett's place and sort this mess out.
A55B77E7     //  All this talk has me considerably vexed, Detective. I'm... I'm sorry... you'll have to give me a moment.
5C58DF97     //  Go and find my jewelry pieces and bring them back to me, Detective. It's very important. Each one is a memento from my dead husbands.
4E30192C     //  Maria! I think we'd best get this officer a drink to get him moving. He looks rather gormless.
EE1866FE     //  Excuse me? Come back here, Detective. You were telling me about my valuables.
840CD49C     //  We're missing something here. Arnett is obviously arranging the burglaries...
04C14988     //  That's my fiancé you're making scurrilous accusations about!
A7AD30DB     //  And Randall was obviously his partner...
55DEED32     //  But neither of them are the type to creep apartments.
4076422D     //  So you make Leblanc and Reade for the B and E's. Leblanc is dead. That makes Reade our boy.
F5CDEAEF     //  You're being ridiculous! Both of you! There's a very good explanation for all of this...
44EC6ED5     //  Put a sock in it, sister. You're being played for a patsy and you're not even smart enough to see it.
FBDA6BC4     //  Back here, Cole. I'm not babysitting this broad on my own.
FC942EBF     //  You think this is funny? Come on, Cole. If we don't move now we'll lose our shot at Arnett.
46341267     //  Come on, sister. Let's find out who your fiancé really is.
5EB2ABE4     //  Welcome, sir. I'm sorry... are you a resident?
3E692C25     //  LAPD detectives. We're here to speak to Henry Arnett.
52C8BB87     //  Oh. Uh... Mr Arnett. Apartment thirty. 
0A65A77C     //  You can take the lift.
AF8719D0     //  Thank you.
EB5615AE     //  Please, Detective. If this is police business, I'd rather not involve myself.
804CE1B8     //  I'm sure there's nothing I can tell you. I'm sorry.
C98BB576     //  Detective? You're leaving?
5649590B     //  Well, isn't this just nice and awkward.
708CE2E2     //  Don't kill him, Cole! This guy is our case.
115FDD18     //  Go on! Get after him!
8BCDFCA1     //  Looks like he got you good, Phelps.
332F547C     //  Yeah, he really packs a wallop. 
8A507FE0     //  How did I get back here?
4103CB73     //  Under your own steam, miraculously. You came in through the window, said hello, and then keeled over.
6B8C0464     //  How is Arnett?
1947416F     //  He's coming round too. He's all hopped up. 
A7AD8E6A     //  Good time to get some answers.
FB406515     //  You missing something, Henry?
B9D0F882     //  Take a look through his things. See what else this snake is hiding.
20EF7C6A     //  Vacheron Constantine. That's an extremely expensive watch, Henry.
3A3753AA     //  A graduation present from my parents.
9DE6C9B4     //  You told Heather you're honeymooning without her?
8A052E3A     //  We know all about the jewelry ring. You and Randall, and Leblanc and Willy doing the legwork.
D898B3D8     //  I'm in the fashion business.
EAF4EBFC     //  Your office is empty and you're behind on the rent.
9D67703A     //  Times are tough.
6CE1A84F     //  Miss Swanson might be gullible enough to believe your story, Arnett, but I'm not buying. You're involved in a burglary scam and so was Julia Randall.
71CE9470     //  I'm a legitimate businessman. I can't speak for Julia.
8048EC9B     //  You're lying, Henry.
6A9862C4     //  How can you prove that I'm involved, Detective?
09F5312B     //  Because you pawned a Fabergé cigarette case today for six hundred dollars. A case that is on a list of stolen items.
50A52DFF     //  It was Julia's idea. Get a list of society parties and find out where and when and then have the guests burgled. Julia was desperate for money... no matter how much we made, she always wanted more.
31C307C0     //  I thought as much. Shouldn't you be calling me an ambulance or something?
B33DECBD     //  Why did Reade and Leblanc kill Julia Randall?
8D08E90F     //  I wanted to stop, to get out of that life. I was going to marry Heather if she'd have me. Julia told the others that they were out, that she was going to create a new gang.
725AB58F     //  But why kill her?
0925EE98     //  She always looked down on those two. When she told them that she was cutting them out, they swore to get even with her.
5529B0BB     //  You wanted Julia Randall out of your life?
85872249     //  Why would he want that? Julia was our friend.
58380F42     //  Julia was his hump, sweetheart. They were the Bonnie and Clyde of society burglars. He met you and realized he didn't have to steal anymore. He could just mooch from you. He needed Julia out of the way...
4D10256E     //  Julia was insatiable. She didn't care about anyone. Not the least me. She was never going to go back to the poverty she came from. I wanted her to stop.
A43D3A2C     //  You're lying, Arnett. 
EC094999     //  I think you ordered them to kill her. 
0A9D8287     //  It was made to look like suicide, 
C952A7D9     //  and when the coroner saw through that you knew it was time to run.
56A3F351     //  I told you I was involved in the burglaries. 
8088C9A0     //  I had nothing to do with Julia's death. 
4D5AF4BB     //  Why would I need to run?
78F64C37     //  Have you told Miss Swanson that you are leaving for Mexico City tomorrow night? That it's a one way ticket?
A18554E9     //  Henry? Tell me it isn't true.
666AED5A     //  I had no choice. I wanted to marry Heather. 
134B176E     //  I told Julia I wanted out and she laughed in my face. 
E0722F22     //  I had to pay Willy and Jimmy a fortune to do her and now I'm completely broke.
0E14BE2B     //  What you are, buster, is under arrest.
FF76C860     //  That's some story, Detective. But you can't prove any of it.
A78B3BB3     //  Who is Henderson and what is his involvement?
90260B6B     //  Tell them what you know, Henry. I'll stand by you if you'll only tell the truth.
FAA449AE     //  There is no Henderson.
FACCB1EF     //  So you've taken to wearing smoking jackets, have you?
AD5F6A4A     //  No. What are you talking about?
99B6D601     //  Give it up, Arnett. You're facing the gas chamber. Give the judge some reason to commute.
A6061ED4     //  You still don't get it, do you? Julia entrapped everyone. She was so beautiful and so goddamn cold.
5A5C2456     //  Tell me about your first burglary and don't lie.
D2D69EBC     //  I can't remember. I don't keep a list of these things.
E8F1DD84     //  Your first burglary was a Dr Harold Stoneman. Do you want to explain how he is involved or shall I?
B07D3784     //  Henderson is Stoneman. He was crazy about Julia. 
3E4F5D1C     //  She could get him to do whatever she wished. 
F10CBEDA     //  He threw the parties and we arranged the burglaries. 
720CC3EE     //  Julia never let him touch her. She just kept him hanging on the promise. 
6687C3DF     //  Drove the good doctor almost insane.
C0CF44DD     //  No such person, Detective. I'm sorry to disappoint you.
1B4D4514     //  I have nothing more to say.
427661B1     //  I had to be as ruthless as Julia. It was me or her. That's all I'll say.
14782124     //  If I'm not under arrest and you're just going to stand around, do you mind if I leave?
973FC6D5     //  You won't let me leave until we've finished this, Detective, so you'd best get on with it.
D0D7C9ED     //  If we're going to talk again, it'll be in an interview room, with my lawyer standing by. You want answers, go talk to Stoneman. Ask him about Henderson. Watch him twist in the wind.
6B485BA6     //  Henry Arnett - you are under arrest for burglary and for the murder of Julia Randall.
4EC27C98     //  Henderson is Stoneman. Alright? I'm not the guy you want. Go talk to the good doctor.
213D4CFF     //  Oh, we will, knucklehead. Meanwhile, we're fitting you for convict stripes.
93AF9576     //  Call a lawyer, Arnett. You're going to need a good one.
0CD2F9F5     //  Henderson is Stoneman. That's what you wanted. I gave you Stoneman.
C1453B51     //  Let's go see Dr Stoneman... or Henderson... or whatever he's calling himself today.
550E60D3     //  Time for the doctor to give us something to make this all better.
5B069751     //  Hang on a moment, sister.
93838D48     //  Tell him it's Henry Arnett.
303911D2     //  And tell him it's urgent.
5EECBB9D     //  I can't do that.
425EBAE1     //  Tell him, or I'll charge you with obstruction of justice.
EBDB3F84     //  Doctor, I'm afraid Mr Arnett is here to see you and he says it's urgent.
99A3830A     //  Send him in.
54157C52     //  I told you never to come...
83B964DE     //  Tell us the truth, Doctor.
6E18314C     //  I'm so glad you came. 
FD417738     //  Prison will be better than insanity... 
468906C0     //  and I'm already half insane with grief. 
E35F11AA     //  Do you know that I loved her? 
E3E076D9     //  I ruined my life for her and yet I still love her.
D85592C2     //  Will you testify in court that Arnett and Randall did these robberies?
4D1466C9     //  They organized the robberies. 
A8978BC1     //  Julia would get the names of the guests attending my wife's parties. 
63B20168     //  Didn't matter how much money I showered upon her, it was never enough.
BCE110FA     //  She... 
1FA53A47     //  never really cared for me.
5A06A069     //  Doctor, I'm afraid you're under arrest.
6F55D0CD     //  ...
118AD610     //  The practice... you'll call Doctor Gerard... 
5D5AAADB     //  no, no, no, 
D632EF2C     //  please don't cry...
96FB8BB3     //  I want to see no one. 
58086F91     //  Not my wife or my children, nor my friends. 
BBF350BD     //  And I don't want a lawyer. 
FD97317A     //  Just lock me up and throw away the key. 
41B91226     //  What have I done?
AE598575     //  Good God.
9D858936     //  Didn't see that coming.
E1EEB2E7     //  I need an ambulance and the coroner immediately to the offices of Dr Harold Stoneman. 
BA60785F     //  1646 Ivar Street, Hollywood.
5C840738     //  En route, Detective. You have a message. 
422CAE2C     //  Detective Bekowsky says the suspect is named Wilson 'Willy The Wolf' Reade, former wrestler. 
E4D28B91     //  Last known address is an apartment building at the corner of Hollywood and Vine. 
25B4C312     //  Detective Bekowsky says to meet them there.
200B1EBA     //  On our way.
1E64EAB3     //  We have an address for the runner.
92445106     //  Let's try and wrap this up then.
234DA96A     //  Thank God I didn't park there.
08D9EDAC     //  That old boy really fell for that broad.
946D5EF8     //  She was incredibly beautiful, Roy.
3B164513     //  Would you throw it all away for a woman?
09D4E454     //  Life has a way of making you pay for your pride.
E05EA0C9     //  You're quite the romantic, Phelps. Stick with the percentages. Broken hearts are for chumps.
D16790D2     //  You're talking from experience?
E72960B8     //  I certainly am. Oh, I like women as much as the next guy so long as they're in their place and doing what they're told.
1E9F2298     //  He's around here somewhere. A big guy. Neighbors say he always wears basketball shoes and a cream jacket. And get this - the kids around here say he plays the harmonica.
55E5037E     //  Find a gamewell and have the commander set up a dragnet. We want the area closed off. We'll take this side of the street.
E15B598D     //  A harmonica-playing wrestler. That's a weird one. Think he knits as well?
A01FC541     //  Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut. We don't want him to bolt on us.
3665BE6B     //  Wait, Cole. You hear that?
768DB02D     //  Wilson Reade! LAPD! Give yourself up!
1866057D     //  Hold it... he's gotta be around here somewhere. No place to go, unless he grew wings.
A9AFBA7B     //  There he is! Waste the son of a bitch!
5D3248C1     //  Let's get out to the scene before they bag her.
7DCA9B98     //  What are we missing? Let's go back to the apartment.
69C79417     //  We'll need the scoop from the Homicide boys and from Mal before we do anything else.
72E90496     //  Once you've checked the bathroom, Cole, you better take a look around.
1BA476D7     //  You want to talk to the cleaning lady? Be my guest.
B39BF8D8     //  You want to go digging around in drains trying to support Mal's theory, you go ahead. I'm not getting my hands dirty.
FC2C1B45     //  Her doctor was prescribing enough pills to stop a horse. Maybe we should pay him a visit.
9BB8367E     //  We're not letting the doctor off the hook, are we? Come on, Cole. Let's go back.
BA799802     //  You got any idea what office the guy is in?
59988B9B     //  Badger the lady on the front desk, Cole. We don't need an appointment.
CC5ED263     //  Okay, time to grill the good doctor and get his story.
017405B8     //  I say we check out the dress shop.
D9588072     //  The only lead we have is the dress store, Cole. Let's go back.
557EF7E2     //  We need to have words with the owner. Find out what kind of employee Julia Randall was.
1505CB4A     //  Get a statement out of the Swanson lady, Cole. 
9780DCCC     //  Classy girls seem to warm to you.
C897CF9D     //  Crime scene reports might be back by now. You should check for messages.
8DAB54A5     //  Sounds like Mal has our next contestant on the slab, Cole. We better get over there.
815626FF     //  The only choice we have is to go back and listen to Carruthers crow about his big theory.
E15D00A7     //  May as well get this over with. Let's go and hear Mal's fairytale.
F39AF266     //  Hey. Mal's got something he wants to show you.
4BDDC507     //  Hey, have you ever played one of these things?
760FEFCF     //  We should see what we can shake out of Arnett, while we've got him in the interview room.
4E4F34EB     //  Better check the man's business card, Cole. In case we need him later.
7977C4BF     //  Arnett is a knucklehead. We tail him and see where he leads us.
06ACED7F     //  We need to talk to the uniform and get the dope on Leblanc.
E21D9F6C     //  Get after the guy, Phelps! Come on!
946EE1FC     //  Might be time to call in, Cole.
3EC35120     //  Every career burglar has his name or his work on a day book somewhere, Cole. Let's get back to the station.

0A258D2F     //  Didn't you say you wanted a list of recent burglaries? Ask the Watch Commander for a copy .
9C07E40E     //  Are you going to check that burglary list or what?
85BFA3A6     //  Okay. We check out this Evestrom broad and see if we can make the link between the burglars and Arnett.

531815BA     //  Talk to the Evestrom broad and see what's what.

88683048     //  I work here days and play my horn nights. Why don't you fellas cut me some slack?
07AFB6DD     //  Tell us what you know about Jermaine Jones.
4620865E     //  What's to know? All he's supposed to be is some booking agent. That's his jive anyway.
7563F841     //  Does Jermaine Jones get you lots of work?
5EE81362     //  Hell no, he don't care. If it weren't for this burger stand, I'd probably be living under my coat in an alley somewhere.
6DDE3907     //  So you just keep this food hut setup going for kicks? Do you think we are stupid, Fleetwood?
97AA2ECF     //  I'd be very fucking careful how you answer that.
12B924E6     //  Jermaine is moving that shit for some gangster jewboy motherfuck. 
7802DE74     //  That's all I know. Look, I do what I'm told and I'm happy to have work.
3B3D3F00     //  Where can we find Jermaine?
5A65459E     //  5528 Santa Monica Boulevard.
F1A8E653     //  Jones is involved with the morphine. You know it and I know it.
A6A99A99     //  Jermaine is a lousy fucking agent, that's all. You got nothing on him.
87842C11     //  You should try surviving on what a colored man makes playing music in this town. 
63F1B6FD     //  Now, you can take me in, but I'm not telling you no more.
11329911     //  We have you for the hop and resisting arrest. Tell us about the numbers if you want our help.
CAF6A31C     //  Look, the numbers are the white man's tax on poor folk. 
F413DD5F     //  Alright? Now what else do you want to know?
03CD3BC2     //  Do you run the numbers from here, or from the Blue Room?
0222729C     //  You ever been to the Blue Room? That's for rich white folks who wanna listen to the black man's music, if they're scared to be seen in Negrotown.
53C671A1     //  We have an address on the slips. We're going to go down there now and rat you out, Fleetwood. Tell whoever it is that you rolled over and gave them up.
4DCF3832     //  No, no, no, look, I've been cooperative, okay? Now you gotta help me some!
096B34D1     //  Fleetwood, I'm going to speak personally to the judge on your behalf.
38215DA9     //  A name, Fleetwood.
C068AB63     //  He's a real slick dude. Wears a hat and swings a cane, goes by the name of Merlon, alright? I ain't got a last name.
673C29E1     //  Cut the jive, Fleetwood. You're running your own numbers racket from this food stand.
D453FC74     //  You got the tickets but you got nothing else. 
2DCAB095     //  Now how you gonna prove that I run a lottery?
1D4FFA76     //  Look, I'll let you in on something... 
48BAB994     //  the numbers is ran by white people, Italians and those Jewish motherfuckers. 
380BA39E     //  Not black musicians in fifty cent shoes.
C54610EF     //  See you at the station, Fleetwood.
25200789     //  Wait, you're going to help me, right?
61F24D90     //  Of course, kid. You helped us out, and we always like to repay a favor.
95FBFCB2     //  You ordering, mister? I can't much help you if you ain't.
703A4FF6     //  Look, been a slow day, sirs. So, if you ain't hungry, you better leave me be.
8D0FDBB8     //  Look, I gave you all I got.
B8A342EB     //  Look, I gotta get back to the counter. Them steaks'll gonna be burning.
FEBE9C59     //  You making me nervous, staring like that.
31AC7105     //  Look, I ain't dancing round with you in circles no more, Mr Policeman. So if you're gonna run me, go ahead and get with it.
E8FAF599     //  Can you see that Fleetwood gets a nice cell, Wallis? 
E76B7A48     //  One with a window and a nice fresh pillow.
3F4D3C18     //  We've got this, Detective. I guess you've got leads to follow up on.
7E774B34     //  We'll get him Downtown. I hope the case opens up for you but we're done here.
1CD00542     //  I'll have to get back to my beat once we book this guy.
E71C0C39     //  I'll make sure all of your evidence gets bagged but I don't have any leads for you.
D33291D6     //  Detective Roy Earle, Vice squad. Badge five-eighty-six.
F864BA67     //  Go ahead, Detective.
99ABB9E2     //  Can you run something by the other guys? I need the skinny on a negro, goes by the name of Merlon, runs a betting shop and a numbers lottery.
783A5356     //  Is that all we've got to go on?
7B3C5EF7     //  Afraid so.
77A69E21     //  You'll have to give us some time. These places don't usually advertise. We'll get back to you once we have the information.
09416431     //  I need an address on a Jermaine Jones' Musical Booking Agency.
A256FE56     //  Just a moment, Detective... Jermaine Jones. The office is listed as 5528 Santa Monica Boulevard.
48EB5145     //  Here we are, Jermaine Jones. 238.
ACB11161     //  Look at this place. 
A4B7DE90     //  I'm guessing not much talent comes out of this talent agency.
F0D6EDB3     //  You boys looking for work? What kind of act is you supposed to be?
BE1996CA     //  Look, it's Laurel and Hardy. Speak to the boss if you want some help.
A534E95C     //  I see a lot of acts go through here. And I'm telling you you're wasting your time.
A8DB39C0     //  You men sure you got the right place? There's nothing here for you.
A8BD8C60     //  We're not hiring. Things a little slow.
0D2DAE4F     //  Hey - 
C8AEDD68     //  who let you in?
36F7D1D9     //  Jermaine Jones.
1D3AEBB4     //  Don't bother getting up. Your flunky Fleetwood Morgan just snitched you out.
9F276E91     //  I wasn't planning to. 
A997E08A     //  Now you think you could tell me who the hell you are?
E3E6FB33     //  LAPD. We'd like to take a look around.
9D364B1B     //  The hell you will, motherfucker. 
9E99A61A     //  You carrying a warrant?
C4F808F7     //  No. Do we need one? 
DE695572     //  Search the place, Cole.
B3C2B3C6     //  You ain't allowed to do this. I got rights.
1EB1F044     //  What do you think you're gonna find, policeman? Huh?
CD07265A     //  Vernon, Wilt!
E5C928A3     //  You heard the boss.
086150CB     //  Clean 'em up quick, boys. I ain't got time for this.
DE1774C9     //  Come on, come on. Beat these sons of bitches down!
E84ADC10     //  Goddamn, I don't believe this. Are you two good for anything?
DBC78324     //  Is this the best you got? These mugs are doped to the eyeballs.
203F53F8     //  Sit tight, asshole. 
865046D3     //  Pretend you're at the parlor getting your nails done. 
0CD47EE4     //  Cole, you'd better search through that stuff in the radio before you brace our friend here. 
B9049336     //  Seems a shame to be using this when you have such a beautiful corner radio.
42FACECE     //  That thing ain't never worked.
279B1EDB     //  I hope none of this stuff is purloined, Mr Jones.
31D9167D     //  I hope none of this stuff is purloined.
00F5D8A3     //  I have a receipt for that thing... 
507795CD     //  somewhere.
EA901666     //  Ramez Removals. They must have taken special care delivering this for you.
52B3C99A     //  Ramez Removals. They must have taken special care delivering this.
71773BFA     //  This must be how those two bums standing guard take their wages.
D1BF1B5A     //  Too much for felony possession. I'm thinking intent to supply.
0C8FDE6F     //  Your friend Fleetwood was also a betting man, Jermaine.
21C5E9BA     //  How many starving musicians pay with perfect, clean fifties?
81A107D7     //  Scott Phantom. A fine radio. Short wave, AM and FM. My father has a Scott.
CFB80593     //  No wonder this thing is sounding a little muffled, Jermaine.
9EBD875D     //  Lamont and Tyree are dead. 
4B4C75B2     //  At a stretch the DA could have you on felony murder for supplying stolen government morphine...
31801386     //  Tyrone and Cornell are dead?
6BE18D05     //  They're on a slab downtown with the ME examining their last meal - 
3E420352     //  popcorn washed down with morphine.
2C69A5F9     //  You offering me a deal?
4FB607E8     //  I have a pet judge who hates blacks. 
B542B28D     //  He'll give you fifty years for your two buddies, another thirty for stealing from Uncle Sam. 
79DC9A71     //  You'll be out by the time you're a hundred and ten. 
81709CAD     //  Imagine the changes you'll see.
4B181165     //  I get the message. 
0A16A9A7     //  How much is this going to cost me?
173B05A9     //  Who supplies the morphine?
F33C36A7     //  I don't know nothing about that.
515B6C69     //  I'm sure the Grand Jury will agree. A name, Jermaine?
F660FF7A     //  These guys don't like to use names. I'm only in this because business is slow.
D3BF4977     //  Looks like it's been slow since 1935.
8DD25C83     //  So we make you for all of it. You're the fall guy for Mickey Cohen.
2FA3A38F     //  In case you haven't noticed, I'm a colored man. You see any Jew boys running around here? I collect my cut. Lenny the Fink controls the action.
74D8004B     //  Lenny who?
2F790953     //  Lenny Finkelstein. Mickey's dipshit brother-in-law.
F6BB0AF5     //  I think you and your cronies are responsible for the theft from the wharves. If you want to save your skin stop lying to us, Jones.
2E82A86B     //  So, I look some kind of criminal genius to you. That what you saying, motherfucker? Prove that I was in San Pedro and that I stole that shit.
F9EF4283     //  You're harassing a colored man because he can't afford the payoffs 
3557FA17     //  those whiteboy gangsters cough up to the LAPD.
474E991D     //  What is the link between the morphine and the numbers slips?
3F98FE2A     //  There is no link. You're wasting your time here.
A57477E0     //  Fleetwood was carrying numbers slips. Your makeshift safe is full of them.
7F9BAB16     //  Is it a revelation to you that poor people play the policy?
127815C4     //  You either rat out the next link in the chain or you spend the rest of your life in jail.
CA54F180     //  Are you gonna put that in writing, asshole?
D8A398BE     //  You're lying to me, Jones. Tell me about Merlon.
D9005759     //  Who? I don't know anyone named Merlon.
2875F2BF     //  Fleetwood Morgan will testify that you and Merlon are expanding out of illegal gambling and into drugs.
DF741331     //  Okay. 
063FFF30     //  So I buy from a cat goes by the name of Merlon Ottie. 
33284549     //  Merlon runs the lottery for the jewboy. 
F1C4568E     //  The Fink has a new line in drugs. 
13D98ADA     //  You squeal me out, I'll deny ever telling you.
E207DFCF     //  Tell us about Ottie.
516AF510     //  Ottie's a gambler. 
93983BDE     //  Fronts points on football games, fights, the horses. 
5EAE654B     //  Numbers. Chicken crossing the road. 
33E61DF4     //  Motherfucker will take the odds on anything.
96C7FA30     //  Unless you cut me a deal over the hop I can't help you.
15765EC3     //  What's the score with Ramez Removals?
5C192C8B     //  I bought a radio from there, that's all.
C484E079     //  The small one, or the special one with the hidden compartment?
C6E761EE     //  Both. What of it?
A4DC413B     //  So when we visit Ramez Removals and tell them we want a special bookcase or wardrobe to hide our dope in, they're going to be copacetic.
E57891B9     //  And when we tell them their good friend Jermaine sent us, 
480EA12C     //  and said they could do a nice deal for the LAPD...
A47748FC     //  I could use an act like you two. 
A3A69436     //  Those fucks Abbott and Costello are on the slide. 
33E5D534     //  Hollywood could use another couple of deeply unfunny whitebread humps like you.
A5F01226     //  Very good, Jermaine. You have character. Now cough it up.
3F3F8A47     //  Ramez is a 'good' friend of Lenny the Fink. You getting the picture?
8AF00345     //  I think Ramez is part of the distribution chain, Jermaine.
61BDB1B8     //  And what have you got that could prove I use Ramez that way?
E6702ED1     //  You are one seriously deluded white boy. Why don't you ask your dapper friend here how the world works?
DE20C7A6     //  I'm a booking agent. Can't you see that I'm busy and don't have time to be wasting with you clowns?
1CAC1E6E     //  Plenty of white crooks for you to roust in this town. Why not leave me alone and try City Hall?
7908C2FD     //  You got that glassy look about you. You sure you're not hopped up or something?
C81E143C     //  This is bullshit. 
2F040EBE     //  I think we're about done talking here, Officer.
342DAC3D     //  Take them all in.
FE173CCB     //  We have a deal, right?
B33711F2     //  We're after the morphine. I'll speak to the DA on your behalf. You have my word.
B190598F     //  I'll take them in and book them. You'll have to do the paperwork.
8C557D98     //  We'll show him some Hollywood hospitality down at the station.
9EDEE00A     //  You can get on with the case. We have this prisoner under control.
D495B0AC     //  We'll get these guys processed and in the can.
3EA8C0D9     //  So Mickey Cohen or Jack Dragna stole the Army surplus morphine, 
445E4ACA     //  and they are selling it on the streets?
9B734EDF     //  Looks that way.
7189B54B     //  But the mob wants return customers, not corpses. Why haven't they cut the morphine?
55967405     //  Good question, Detective.
21BE6BB0     //  This robbery happened months ago, right?
9F149430     //  The beginning of the year.
F61B3CB7     //  So why are the proceeds suddenly turning up now?
E1DC8DC8     //  Another good question. 
2A614C1D     //  But where does it get us? 
6EA8F4FB     //  It's like asking questions in the middle of a movie. 
DB5F9E39     //  If you just sit tight and keep your yap shut you'll find out what happens. 
45039EC5     //  We need to follow the evidence.
99FD7595     //  Welcome to you.
71B429E1     //  No good, policeman. I don't say boo unless Mister Merlon says I can.
E66B48D7     //  I got work to do here, mister.
DC15D097     //  I got nothing to say. Everything we do here is straight up legal.
AACCE4AA     //  If I talk, it'll just make trouble. I'm keeping my damn mouth shut.
9FDFBD27     //  I ain't in charge here, mister. And if I was, I still wouldn't talk to you.
6D4E2A82     //  Shit, I don't know anything. 
B3B5569C     //  Go ask somebody else.
FAC84E05     //  Detectives Phelps and Earle. LAPD.
0ECFE5F7     //  The name's Merlon Ottie. I run a strictly legitimate bookmakers, Detective.
5333FFFB     //  So that's not an illegal wire service that your colleagues are running? And the numbers slips that I've been picking up all morning with this address on them have nothing to do with you?
E5BF24DD     //  I pay my kick to the wops and they pay their cut to the LAPD. You can't go shaking me down.
673D2631     //  You're a loudmouthed motherfucker, aren't you? Anyone ever tell you that criminals are supposed to keep their mouths shut? Stay where you are while we look around.
67309D45     //  That's quite a win for a dime, Merlon.
D4E07A34     //  Goddammit!
F6B19E1F     //  I'd better not get run over here, Merlon!
C032CFDC     //  I'm going right, Cole! Don't you lose him!
E14FCB87     //  Alright, alright. Relax, motherfucker. You got me.
0A4AE076     //  Nice wand, Merlon. Too bad you couldn't pull off your vanishing act.
1C0D614C     //  Make your jokes, smart guy, but don't damage that... that there is a valuable antique.
F1C0B5D2     //  You don't say? Maybe you ought to have a look at this, Cole.
18679F93     //  The cane, Cole. Take a look at it.
CDE4B2F3     //  These are everywhere. Supply must be nearly bottomless.
8769B282     //  Ottie has José Ramez in his pocket. Ramez must have forgotten his lucky numbers.
BDEABBBF     //  Thanks for the paper trail, Merlon.
F6E294A3     //  I think Ramez's place is our next stop.
0790B532     //  With this quantity, we're looking at a high level trafficking charge.
6F51220C     //  Cohen took over the wire service from Siegel, right?
CC1CBBBD     //  Would you like to calculate the odds on you going to prison for a very long time, Merlon?
A300E83C     //  I'm not going nowhere. I've paid my contributions, and I'm not getting hustled by you.
CCB1C511     //  We're only interested in morphine. Army surplus morphine. What do you have to say about that?
0BFB55F3     //  I heard about that. Big robbery on a ship. Ain't my line of work. I prefer something with a sporting outcome.
360F0149     //  Very cute, Merlon. You can be in the spotlight for this, or just a bit part player that the DA hopefully overlooks. How do you want it to play out?
0869FA69     //  Feigned sincerity. I like it. You should move into politics. That shuck of yours will go a long way.
B23D8EE1     //  Okay, Merlon, behave like a moron. The two dead guys. I'm telling the DA that you sold them the hop. Are you hearing this?
05C6DE65     //  Loud and clear, motherfucker. I have chips and I'm not throwing my cards in this easy.
FC8EDF56     //  You distribute for Lenny Finkelstein. 
A5194BE2     //  You're a patsy for those gangsters.
D466EC3A     //  You distribute for the Jews. You're a patsy.
0F846B99     //  I don't know what you're talking about. 
4F7708E0     //  I distribute for the LAPD, motherfucker.
2A225FD6     //  Jermaine Jones gave you up as his supplier. He says that you're Lenny's sissy and that you'll do whatever Lenny tells you.
29D63784     //  Me? 
820C19E6     //  That nigger is a dead man. 
B958C202     //  I move the dope José brings me. José Ramez. 
D30A1C9E     //  I ran a clean numbers racket until those two motherfuckers went into the dope business.
938F2365     //  If this is a shakedown I wish you'd get on with it. I can call my man from 77th Division and have this all cleared up.
AC15234A     //  Ramez seems to owe you a lot of money.
103D2C64     //  We all owe somebody.
AAC1728D     //  So it has nothing to do with the proceeds of the morphine shipment?
6A4CF619     //  It's a gambling debt. The hebes took over the wire service and screwed me. Now I just do what I'm told - run numbers and shift dope. José is no different, he just thinks he is a big man that can run up tabs.
BFFA1840     //  Were you in on the San Pedro robbery? The morphine that vanished from the wharves?
F029FDD1     //  You're barking up the wrong tree. I'm a middleman and my ass is covered.
7A3001C4     //  The truth, Merlon. Do you know that stealing that surplus is a federal beef? That means that all the payoffs will count for nothing if the feds get involved. Do you want that kind of heat?
57236C9B     //  How do you think that you can tie someone like me into a major operation like that?
7EF0789F     //  I'm done jibber-jabbering with you.

6B070828     //  I don't know jack shit about Lenny the Fink, and if I did you would be the last motherfucker on the planet I would talk to about it.
2782D36E     //  So, you run the wire service 
9BF78C9A     //  and distribute dope down the food chain to humps like Jones and Morgan, 
92EA71E2     //  but you have no dealings with Lenny?
A95257C0     //  That's right. That jew bastard thinks the black man is subhuman. He keeps José between me and him and that's the way I like it.
89C155AF     //  Give me something, Merlon, 
3FF14F96     //  or I'll hand you off to the FBI and you can do your stretch in Leavenworth.

9D804646     //  Some of the most convincing people you will ever listen to are born liars. Usually they're called politicians.
1BF9C240     //  I clean cars here, mister. 
F0DCDB35     //  You better speak to the boss.
168F446E     //  Uh... Mr Coombs is over there.
2EDE0C1D     //  Not another step. I have got a Buick Century sedan that would be absolutely perfect for you.
AFD81DCC     //  Detective Phelps, LAPD. Are you the owner?
B6443F9D     //  That's right, Richard Coombs, at your service. You looking to trade in a black and white, boys?
946AE6EF     //  Mr Coombs, we're investigating an auto theft. A man by the name of Cliff Harrison claims he bought the car here.
D28CCC6C     //  Well, some people would say that my cars are a steal... that's a joke, son.
5D97D5A5     //  Very amusing, Mr Coombs.
6CEDC98A     //  I remember Harrison - it was a green, two-tone Kaiser Frazer, if I remember rightly.
8054F551     //  Do you have the bill of sale?
6DBA4364     //  It's in my office. Walk this way...
6DAF4CFB     //  ... that's a joke too, son.
43BB7BA5     //  Phelps, do you mind if I shoot this guy? He's getting on my nerves.
E5F5C35D     //  We have a couple of questions.
5B5CA442     //  Alright, fellas. Shoot.
BAA4097C     //  Here it is. Got the original pink slip there, too.
18282D67     //  Harrison's purchase receipt was legit, at least.
22096AAF     //  Jean Archer. 146 North Fremont Avenue.
3F2D47D1     //  This was all above board?
BEBCCC58     //  Yes, of course it was.
A75860AB     //  What can you tell us about Archer?
0D67E200     //  Somewhat on the simple side. In a big hurry, too.
A3A1AC32     //  Did this look legitimate to you, Coombs?
3F2230EA     //  I'm in used cars, son, not bearer bonds. 
D6860530     //  In my business you don't look a gift horse in the mouth. 
A425A9C0     //  Now, don't come on all high and mighty with me if you want my help.
A7B7AD0C     //  You're lying, Coombs. You knew the car was stolen.
0C0B0278     //  You have some sort of crystal ball tucked in your jacket that can help you prove it?
53BD540A     //  You should try rubbing some oil on that hard head of yours. Are we done here?
3129C2BB     //  Can you tell us how you came to buy the car?
8F139849     //  The girl just wandered in right off the street.
4C73ACE7     //  Nothing unusual about the car?
F21A9FE2     //  Not really my usual type of vehicle - the price was certainly right though. Nice girl, but about as sharp as a bag of wet mice.
55D38D13     //  Did you pay with check or cash?
6478EC22     //  A check. She wanted it made out to cash but I insisted. A man has to watch his cash flow.
40B10069     //  What name?
1FED432B     //  I made it out to Jean Archer on the Bank of Arcadia.
E5160A40     //  You need to give us something, Coombs, if you don't want to be implicated in this.
EC4B0AEB     //  Yap yap yap. 
8D8253E7     //  Son, your problem is that your gums keep flapping but you do no listening.
174C28DE     //  You're lying. You buy stolen cars and then resell them.
8FD4C34B     //  You have some evidence to back up that outrageous aspersion?
20103738     //  Son, you are more mixed up than a feather in a hurricane. I'm getting tired of you.
70A74762     //  Can you describe this Jean Archer?
E55E5FE4     //  Brunette. Maybe twenty-five, twenty-six? A little on the plump side, but not bone ugly.
6F80A673     //  What was your impression of her?
9B17D4DE     //  Kind of harried and harassed. 
17CDA508     //  In a hurry to go somewhere, but no place to go. 
94F982DC     //  You get to know the type.
B02BA2D3     //  So this dizzy broad walks in here off the street and sells you a two year old car for half the price, 
485DBF00     //  and you don't ask any questions?
25F8B6B7     //  I'd say that about sums it up nicely.
1F484B5B     //  You're making this up. There's no Jean Archer. She's fictional, to cover up the fact that you sold a stolen car.
35E2E802     //  How long did you say that you'd been standing out in the sun? I hope you can prove that nefarious allegation.
113D9C1E     //  Go away, son. You're starting to bother me.
B9D35AF2     //  When exactly did you hand over the check, Mr Coombs?
F0EF7333     //  Close of play on Friday.
1A06A655     //  So with the banks closed over the weekend...
5FA88749     //  I might be able to stop payment.
ADE89AAA     //  Why didn't you pay her cash? You knew the car was dirty.
7CC3BA04     //  I had an inkling. When people are in a hurry for money, always pay by check, son. Gives you a couple of days to back out.
E7D7A0AB     //  I think you paid her in cash. This bogus check means that you can claim against your business insurance if it all goes wrong.
CF13AB96     //  You got some way of proving that, sonny?
CD223B85     //  You know, that's a damn good idea. 
1B4F6993     //  I'll have to keep that in mind. 
C54C69B3     //  Meanwhile, are we done here?
30DB47E6     //  Do you know anything about the company that prints these pink slips?
55E9E403     //  Nope. Should I? It isn't exactly my business.
968FD9CC     //  Says Marquee Printing. You've never heard of them?
3ED65C75     //  Marquee? Sure. 
905DB4A1     //  They do all of the government red tape. 
3EA637B1     //  You'll find the place down on Aliso Street, near San Pedro.
318F7A58     //  These pink slips are leading us to something big, Coombs. It's time to stop being cute.
81C8969A     //  I'm going to assume you're having a bad day, son. 
C3529305     //  I sell cars, not paper.
F97EADB5     //  That's a lie, Coombs. 
37CF8271     //  You're printing the slips. 
FB0758DE     //  This whole racket comes back to you.
7B15C038     //  So I'm some kind of criminal kingpin? 
3D46BB92     //  Son, I can't wait to see you prove it.
F998F5D3     //  How about you take it easy, kid. 
9AB9A12C     //  You're going about it like a sailor in a whorehouse. 
9F7CF20F     //  Grabbing whatever you can reach.
669592E2     //  Sure I can't interest you in a nearly new car, son? I'm all but giving them away to servicemen and cops.
7EDC5E58     //  I look for the ideal customer, son, and you ain't halfway dumb enough.
2ABC6F2F     //  You boys sure you got what you came for?
3FC25644     //  You're as thick as a whale sandwich aren't you, son?
CA252696     //  I think we're done talking, friend.
3B6A6033     //  Get out of here, kid. Time is money and you ain't spending.
B7E92D1E     //  Thanks for your help, Mr Coombs. We need to continue the investigation.
F4AE4C49     //  Hope you sort out your problem with Mr Harrison. Go easy on him, son. The boy is about as sharp as a bowling ball. He's built too low - the fast balls fly over his head.
D3A68423     //  Let me shoot this guy. Please?
4E83806A     //  You have a pleasant day, Mr Coombs.
7BC1749D     //  We get awful attentive to people who obstruct LAPD investigations.
31D7ECFE     //  That man is as subtle as a hand grenade in a barrel of oatmeal.
416B51A8     //  Harrison might be off the hook, but we could still run an APB on Jean Archer. Get on the horn and call it in.
32C6512E     //  11K to KGPL. Request an APB on Jean Archer, age approximately twenty-five, on suspicion of grand theft auto.

9DF69EF4     //  I'll relay the information.
561B5784     //  I need an address on a Marquee Printing Company.
8A56B284     //  Marquee Printing Company. Sure. Just a moment... Aliso Street, near San Pedro.
8B09A905     //  Any messages for me?
790B444F     //  A James Belasco is being held at Central Station on suspicion of GTA. Possible link to the Harrison case. They're waiting on you to conduct the interview.
7916701E     //  Thanks for your help.
C90B67E8     //  KGPL calling Car 11K. 11 King, come in.
FFAB08F5     //  11K, go ahead.
4B95AD11     //  11K, go to Central Station. James Belasco held on suspicion of GTA, awaiting questioning. Possible link to the Harrison case. 11K, Code Two.
61A692CA     //  Roger that KGPL. 11K out.
1FA37969     //  Empty. Should have known that Archer broad would have given us a false address.
E4BFD7A5     //  Detectives. Belasco is prepped and ready in Two. 
9626DE89     //  Another stolen car with legit papers.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
2099BFE3     //  You've got an assignment, Phelps. 
2213D3C3     //  Back to it.
04B383A3     //  Can't stop and talk now. You've got places to be.
46D6F908     //  James Belasco?
FF194806     //  I want a lawyer. It's my car and I got the proof right here. Take a look for yourself.
A3883B3B     //  The paper is real enough, Belasco, but the car isn't yours. This pink slip is a forgery.
84E1F881     //  Where were you taking the car, James?
9642DC69     //  Blow it off, greenhorn. You'll get nothing from me.
4A879A42     //  Come on, Belasco. 
670969B9     //  Don't make it hard on yourself.
567A53D3     //  I've got nothing to say till I see an attorney.
0329B646     //  You're a two time loser. 
44B7FBA1     //  If you don't give me something, I'm going to ask the DA for the maximum. 
4ECF2CFE     //  You're looking at ten years, Belasco. 
8690EF0A     //  Kiss your youth goodbye.
EC13AC02     //  I want a deal.
F0A9758B     //  Keep talking and we'll see what sort of deal you're worth.
8F6F596A     //  My job is to drive the cars out of state... Nevada, Arizona, sometimes New Mexico. With the paperwork they provide it's normally a breeze.
66F40A30     //  You were taking the car to Coombs' car yard. He gives you cash and the cars get new papers.
71DCB897     //  Who the fuck is Coombs? What are you talking about?
4C4EB2CD     //  Get me a lawyer. I'm tired of talking to you.
3E1D0F61     //  What happens to the cars once they cross over the state lines?
AB4B18B6     //  I don't know. I just deliver them.
8AB0C619     //  I want to know about the ownership papers. Who do you get them from?
2959A247     //  I pick 'em up along with the car. Always from a different guy, every time.
CBB0DDF8     //  Give me something, Belasco, or I'll take you back to the cells and tell the whole station you're a child molester. How long do you think you'll last?
08A69525     //  Okay, okay. I hear you. 
988EF833     //  The cars get sold in Chicago or back east. 
8ECBFB29     //  Sometimes I bring back cars coming the other way.
DBD4A57C     //  You're lying. You deliver the cars here in LA.
D829CA4D     //  You're going to need more than a guess to pin that one on me.
2F50FB8E     //  I've tried to be helpful, and look how I get treated. I'm not sure I like you.
CAA247AB     //  Where do you pick up the cars, Belasco?
8EC987D5     //  Warehouses. Mainly in East Downtown.
7235651C     //  Come on, Belasco. You must have an address.
D9861373     //  That's not the way they work. They keep moving around. Never the same address twice.
9BD885D3     //  An address, Belasco. You want my help with the DA? Cough it up. Now.
B3A389A3     //  A place on Industrial Street. I don't know the number. You're going to help me out, right?
F3C89EC1     //  Keep talking, kid, and we'll see what we can do.
E78F1E3A     //  You're lying, Belasco. You steal the cars yourself and then provide them to the ring.
C406CC3D     //  I'd like to see you prove that, copper.
A7A37537     //  I'm strictly a wheelman. I know nothing about cars except how to drive them. I don't want to answer any more dumb questions.
E9ED4990     //  Does the name Jean Archer mean anything to you?
C6F653F5     //  Nope. Never heard of her.
BB23417D     //  So she doesn't steal cars?
273517F3     //  Look, I know plenty of dames but I never heard of that one.
4EC1E798     //  You want my partner here to convince you that you do know her?
0691E4F8     //  I'm giving you the straight dope. I don't know no Jean Archer.
F6594DF2     //  You're a liar, James.
682AD6F6     //  Say that again. I'm telling the truth. I don't know the broad.
47CE9B3B     //  Soon as you get tired of this, copper, you let me know.
C2C2819B     //  So that's why you both have the same address printed on your pink slips? 
5378E6A6     //  She's a mule for these stolen vehicles, genius. 
3A1A3FD3     //  Same as you.
B6594D54     //  Jesus. Alright, I know her. Stupidest broad I ever met. Always cooking up crazy schemes. I don't know why those guys use her. You happy now?
A5141C6A     //  Hey! I've got more to say!
9EB7F128     //  I don't gotta tell you jack.
4878804C     //  I've said all I'm going to say.
342676EE     //  You got something to say? Let's hear it.
21F032CA     //  You won't get no more from me. I've had enough.
B3E7F89A     //  Alright, James. We're going to check if this information is worth anything.
AFB646EF     //  And if it is? I need your help here, pal.
B7BFE6F5     //  If it is, then we'll know you're a man of your word. And so will the the DA.
77327FE6     //  You had a chance to cooperate, Belasco. See you in ten years when you get out.
258A9EDB     //  You're Phelps, right?
95F38735     //  Yes, I am. Look, can we do this...
855FC888     //  Ray Pinker. I'm with Technical Services. The pink slips are all real.
B86FB06A     //  Yes, we know that.
640467D7     //  There is only one company that prints them in California. The Marquee Printing Company. They've confirmed that the numbers are legitimate.
F63D5E7F     //  You've checked them out?
4AC2D89C     //  Sure. 
EEA0345A     //  They're on Aliso Street, near the corner of San Pedro. 
6970EC1B     //  The guy I spoke to was Leitvol. 
D8A26C8F     //  Gordon Leitvol. 
AB67F3B4     //  Here - I wrote it down.
E96050CB     //  You're Phelps, right? You had Cliff Harrison booked for GTA?
DF325D00     //  Yes, I am. Look, can we do this later? I'm in the middle of an...
C1B53778     //  Ray Pinker. I'm with Technical Services. Listen - he had a pink slip for the car. I've just finished looking it over, and it's real.
F61CBBF8     //  Are you sure?
CB870E62     //  Absolutely. There is only one company that prints pink slips in California. The Marquee Printing Company. They've confirmed that the numbers are legitimate.
F63D5E7F     //  You've checked them out?
FE3502B3     //  Sure. They're on Aliso Street, near the corner of San Pedro. The guy I spoke to was Leitvol. Gordon Leitvol. Here - I wrote it down.
CCD404D2     //  I thought you were in a hurry. Now you want to talk?
2AD1731E     //  Look, Detective - I've got things of my own to get back to.
B12D646F     //  Phelps! Your GTA suspect - Jean Archer - spotted by a patrolman. Western Union Office, 253 South Hill. Less than a minute away down the street, if you run. Go! She won't hang around.
ABF9FC9F     //  I'm looking for Jean Archer.
A5B5643C     //  Yes, sir. She's already gone. She seemed in a terrible hurry - shouting and cursing. Is there some kind of problem?
1E5C8C5E     //  No problem, ma'am. Thank you for your help.
E79451E1     //  It will only take a little while longer, madam. It's quite a lot of money.
B0B8AAD4     //  What is taking so goddamn long? Give me my money or give me my check back.
2E0ADC38     //  I really don't want to get involved in any police matters.
4CDB8A50     //  I just work here.
FAEC6D1F     //  LAPD. We'll take it from here.
70FD3CC3     //  Goddammit, everyone's against me. Look - just let me get my money and get out of here, okay? You look sweet. How about giving a girl a break? I could be very nice.
819CB366     //  I'm afraid I can't do that, Miss Archer. Stefan, call for a black and white.
3137E2E5     //  Just my luck to get the only hair shirt cop in the LAPD.
2F1B9F8C     //  Detective Bekowsky, badge number eight-seven-five. I need a patrol car to transport a suspect from the Western Union office at 253 South Hill to Central Police Station.
BF3C7D66     //  The car you sold to Coombs was stolen, Miss Archer. There won't be any money.
1127899F     //  I handed over all the right paperwork when I sold it, buster.
FFD7BFCC     //  Calm down, Jean. Just tell me why you sold the car.
027363C1     //  You're sweet - you really are - but just get the fuck out of my way.
3C5844F8     //  Jean, you've blown open the whole operation because you were dumb enough to try to sell one of the cars. What do you think they're going to do to you? Give me something.
EAA3D5E1     //  I was just doing what they do. 
D1A023CC     //  They pay me fifty bucks to drive the car. 
66187679     //  I made two grand selling it.
CDDC724D     //  You made zero, and if they catch you you're dead. Is that all your life's worth?
46834116     //  Look, a girl needs things. I don't see you looking out for me.
B6857F26     //  You're lying, Jean.
521D5E2B     //  You want to prove that, buster? Try and prove that pink slip is not real.
CE2D7D36     //  Look, this is all just a big mistake. I don't want to talk anymore. Just let me go.
661A077B     //  How long have you and Belasco been delivering cars?
25FC74C2     //  Who is James Belasco?
7BB49728     //  I can't help you unless you help me, Miss Archer.
C6FA2188     //  I told you I don't know him. Don't keep banging on about it.
0F81A97E     //  He's your boyfriend. He's the guy you boost cars with. He gave you up. He thinks you're so dumb you'd steal a free sample.
A17F7BDC     //  So I'm no genius. 
AC465BFD     //  I make the best with what I've got. 
F2CE337B     //  Why are you so cruel?
4870320A     //  You're lying. 
F85F53B9     //  James Belasco? 
0F70F9E1     //  I don't remember mentioning his first name, Miss Archer.
C163405D     //  Oh. I... I think you did, didn't you? I'm sure of it. Anyway, I don't know... him.
194D38AC     //  So because you just don't like me you can call me a liar.
8C0C3CF3     //  You aren't sharp enough to lie to me, Jean. You and James Belasco share the same address on your pink slips. We have him in a cell.
84EB26E1     //  Okay, so I know the creep. The pink slips are real. The home addresses are always vacant lots. Bigelow is always boasting that the paperwork is legit and that if we stick to our stories...
43C1E4B6     //  And don't try and sell the car?
C7EA8468     //  Yeah, that too.
F6A4C0BE     //  Tell me where you picked up the car, Miss Archer.
A0764B41     //  Look - I can't remember! Let me go, will you? Please? What have I got to do?
8E5A9492     //  Help me out here, Jean.
7D0F50D6     //  I can help you out. How about the Catholic solution? Nice boy like you would have never tried that. Let me go and you can do it to me. How about it, huh? Any working girl would charge a C-note for that.
68DF3B01     //  As much as that? Sounds on the high side to me, Cole. The car is outside.
C8337092     //  You're trying my patience here, Jean. I'll have the reporters down here and have your picture in all the papers. You'll have nowhere to run.
81C064E4     //  Alright already. I get the message. I pick up the cars from a guy named Bigelow, 58 Industrial Street. Big warehouse full of goons. Now you've got what you want, can I go? Please?
5D9D290E     //  You sure can. We've got a car waiting outside for you.
3558A991     //  You're lying. You remember just fine.
8D1E4255     //  And how exactly do you know that?
F754EFFE     //  Are we finished talking? I'm tired of this.
11115EC6     //  Some career advice, Jean - get out of crime. Marry someone boring who has money and will find you captivating.
E90341CD     //  Is this guy for real?
54BD3B97     //  He takes a little getting used to. But yeah, he generally means what he says.

07413D38     //  Thanks for letting me off, copper.
BC927649     //  You're not getting any help from me.
C672B2BD     //  Forget it, buster. You're leaning on the wrong girl.
E2533252     //  Can we just get this over with?
34963A61     //  Nope. No way. I'm not talking to you. You're in my bad books now.
60CDC837     //  I've met some rotten men in my time, mister, but you take the cake. I'm not saying another word.
EEBEFA80     //  I think we should call for a couple of black and whites. Get Fleischer down here.
F79FF8F1     //  I thought you Marines were gung ho, Cole. 
A681F28A     //  You have a .45... don't you ever want to use it? 
9C5CB055     //  I'll take the back - just give me a few seconds to get around there.
7BF5E85B     //  Cole Phelps, LAPD. 
AE80B73E     //  All of you are coming Downtown with me.
5FF87DB9     //  You think so, huh? Look sharp, it's the cops!
409EBD0B     //  Keep those hands up, shitbird!
DC2F6E79     //  Let's clear the top floor. I don't want to get drilled in the back on the way out.
C108F98B     //  Alright! Alright! Don't shoot!
88C48933     //  Keep your hands up. Watch him, Bekowsky. He doesn't move until I've tossed this place.
2C48533B     //  Better call for a meat wagon.
B4718A57     //  You do it. I'm going to take a look around.
73A0CC08     //  There are enough slips here to keep them stealing cars till Christmas.
88100499     //  Marquee Printing Company. There's nothing like going direct to the source.
28B42EBA     //  Leitvol. We have motive.
5BE64369     //  We've got a trail of pink slips and stolen cars that leads right to your door, Bigelow. You're in this up to your neck, but I don't think you're the man in charge. Make it easy on yourself. Give him up.
86F517A0     //  I do work on cars for customers. You charge in here shooting up the place like it's the Battle of the Bulge. I can't give you anything.
F9D078DA     //  We know about Marquee Printing. You can make this easier on yourself by giving us your man on the inside.
58B46E0D     //  I sometimes repair cars and put them back on the road. I need a pink slip to resell them. There's no problem there.
3D001743     //  So none of these cars are stolen? You just shoot at intruders as a general policy?
3B837CE2     //  Hell, what would you do? You gotta be careful. There's a lot of thieves around.
4D0B7E34     //  Oh, brother. Now I've heard everything.
230360B7     //  There are at least four dead men in this warehouse. A couple more punks won't make for that much extra paperwork. We'd be doing the legal system a favor.
5B916F9B     //  Okay, okay, tough guy, I get the message. Leitvol - the guy who runs Marquee - he's the bigshot. He likes to spend big at the track. He owes people.
784BFD04     //  Don't lie to me. I'm not in the mood for any more lies.
705DEA11     //  The slips are the real deal and I order them from Marquee.
3A4356BF     //  I want a mouthpiece. The organization employs a very good one. He does a great job keeping Mickey C out on the streets.
0A8C6EC3     //  Leitvol - the guy with no luck at the track. Tell me about him.
B67045B9     //  He's one of the guys lying over there. 
8A8B0F96     //  You're right... he has no luck.
E7CFFB26     //  For a car thief, he plunges big at the track.
3C2E7AE0     //  Every dime he gets. He can't help himself.
37D3B78D     //  So if I go over there and check his jacket your story is going to ring true? I'm warning you, Bigelow.
CA8F109E     //  Give it a try, flatfoot. For some reason, none of my guys like to bring ID to work.
A87AF012     //  That's the best lie you can come up with, Bigelow?
99FE2819     //  Hey, would I lie to you, Detective? I'm not exactly in a good position here now, am I?
E1DA3A6B     //  No proof, huh? Looks like your mouth moves faster than your little pencil.
7167A77A     //  Gordon Leitvol owns Marquee Printing. A government print shop. He's losing big at the track.
5A0F9EFC     //  He has these big government contracts. 
7227E720     //  He's in hock over twenty grand. 
4E734C54     //  If the Feds find out, the contracts will be all over. 
1E78EB3C     //  Leitvol plays ball.
40A618B7     //  I'm not saying anything till I've seen a lawyer.
9959219C     //  You'll get nothing from me.
7179AA2A     //  You can't just shoot up my place and leave me here!
68C010B6     //  Spit it out, copper. I ain't got all day.
21C730AC     //  Just how long are we going to do this?
3C1C3E3D     //  Shove it, copper. I'm not talking to you.
BC4EDA38     //  Alright, Bigelow - the heat is off you. Play your cards right and you'll be able to count your time in Quentin on one hand.
97102DE0     //  Whether you give up your bosses or not, Bigelow, you're going away for as long as I can put you there.
C931EB51     //  We'll see. I didn't fire a shot, copper. I just watched you tear my place up.
803AD5DB     //  11K to KGPL, I'm requesting assistance and an ambulance, 58 Industrial Street, shots fired, suspect is down.
E4525544     //  Gordon Leitvol?
5A4344DA     //  That's him at the counter.
9AB6EA80     //  Sorry pal, I'm busy.
452B99CA     //  Go bug someone else, huh?
6874F1F9     //  And what can I do for you, gentlemen?
CE2C401A     //  I'm a Traffic detective from Central Division. Who's in charge here?
FF7AB4F2     //  I am. Gordon Leitvol. What's this about?
60A9EA84     //  We understand that your company prints California vehicle titles?
B1B0AB93     //  Yes. I have the government contract to print pink slips. Have done for some years.
A7097211     //  Have you had any goods or equipment stolen recently? We're running up against stolen cars with seemingly legitimate paperwork.
7DABE3CC     //  Not recently. 
99975817     //  Have you ruled out forgery? There's no shortage of talented artists in this town.
A5D3477B     //  We'll keep it in mind.
E87B8632     //  What do you want this time?
72C59FB4     //  We have some questions for you, Mr Leitvol.
2EE7EC3F     //  Do you have a delivery ledger, Mr Leitvol? We would like to cross-check against the Coombs Automotive Emporium.
EE0069A7     //  It's a little out of the ordinary, Detective. I'm not sure I can share those sorts of records.
DB536BAA     //  Surely that isn't confidential information, Mr Leitvol?
B2AF035E     //  Not for me to say. 
073604E4     //  It would be better if you got permission from my clients.
E470AA80     //  Hand it over, Leitvol. You don't want us having bad thoughts about you, do you?
5F9B01EF     //  Very well. But this really is irregular. Over here.
FB775126     //  I think you're deliberately hiding those records, Leitvol. Cough them up.
53214679     //  I'm sorry? What evidence do you have for that?
0B39D522     //  You really don't have the first idea what you're doing, do you?
234C1528     //  Look for patterns, recurring names, unusual addresses. Anything out of the ordinary.
AF8C0B78     //  You certainly encourage repeat business, Leitvol. This Mr Bigelow is a good customer.
DC76C095     //  Mr Leitvol, we're currently working two auto theft cases. Do you know anything about a car theft ring?
45E7B63D     //  Certainly not! 
89DEE8C5     //  Why would I get mixed up in a thing like that?
B0DE5E77     //  I'm not accusing you of being involved, Mr Leitvol. I just wondered whether you had heard anything.
C9AEAF53     //  Yes, I see. 
4823340A     //  We have had attempts to break in here before. 
851206E1     //  A lot of the government forms here have value to criminals.
B3980484     //  We have suspects with legitimate pink slips that were printed here, Leitvol. You better give me something before I bring the whole department down here.
5F423633     //  Don't be hysterical, Detective. As a matter of fact we had a similar problem a couple of years ago. A number of used car lots were selling blank documents to a criminal organization.
8553B338     //  I think you're in this up to your neck, Leitvol.
C1102874     //  You're out of your mind. What an allegation! I'll report you to your superiors. The Chief of Police is a very good friend of mine.
19E0D9DB     //  A very heartfelt and genuine apology is in order from you, young man.
E5254A86     //  Do the names Cliff Harrison and James Belasco mean anything to you?
50E805E7     //  No, they do not.
D605C088     //  You sure you don't know either of them?
535D2EF7     //  Never heard of either gentleman.
CCE16A7A     //  Harrison bought his car from Coombs. The pink slip looks good and that points the finger here. Do you have any employee trouble?
A7F33B5B     //  No, I don't. They've all been carefully screened. 
38B48E74     //  Look, now that I think about it the name Coombs sounds familiar. 
ED568F55     //  I think they may have been involved in stolen documents in the past.
D4261349     //  You sure about that, Mr Leitvol? You sure you never heard of them?
3122F2CD     //  Are you making an accusation, young man? 
5E825BE8     //  Do you have any kind of proof?
70B8AADD     //  My word is my bond. 
0ECB7929     //  Character is in short supply these days. 
A8ADAD0F     //  You could do with gaining a little.
A2D55E3B     //  Sorry to bother you, sir. We'll let you know if there are any developments.
B8AAA7CD     //  For somebody with government contracts we were expecting a lot more cooperation, Mr Leitvol. This doesn't look good.
E8554D08     //  Hold on, Phelps. No way that creep gets to stonewall us. We need to go back in there and search out those delivery records ourselves.
CA45A0F7     //  You're under arrest.
C29397C8     //  You again? This harassment is starting to wear thin.
88F0B591     //  I'm sorry? Just what the hell are you talking about?
310A9C1A     //  We found a box of pink slips in a warehouse full of hot cars. You signed for them, Leitvol.
95D7DFE2     //  I sign for all the orders and deliveries. You'll need something better than that, cowboy.
70B16323     //  I'm giving you a chance here, Leitvol. A chance to come clean. Your reputation, your business... you'll be ruined.
CB42D3F6     //  You'll be lucky to get a job back on the beat once I've spoken to the Chief and the Mayor. You're the one who should be worried, Officer.
E90847D4     //  Your money and influence will be worthless in San Quentin. If you don't go crazy in the first couple of months then you'll probably get knifed in the chow line. Is that what you want?
6B7A01A5     //  Save it for the suckers, Detective. You'll get nothing from me.
C8D2C475     //  Save it, Leitvol. We already have all we need to send you down.
5756CBFD     //  I've had enough of this. You either produce some shred of proof or I call my attorney.
44655ACF     //  What you're doing here is slanderous, Detective, and you'll be hearing from my lawyer about it.
57780726     //  You're in the hole with the organization. We know about the debts, Leitvol.
21EFF5B4     //  I agree I have a small problem. 
207E4633     //  I'm prepared to help you in any way I can, Detective. 
4E013534     //  I'll name names.
A0659D62     //   I need you to keep this out of the paper.
3BFAA179     //   I need...
D69F648B     //  You need to shut up now, Leitvol.
639EFBD0     //  Listen, I'm busy. 
67FBCBA2     //  You know where the door is.
7FC0EC35     //  Well, I trust you've got all that you need.
65F24029     //  Good luck, I suppose.
87B67FAA     //  This interview is finished. You, Detective, are in a lot of trouble.
0176B687     //  I'm going to be calling my lawyer, then I'll be transcribing everything that just happened here.
B75A87D9     //  Gordon Leitvol, I'm charging you with conspiracy and fraud. Hands behind your back.
EECBF57B     //  Let's check out this address. See if the stolen Frazer is still there.
5F0D7860     //  What are you doing? Back there and chase him, Phelps!
3A879510     //  See what his story is, and get ready for a real whopper.
B59DF801     //  We need to get to Coombs Auto and check out Harrison's story.
5BC92C28     //  We're missing something at Coombs Auto, Phelps. 
A22D3790     //  Let's pay them another visit.
C08368D9     //  Alright, find out what Coombs knows about our leadfooted friend Cliff Harrison.
EAC95ABF     //  Did you double check all the paperwork? Who's it made out to?
20DA8A36     //  Please, Phelps - I'm begging you. Get the information we need out of this clown, and then we can leave.
9CA7C641     //  Let's get the APB out. We stand a good chance of netting this girl.
CF1A76D3     //  We could always try the address Archer gave. Maybe she's dumb enough to be sitting at home waiting for us.
0D99FBC0     //  Sounds like James Belasco was picked up the same as Harrison. 
8E066B77     //  Let's get down to Central and hear his excuse.
57DDADDA     //  We're wasting an opportunity if we don't go to Central and hear Belasco out. He's involved in this.
3A8A41A8     //  Let's get the interview started. If we do this right, who knows what Belasco might roll over on.
C5203385     //  You know the broad isn't going to hang around, Phelps. 
E6926227     //  Let's get to the Western Union office.
3CD33AA6     //  We can't just let Jean skate. Back to Western Union. Quick.
1AB0AC34     //  Talk to Archer, but be careful.
4750F92E     //  We missed her. Ask the lady at the counter what happened.
821B1E69     //  Try the Marquee Printing place? No harm in following the paper trail.
D3DCC2DA     //  The lead on the pink slips might not have legs, Phelps, but we should give it a chance. 
616B196D     //  Back to Marquee.
46D6A99E     //  We need to talk to the guy in charge.
65A65A1E     //  I say it's time to bust open the warehouse.
37117C92     //  Come on, Phelps - that shitstorm on Industrial Street hasn't blown over yet. Let's get back there.
875F91D2     //  See what Bigelow has to say about all the bullets flying around this place.
DEF9F4E5     //  Search the place, Phelps. We're looking for paper, records - any kind of bankable evidence.
D3EE2CAF     //  Get what you can out of Bigelow now, before the black and whites take him away.
652BDEE2     //  We go back to Leitvol. The amount of evidence we've got, his goose is cooked.
2657921B     //  Back to the Marquee printing company. I'd love to nail that son of a bitch Leitvol.
CD80EE68     //  Be smart when you talk to Leitvol, Phelps. He's been running this game for a while.
E93EE7C0     //  Are we cops or not, Phelps? If we want to search this place he can't stop us.
96F3350D     //  Leitvol doesn't have a leg to stand on. Get a confession out of him, Phelps. Let's put this case to bed.
AF0A418F     //  'The LAPD's Central Traffic division has today smashed a nation wide 
BED6348F     //  auto theft ring, writes crime correspondent...' blah blah blah... 
3D64F2E5     //  here it is - 'Traffic Squad detectives confronted a large group of armed thugs...

E50C70C1     //  Damn fine work, Phelps. 
7C74A689     //  Get out there and nail some more bad guys will ya... 
19A7EF55     //  I want to finish reading this.
BBFD1000     //  Now where shall I start? 
8B1E6FB9     //  With the two GTA suspects we had to let walk free? 
0BB4EDFB     //  Or with the female suspect who, I am reliably told,
DDC36DA2     //  slipped the leash with embarrassing ease?
925D0808     //  You just lost the chance to crack one of the biggest criminal operations in this city.

7E9B2CEA     //  Address is 6 West Second Street. 
66F8B03E     //  Get over there and see what you can find out. 
FA6292B8     //  Go on, sorry to inconvenience you.
48DA3D2A     //  Try the door at the end. I heard something.
247E435C     //  We're on it, Captain.
BFC4D480     //  Thanks, Ray. This is a great lead. We'll get down there as soon as we can.
8F262F0E     //  Out of the car, now!
B79956B3     //  I like your thinking, Phelps. Call it evidence. The guy's an asshole. He can pick it up from the pound.
9B4BE262     //  Let’s go. We need to get Leitvol behind bars.
E574713C     //  Come on, we don’t want to lose her.
32FCCCF2     //  I say we go check out the printing company.
ECE0DFC8     //  I think it's time we paid Mr Bigelow a visit.
A5609679     //  I swear the more bent cars we bring in, the longer the hot sheet gets.
9EDE34BC     //  I'm not sure she'd agree with you.
073B9921     //  It pays the rent, though. Keeps Mrs Phelps in the manner to which she's accustomed.

765FBA0C     //  We should go to the station, see what this Belasco guy has to say.
4DE9FB89     //  The paperwork all looked above board. And he seemed like a clean cut kid.
8F5C0385     //  Oh, I get it now. You see some kid who's basically you 5 years ago and assume he's gotta be innocent.
09A220E1     //  I'm more than happy to be proved wrong.
2DD3EFED     //  Hey, if he'd been black or Hispanic, you'd be singing a different tune. You spout all this communist crap about treating everybody the same, but it only works one way.
EE2B4986     //  I'm not sure that's communism, Stefan.
32126533     //  Oh god, please. Not another history lesson from the man who single-handedly won the war.
B06DA154     //  Are you finished?
C4610F28     //  Yes, I feel much better now. We'll shake down the car dealer and take it from there. Unless his daddy plays golf with yours, of course, in which case we'll give him a firm gentleman's handshake and be on our way.
B66F8462     //  See, I knew you weren't finished.
AADEB55E     //  Here's a chicken and egg question for you. Do you think you have to be an asshole to sell cars or that selling cars turns you into an asshole.

4570F6FA     //  I've always got it in for car salesmen, doesn't matter what day it is. And why do they always think they're comedians when they're about as funny as a heart attack?

9F79A67A     //  I'm married.
6109B16B     //  I know that. But you're not blind or dead inside, are you? Wait, scrap that second half of the question.

40CA2921     //  Date: August 15th, 1947
4FEC8E81     //  Status of Subject: Treatment and observation, ongoing.
08BD8AC3     //  Personal History:
56A27A83     //  The subject was born into an Oklahoman sharecrop farming family.
CC1E3196     //  Failed harvests during the 'dustbowls' of the 1930's led to the family being evicted, and they undertook
A001D2A5     //  the journey west to California.
1CFBB025     //  The subject's mother and younger brother both died of starvation while on the road.
2F8BBEF9     //  The subject's father found work as a stunt man in low budget cowboy films.
06F728A9     //  The subject was urged to pursue the same career, but a naturally reserved disposition
675DDFD3     //  combined with physical awkwardness made this difficult.
C370CE9A     //  The subject trained as a gas fitter and showed some mechanical aptitude
2C8D94B0     //  but was drafted into the Marines at the outbreak of the war.
6784FF14     //  He served as a <OBSCURED> until an incident <OBSCURED>
3EDFBF0B     //  The subject's father died in November 1945.
585BCE75     //  The subject returned from service to live alone on the property father and son once shared.
4F91B58C     //  Nature of Disorder:
22F8F108     //  When referred to this physician, the subject was suffering from an acute case of battle fatigue,
AB5FF201     //  manifested in sensory flashbacks, disturbed attention and sleep disturbance.
36C893A0     //  The subject described symptoms such as
EBEB3BF3     //  vision impairment, headache, tachypnoea, tachycardia and excessive sweating.
96DEB0C2     //  The subject experienced phantom physical sensations when in a wakeful state,
ECE2B80D     //  and intense nightmares when sleeping.
13B72A11     //  The subject was unable to dissociate memory from reality,
871C5CDC     //  frequently regressing to the trauma of the <OBSCURED>.
64D15D4C     //  During early diagnostic sessions the subject admitted to feeling
7988656E     //  a morbid fear of – and deep fascination with – fire.
258487C7     //  Conclusions:
CA7E7713     //  A determination was made that the subject had entered an advanced
28A71E43     //  state of catatonia which could not be overcome by psychotherapy alone.
32B92273     //  Treatment History:
5F6ED353     //  The subject began a course of drug treatment in conjunction with clinical hypnotherapy sessions.
1CC7CAD4     //  Sessions were initially scheduled once every two weeks.
6C457F61     //  Morphine tartrate (<OBSCURED> cc in doses <OBSCURED>) was administered to counteract
ADC36E4F     //  symptoms of anxiety while hypnotic induction and verbal suggestion techniques were applied.
EBF11FD7     //  Treatment was initially ineffective.
5CC99FE0     //  The subject reported no change in the frequency or severity of flashback episodes and headaches.
B176D4FA     //  Additional sessions were scheduled in two-hour blocks to allow
F6FA66E8     //  deeper sedation(morphine tartrate <OBSCURED> cc in doses <OBSCURED>) and increased responsiveness.
F50E065B     //  The subject began to experience a slight decrease in some physical symptoms,
06751075     //  but became highly susceptible to suggestion and ideation.
AFB2FD92     //  As a result, the subject was kept at this physician's clinic more frequently
92203AF4     //  in order to prevent him harming himself or others.
0355CBC0     //  Additional medication was prescribed and sessions were scheduled once every three to four days.
0E894D9B     //  Catharsis exercises were undertaken, where the subject <OBSCURED> in a controlled environment
2124090F     //  and <OBSCURED> The subject reported conflict between feelings of hopelessness,
C3EAAB03     //  and feelings of serenity brought on by special volunteer work undertaken on this physician's behalf.
5A6FFE3B     //  Prognosis:
7DFCD6D0     //  The subject is fighting persistent delusions and paranoid-schizoid tendencies and managing,
1A11A4CC     //  with the help of drug treatment and therapy, to keep them at bay.
7AC93BDB     //  However, it is the opinion of this physician that any relaxation of these treatments would be dangerous.
9D7D47BF     //  The subject could, without continued guidance, slip back into the clutches of his many demons
B7090176     //  and enter a new, anti-social state of psychopathy.

0908BF9C     //  I'm sure you have.
87BA5DE1     //  Save it for the suckers, Candy. Albert won big. 
5B74A1FD     //  He may not have told you, 
39E8C0BD     //  but you don't strike me as the type who leaves town when there's money to be had.
1EBB54B8     //  Call me anything you like, flatfoot. I'm done with this berg and all the cheap chiselers who live here.
B99D8D58     //  You're lying, Candy. You were in his hotel room. He came back after the fight and you weren't there. What happened?
FBF2CE41     //  You can't prove that I was in the room.
3A08F53B     //  How do you think we found you, Candy? You wrote your name and address on a coupon.
D3FCDC54     //  Look - Albert was supposed to take a fall. We were all supposed to make a little money out of it. But Albert got too goddamned stubborn, said his pride was all he had left. So I told him, shove it. Let's see his pride keep him warm at night.
F337DB04     //  So you walked out before the fight?
CC776BE2     //  Yes I did. What's the problem? I didn't take anything.
BA2D9C74     //  What'd I tell you? I shouldn't be surprised at you taking his side. You boys all stick together. What about some sympathy for me, huh?
16BA6069     //  Do the names Harry, Mervin or Ray mean anything to you?
926ABC0D     //  Could be anybody. How the hell would I know?
64E9743E     //  Your friend Carlo seems to be looking for them too.
3CDE77B2     //  Carlo is no friend of mine. He was no friend of Albert's either.
B40ED1FF     //  Give up these men, Miss Edwards, and we'll think about letting these charges against you slide.
0D80C3AA     //  What? Charges against me? 
02BB9FCD     //  All I did was try and look out for Albert. 
25108896     //  Now he skips out, and I have to take beatings for him as well.
A0769BEE     //  They're bookmakers, aren't they? Tell me the truth.
E7C64B6C     //  How the hell would I know?
8434FDD3     //  Albert wrote his winnings down on a notepad in the hotel room. We found the odds in his locker. Who has the betting slips?
C274F886     //  That son of a bitch Albert. Everyone thought he was dumb, including me, but he beat them all.
EB0E28EA     //  Those names could mean just about anything, mister. Seems Albert had lots of secrets he wasn't sharing.
357A449D     //  You're leaving town, Miss Edwards?
489E3BC1     //  Yes, I'm going straight home.
3222E004     //  And you're not planning to meet Albert?
A8848AF6     //  No I am not. 
3E26BFA2     //  I've saved up a little money and I'm going to open a dress shop.
F1CB2B8D     //  Albert is going home by boat as soon as he collects his winnings. I know you're going to meet him.
1B00926D     //  Albert is going to collect nothing. He'll be lucky if he can get out of town in one piece.
5CB03195     //  How will you fare any better? They already believe you're in on it.
0C4AC5F1     //  Hell, I know you're in on it.
5D36F1D4     //  You can think what you want, buster. I'll take my chances. I got a few errands to run, and then I say adios to this dump.
0D1D5B6D     //  You're lying to me. Albert finally won a big fight. I say good luck to him. But you know where he is. Let me help him, Candy.
5F8FE0C7     //  Do all you cops run off at the mouth? Prove I know where he is.
29F13DF1     //  I don't know where he is. And if I did I wouldn't tell you.
FBCEA66A     //  Do you want to press charges against Arquero?
676429F5     //  Just get him out of here. That's all I want.

34F4E117     //  Good luck, Miss Edwards. I hope things work out for you.
48E78FD7     //  Thank you. That's very kind of you to say so.
B6DF2530     //  Bad people are looking to hurt Candy and yet she's not heading straight for the train station?

E2DC0956     //  I don't have time for men like you anymore. Can you just get on with it?
DBD54D16     //  Look, sweetheart - the meter is running. Can you get out of here?
21F64D1D     //  You gonna stand around here all day? A girl's got things to do.
8F957F4A     //  Let's just get this over with, and you can haul Carlo the hell out of here.
D2F9DC9D     //  I tried being helpful. You know, I really did. But you have a special line in bullshit, Detective.

6C198C08     //  She's looking straight at us, Cole. Can you quit fooling around already?
801A0D77     //  Damn. She'll skip town within the hour. How are we supposed to find Hammond now? How am I supposed to get my money back?
641F92B9     //  Great. Let's just set up fucking camp and see if she wanders past. Nice work, Cole.
01E9F73C     //  Bookmakers?
4A9F36D2     //  Yes. Surprise, surprise.

9558661E     //  How much did she collect?

47658F13     //  On the Hammond - Kid Galahad fight?
0300FD21     //  You got it. I'm not complaining - we all made a lot of money on that one. Huge plunge on Galahad and then Hammond knocks the bum out.
13A68173     //  So she collected the money and went out through the back door?
30787AAA     //  Nope. She made a phone call over there, wrote something on a notepad, and then left.
C4885F1F     //  No good, Cole, she's gone. Trail's cold. There must be something inside that can give us a lead.
E98ABDA3     //  What are you doing?
8F61BBEC     //  An old intelligence trick from the Marines.
D1FFCE22     //  We know where she's headed. Let's get moving.

9659F224     //  Otherwise, I can't help you.

61973BC3     //  And Candy is picking up the winnings. Smart play.

41129D70     //  Relax, Cole. You just have a blonde in here, Mervin?
9E6ADB9E     //  Sure did. I'm just about to close up. She took me to the cleaners. Four thousand clams and change.
A45D0792     //  Do you have any idea who Ray is?
07EA4535     //  Sugar Ray?
45E1C6E1     //  Not now, Mervin. Cole doesn't have much of a sense of humor at the best of times.
5FB63E85     //  Ray runs a shop up on North Cherokee Avenue, just south of Hollywood Boulevard.
E8FCB1EF     //  How long ago did she leave?
71C178AC     //  Maybe five minutes. Called a cab. Asked for a number, I told her there was a card over there by the phone.
F0DBA7D0     //  Yellow Cab. We need to get after her. Fast.
A1CBF0B2     //  This is Detective Phelps, LAPD. You dispatched a cab to 61 Hollywood.

A1C87BC6     //  Pull over - she's heading inside.
37B2DF09     //  I think I just saw Hammond. I'll tail him - you get in there and stay with Candy. Make sure you don't let her see you.
3C7B2568     //  Roy!
EA3CAB95     //  Call an ambulance.
2FF1DE86     //  Hammond got away.
4976876C     //  He... he said... told me I... make me pay... Ca... Car... I don't... don't want... help... please...
EA2F4ED9     //  Just try and sit still, Candy. 
8D685DA2     //  Who shot you? Was it Albert?

5DA9BC9D     //  I told you that cocksucker was a crook.
BD7B3E7C     //  The other half of the ticket.
A1D4FFA0     //  The Egyptian Theatre.
478B9104     //  .32 caliber. One shot fired.
10D3B0F4     //  One in the heart. Wasn't taking any chances.

2D4A9E18     //  Following a hunch.
8A25B974     //  This seems like a long shot.

55CB212E     //  Why did you kill her, Carlo? Your gripe was with me.
BD85B64D     //  She was collecting the money for you. Mickey made it clear it was either me or you, and I intend to keep on living.
298B43C3     //  She stole those betting slips.
77140161     //  She was running out on me.
C604EDBC     //  And you were going to let her?

87758E98     //  If I lost a fight...
C818FCD1     //  it wasn't for lack of trying.

BBF7193A     //  I did it for you and that's how you repay me?
C2BF6CD2     //  You did it for yourself.

B28C28B6     //  Candy did it to make her dream come true.
9448CEB4     //  Blah, blah, blah. I've got the money, all I need to do is get rid of you. It's going to be a shame, kid, but that's business.

C65C9BA3     //  Let's get in there and collect.
8777DE11     //  Donelly and the Homicide Squad send their best, Phelps. They're more than pleased that you wrapped up the Edwards killing. They're a little mystified about the motive. You have any ideas on that?
7FAC9A54     //  Crime of passion, sir. Looks like some sort of love triangle between the manager, the fighter and his girlfriend.
37F39643     //  No sign of the scrapper?

DC221C8B     //  The theater I guess, we don't have much else to go on.
E9BF3AD8     //  You don't think there's something we ought to be doing at the Interstate terminal?
EB399507     //  Thanks, pal. And no sudden calls to 207. We don't want to ruin the surprise.

A2ED5A4E     //  The proximity to the scene, plus the bloodstains... 
D62CF82E     //  no way is this coincidence.
020AF890     //  He clearly wants us to find these things. He's left them for us.
CE4D03CE     //  There you go, Phelps. We got a new MO. I told you it wasn't our guy.
1BBD0449     //  Or he might just be getting more confident.
0621C77A     //  Enamelled and gold plated. This was precious to her.
340599F6     //  House keys. Strung up like bait on a hook.
8867195B     //  It's got to be a code or a cipher.
7A5C119C     //  Empty. Where is all this meant to be taking us?
9C6EE822     //  Mrs A Maldonado. Could it be Antonia Maldonado?
6D2D0F75     //  On it goes...
53E94362     //  Where are you taking us?
BCFCB3A2     //  The trail points up.
9815C50F     //  Pulled from the finger and hung up here. What's the significance?
C06C62D0     //  Looks as though the killer was decorating with this.
4D7A1E42     //  Mrs Antonia Maldonado. 712 North Hill Street, Downtown.
56C76052     //  She was only twenty one years old.
1EBCD1B7     //  She was only twenty one years old. But why the library card? Did he want us to find it?
6C138735     //  Son of a bitch wants her identified.
5EB5234C     //  It was Mrs Maldonado, right?
1985A529     //  That's affirmative.
D799D5DB     //  Alright, so then there's a husband we should be looking for. Get him, we've closed the case.
B481D651     //  Ah, Rusty's Razor, of course. I don't want to question your tried and tested techniques, Detective Galloway, but doesn't the DA require sound case work before he'll close the book?
1B223AD7     //  Not if he's got a confession. And you know, there's ways of getting those.
001045B6     //  I'm sure.
1F817100     //  Wait just a moment...
43492426     //  I'm sorry, can I help you?
856E66D6     //  LAPD, ma'am. Detective Phelps and Galloway. Does Mrs Maldonado live here?
64C6FB56     //  Yes, she does.
AE48CE2A     //   I'm Mrs Barbara Lapenti, the owner of this boarding house. Is there a problem?
711F6405     //  I'm afraid so, ma'am. Do you mind if we come in? Is there somewhere we can discuss this?
2BE601C7     //  Of course. Follow me through to the parlor.
47666261     //  Wipe your feet as you come in, detectives. 
EFA1CF00     //  It's this way.
249128D5     //  Mrs Maldonado was found dead this morning.
4547C497     //  Dead. Oh no... she can't be...
582B2FCE     //  I'm afraid she was murdered, ma'am.
45ED869E     //  We need to take a look at her things.
1D6D6F43     //  I'm afraid she was murdered, ma'am. 
45ED869E     //  We need to take a look at her things.
B1BCE990     //  I can't believe it. A person seems so alive... and then they're gone. 
1DE3C5B7     //  Antonia's room is upstairs. 
85975F2E     //  Last door on the left.
FE4E2197     //  Thank you. We'll be back shortly.
FB3C8CE6     //  Will you look at that?
EF2CA81D     //   Someone's turned the place over.
0210E127     //  Alright... excuse us a moment, ma’am.
AFAE8FA3     //  The smashed window explains why the place looks tossed.
4D4F6C32     //  You know how I feel about windows, Phelps.
03098BCC     //  So someone broke in using this thing instead of a crowbar. Wonder where it was taken from?
8BF20B54     //  Okay, we have an address.
9C76263F     //  She had already filed against her husband.
C49CE58C     //  The charm bracelet wasn't among the crime scene evidence.
D5DCF22C     //  Let’s go talk to her.
1E140CF4     //  We have some questions, ma'am, if you're up to it.
99B31CF3     //  Yes, Detective. I'll do my best.
7963435A     //  You've had a break in?
767719F2     //  No. That can't be true.
CA738D3C     //  The back window is broken.
C560A3AD     //  It's happened a number of times. 
E80B4E40     //  The man out back uses his lawnmower, and I'm afraid it picks up stones. 
2D97411E     //  He's always paid for the damage.
336A1BB6     //  The window's broken. 
E9C1A272     //  The room's been tossed. 
CA569A9D     //  You seem like the type of landlady who notices everything that happens under her roof. What gives?
A8987DF9     //  Don't take that tone of voice with me, young man.
F91C2308     //  You're being economical with the truth, Mrs Lapenti. What do you have to hide?
238C04EB     //  I have no idea what you are talking about.
A6E8F65C     //  So Antonia lost her keys and used an iron bar to jimmy the back window?
4369C998     //  I heard a noise in the early hours of the morning. 
D267A950     //  I thought it might be a raccoon at the milk bottles. 
6C8022E8     //  It would be very bad for business if this news got out. 
6E147EC5     //  I have a reputation to protect.
D859DC0E     //  You should be ashamed of yourself, talking to me like that.
DB4FD8C2     //  What time did Antonia go out yesterday?
2012EA71     //  She left around nine.
A962DCEF     //  Do you know where she went?
694A1874     //  No, I... I have no idea. 
C8CC78EE     //  She was a good girl, but she didn't confide in me.
D1E0B078     //  Come on, Mrs Lapenti. You must have some idea.
E1C46324     //  Maybe a movie? Maybe church? 
D5E57DA4     //  She was a very religious girl.
944FCFAA     //  A nosey old hag like you knows everything about the people who live under her roof. Where did she go?
12807C58     //  I think she went to a bar. 
AA256BF9     //  She had been drinking quite a lot lately.
DC56F65D     //  This bar have a name?
934E5AB4     //  El Dorado Bar.
CEB93DE0     //   It's a Latino place on North Los Angeles Street.
F5D5D454     //  That's only a couple of blocks from where we found the body.
3785D3B8     //  Tell me the truth. You know where she went, and why she went there.
5FF23BA1     //  You'd best keep your attitude under control, young man.
E3768709     //   You have some proof of what you're saying?
668535AE     //  I've had a great shock and I am deeply disappointed in you. 
025A2E5B     //   I don't think I want to answer any more questions.
48DE608D     //  Antonia and her husband were estranged?
CDD3F030     //  Yes. 
04817D96     //  She moved here after she separated from her husband two months ago.
CAFBE297     //  But Antonia still wore a wedding ring?
D3DA8ACE     //  She wore the wedding ring, and a necklace. 
A2BDFF08     //  She always wore a religious necklace. 
37D0C6B3     //  That's about all of her jewelry.
828D2BC5     //  Can you describe the necklace?
75612887     //  An icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe.
363B0A40     //   It's quite beautiful - I let Antonia hang a painting of her there on the wall.
0BF6083D     //  We didn't find any jewelry upstairs. You haven't pocketed any evidence, have you?
5592B33E     //  That's outrageous. Are you accusing me of theft?
60AC7638     //  What about her bracelet?
D437363A     //  I don't know anything about a bracelet.
2529B19C     //  What kind of person do you think I am, Detective? 
2ED59A29     //  I would never conceal anything that might help you find poor Antonia's killer.
8DA2B9BA     //  In her wedding photo she's displaying a charm bracelet.
C9286149     //  That thing? She never wore it. He gave it to her. 
4636B7BA     //  She always kept it in that wooden jewelry box.
2CFB305F     //  Do you have any idea who might have wanted to hurt Mrs Maldonado?
9228AB96     //  That rat of a husband, Angel...
691D4370     //   she was serving him divorce papers.
5622EA4C     //  If I killed every wife that served me papers I'd be a mass murderer.
5F896B09     //  Are you being flippant, young man?
1C65CABA     //  No, ma'am.
C4C25A39     //  What can you tell us about Angel Maldonado?
F73A4C54     //  She married him when she was seventeen. 
90993F3D     //  He was cruel to her. Very cruel. 
A1CDCD72     //   She was a good girl. 
2940024D     //  A little on the religious side, but a good girl.
0BE71CE9     //  She ever bring anyone else home?
395D2B40     //  No, she did not. 
37F8C23C     //  What kind of a place do you think I'm running here?
D6B0E228     //  I think this whole thing was a put up job. 
B1D306BF     //  You heard about Antonia over the radio, 
B7E5A680     //  and you made it look like a break in so that you could lift some of her things.
99B3FB35     //  And you have an ounce of proof for that scurrilous allegation?
0CB676E4     //  You're supposed to be doing the Lord's work and tracking down a killer,
881630DD     //   but instead you come in here and you abuse an old woman. 
5E9C8120     //  You should take a long hard look at yourself, young man.
AF68C2C2     //  Thanks, ma'am. You've been very helpful.
C5176E46     //  Pay a call to that husband of hers, lock him up and throw away the key.
D2AA84EA     //  We're hunting a killer, madam. I would have expected a little more cooperation.
B96901CE     //  So Antonia's necklace would match this image pretty closely.
A652E870     //  You owe it to Antonia to hear me out.
705893F5     //  I'm sorry, but if you're done? I have a house to clean.
53D7FBBC     //  Antonia was so innocent, Detective. Catch this killer.
94FAD09D     //  Hey! Get moving!
FCFC7B3B     //  Tell your department to send another detective. 
D4F6EE01     //  One who has some manners, and is actually interested in helping poor Antonia. 
16C1A54B     //  I won't say anything else to you.
44DA66CF     //  A nosey old hag? 
28AF70ED     //  Ha! And I thought I was coming on strong with the ex-wives line.
04801E13     //  Sometimes you have to be firm to get the information you need.
68DC1C88     //  Goddammit, ain't that the truth.
E274F9C5     //  You don't think it's strange that all these murders are happening to girls who've been out drinking?
FB9A5D35     //  No, no. A broad drinks, she gets a bit tight, she starts mouthing off. This leads to that, and she ends up in an alleyway. It's a sad story but this town has seen it play out a thousand times, Cole.
68CDDA48     //  Why don't you want to see a connection here?
F568CB40     //  Because there are perfectly good, real life suspects for every one of these murders. We don't need to go looking for the monster under the bed.
B6624455     //  How about we drop in on the husband instead? See if your gut is right?
9D994E2B     //  I'll take a bar over a husband every day of the week.
13BB3758     //  Maldonado is in apartment 304.
1F827F3C     //  Why aren't we going in the front? No point being sneaky if we're just going to kick the door in.
D956FC7C     //  Dammit. We need to go round to the front.
434EE80F     //  Phelps, this could turn ugly. Forget about knocking. 
8B110E91     //  Let's take our boy by surprise.
C1B906B2     //  Hey, what the fuck?
A74CD0FB     //  LAPD, motherfucker. You're under arrest.
F14E3F4E     //  I got a hundred pounds on your wife, pal. It ain't gonna be so easy.
D77BD3C6     //  Now we ain't gonna have to explain no bruises to the DA.
D8599B82     //  Come quietly, Mr Maldonado.
08A29B4F     //  Come on, Angel. You don’t need to do this.
B137C99B     //  Damn... they got some decent shots in there.
B3075445     //  LAPD. You two are under arrest. 
2BAF40E7     //  Call for some back up, Finbarr.
56B1AE32     //  Your wife has been murdered, Angel.
13AF5423     //  Antonia?
40317E75     //  Oh God, no...
FEA70F5E     //  Where were you last night, Angel?
3D174FFD     //  I was here with my brother the whole night, goddammit! 
D1314021     //  You think I'd kill my own wife?
D63A22D1     //  Galloway, badge number five-six-four. 
0733E526     //  I need a prowl car at the apartment building, 330 North Hill Street. 
F5C6F506     //  Two suspects need transporting to Central.
CD5F1DF8     //  No more. I've had enough.
53D80C30     //  You can go to hell for all I care.
A8413548     //  Don't you walk away from me now, asshole!
564771E7     //  I've got nothing to say to you.
3DD8DF5A     //  You going to pay for that door, asshole?
72935FE4     //  We should give the whole place a going over, then talk to the neighbors.
56674484     //  And Phelps, I don't care that you just got smacked in the head, you don't call me Finbarr.
94474EDC     //  This will take some explaining.
BAC47041     //  The El Dorado.
760F7E5A     //  The El Dorado, must be a family favorite.
4D9F61F9     //  Just Picked Fruit Market. That's where Antonia went to call for a cab last night.
FC6B47A2     //  Just Picked Fruit Market.
68862E43     //  Just Picked Fruit Market. Suppliers to the El Dorado.
359E1236     //  I wonder if Angel gets all his groceries from this place.
B70324E6     //  Whaddaya want?
1D13BF27     //  LAPD. We are making some enquiries.
74629D30     //  Make it quick, I work nights.
6EC2DCB8     //  So you weren't home last night?
4DA7AC75     //  No, I was at work.
53821274     //  You know nothing about Mrs Maldonado fighting with her husband?
5ACD5695     //  Those two? They're always screaming the place down.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
96DB4061     //  Let me get back to sleep already!
1B1CE914     //  I know nothing more about their business.
98A5216D     //  You woke me up for that?
83C5B9DD     //  Hey, sorry about that. I'm playing with my kids.
AC6DA696     //  LAPD. Were you here last night?
F6E23136     //  Yeah. 
B22592EC     //  My wife and I are separated, and I had the kids last night. 
60A5B9BF     //  I put them to bed early and went to bed myself.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
F9EA7466     //  We're playing hide and seek, pal, so I kinda need to get back.
2601C3C6     //  Was that all you needed, Detective?
4A3C07E0     //  That's it? Suit yourself, pal.
B5DB939E     //  Hello?
F0E9A176     //  LAPD, ma'am. Did you hear a disturbance last night?
52A58CF4     //  Yes. Yes I did. 
645BD8B2     //  Mrs Maldonado lit out of here and her husband ran out after her.
3C08F5B4     //  You saw this, Miss...?
53FFBCB6     //  Aranda. I had the door open a crack.
43810FFB     //  Did you see Mr Maldonado come back inside after he ran out?
9C0B6F06     //  No, I didn't.
08D9CDF0     //  Thanks. We'll be in touch.
0D3E97E2     //  Go then. See if I care.
D21E653C     //  You'll have to excuse me now, Detectives, I'm going to a picture show.
61FFAAC1     //  Haven't we talked enough already?
DCCBB3F0     //  I kept thinking you were going to call that one a nosey old hag too, Phelps. Well executed restraint.
4B73FCD2     //  I’m executing restraint right now, Finbarr.
26BFA201     //  Give it up - there's nobody home. Let's keep moving.
80C0EB81     //  No good. Nobody here.
47B0A3E8     //  Car 11K. Car 11 King, come in.
7074C5EC     //  KGPL. 11 King, over.
B24292D5     //  11K, Captain Donelly and Detective Sergeant Finis Brown urgently request your presence at Central. A new letter has been found.
B63B38B7     //  11K, en route.
37B3EA65     //  Message from Captain Donelly, Detective. Your presence is requested urgently at Central Station. A new letter from the Dahlia killer has been found.
6EC91FB4     //  What can I say, Phelps? I like him for it.
006B45FE     //  You're like the neighborhood dog, Rusty. You like anything that rubs up against you.
A5D868AC     //  Yeah, and you like making things hard for yourself, hot shot. Try keeping this up for ten years.
27B31306     //  I’ll be Chief of Detectives in ten years.
96A6E8E6     //  Another letter? I thought the letter was from a nut.
76C0774A     //  These letters - Brown and Hansen believe they are genuine. From him.
015494C4     //  And now he's sent another.
D089E169     //  You know, I really hate this fuck. This Black Dahlia guy.
E992D35E     //   Have you seen the body? 
8F0ADE02     //  Fucking case just gnaws away at your guts. 
9F4F02C8     //  Hollywood... Every prom queen from every fucking hick town in America turns up here.
16133F89     //   Where do they end up? Gutted on the fucking sidewalk.
ED538D89     //  The Captain is waiting for you downstairs with Pinker.
BE252DA6     //  I don't have time for this, Detective.
87C15867     //  Let me get back to work, Detective.
A21E5C51     //  Was I finished?
B1CEC229     //  They’re waiting down in Tech Services, Phelps.
95E7F52A     //  We gonna go downstairs and see Donelly or what?
648CEABB     //  Boys - come on in.
80DFD7BF     //  Phelps, have you met Finis Brown?
E937F959     //  Pleased to meet you, sir.
FA30BD10     //  This information is confidential and doesn't leave this room.
7A4D6755     //  The new letter was left in the back seat of a cab.
D0EFC1FB     //   The driver thinks it was put through the window and not left by a customer.
17BFDF9D     //  We're checking all his fares back twenty four hours regardless.
61C1D6DD     //  Good.
25093119     //  Like the previous letters, it has been assembled from
B815FFE5     //  headlines and type from the Times and Examiner,
4875DEDA     //  then glued to an envelope.
AAEE330E     //  What is the other note?
75D87D14     //  This one, that's also new. A poem - hand typed.
C1025EC5     //  Do you mind if I take a look?
6E0FBF81     //  Go ahead. 
516FAE31     //  We've been over both documents pretty carefully. They've been wiped with gasoline so there's no chance of prints.
BD2AC298     //  That's the message from the Celine Henry case.
02E27BCE     //  Heap upon thy soul, by virtue of this curse...
7FC7CF9F     //  That's why we called you in.
5C7ECFB0     //  Do you think it's original?
0BB45AB2     //  Not unless he's a genius.
6D55670E     //  You like this nut job's poem?
24204C6E     //  No, I like Shelley. 
B6C3AA9E     //  It was written at least one hundred years ago.
6C247351     //  Shelley? Sure... I knew that.
A82EA96F     //  You see, Finis? I told you this lad was a bright boy.
07F41FD8     //  Sure, but what has it got to do with the case?
AA105738     //  'Prometheus Unbound'. 
D3FB054B     //  Prometheus was a Titan, a superhuman character who defied the gods to bring fire to humanity.
9075E395     //  The Dahlia guy believes he's superman?
D50C56EB     //  Your guess is as good as mine. 
0122A8FB     //  One thing for sure is that he is educated. 
A515DFF2     //  What about the link to the Henry case?
59D161B4     //  He could have got the wording from the papers. 
6E052B8F     //  As you said, he is fiendishly clever and takes pleasure in taunting us. 
475F21C8     //  What's happening with the Maldonado case?
A36A0265     //  We have the husband in custody. 
39E4C6A1     //  We haven't interviewed him yet.
2C5DDE66     //  Well upstairs then, lads, and see if we can break him.
FD9F4EDD     //  Can we discuss this later?
B9D09EF2     //  I have nothing more to say, Detective.
4ECAB60C     //  Keep me posted on your case. I need to get back to mine.
4E01FD3A     //  You need to get on with your case, but keep me updated.
74FEE813     //  Just a moment, Phelps. There's something else I'd like to discuss.
65D727AC     //  Your suspect is in Interview Two.
C81FE1A8     //  What the hell do you want from me now?
FF718BB4     //  Improved your attitude, Angel?
38B65B09     //  What do you want me to say? 
834D7C83     //  I was with Antonia the night she died, but she left the apartment. 
BC4AFE6E     //  That was the last time I saw her.
9BE253FA     //  So your wife paid you a visit last night. What time was that?
FEC4C610     //  Late. Around midnight, maybe? She didn't stay long.
E285AEA6     //  What time did she leave?
BB5CF619     //  Maybe one o'clock.
658484B0     //  So if you didn't kill your wife, who did? 
8BF72C9D     //  You better come up with something, Angel. 
797834C5     //  This doesn't look good.
AE45D356     //  Fuck you. I loved my wife.
1E86F2FD     //  You're good, kid. 
0D131F44     //  You murder your wife and you just sit there as cool as a cucumber.
6EE2D111     //  You're lying, Angel. You went after her. I think you killed her.
6DA3D8EB     //  You're out of your mind.
6C0B0442     //   My brother will tell you I was at home.
069C81B8     //  I loved my wife. I didn't kill her, and what you think doesn't mean shit.
7BF7242A     //  We have a witness who confirms that you were arguing, 
A9D295E4     //  that your wife ran out, that you followed her and didn't come back.
5C286109     //  I know this looks bad, but it's not true. 
07BDF701     //  We argued alright. 
7535CA20     //  But she went out and I went out after her, and 
4CB0CC9B     //  she jumped in a car on the corner...
CC20294D     //  There was a car waiting for her? Can you describe the driver?
D2AD34FF     //  Not the driver - it was too dark. 
A2A47993     //  But the car, it was a brown Ford coupe.
29532371     //  You and your wife weren't getting along. 
DF06D9EA     //  She was divorcing you. Is that why you killed her?
6DB5FBD0     //  We fought, yeah, but we weren't getting a divorce.
891E95DB     //  You deny killing your wife?
BCEB13F2     //  Of course I deny it. Why would I kill my woman?
788BE468     //  You didn't want anyone else to have her. 
183CF988     //  You didn't like the idea of other men fucking your wife. 
3DA6115E     //  Them slipping it to her... 
A18924BF     //  the idea that she might like it...
F5882CE7     //  Vete a tomar por culo!
FD53BB60     //  Easy there, Angel boy. Ease it back a notch.
936BC731     //  I don't believe you, Angel. She'd been granted a decree nisi. 
88FFB69A     //  She pushed you too far and you lashed out.
4436E88A     //  I told you - I wouldn't accept a divorce.
468C9F19     //  She was my wife. 
1C692ACB     //  Things got bad sometimes, but nothing would have made me want her dead. Nothing in the world.
53D3AF6D     //  The judge had set a date. You were going to be paraded in front of the whole city for your cruelty to her, Angel.
0F1D6502     //  Antonia... oh, Jesus.
27511375     //  She came in drunk. Out of her mind.
3B7592CB     //  She doesn't normally drink.
31A4C9B2     //  She was looking in her bag, said she
99EE4A02     //  wanted to serve me papers... her own husband.
F53F96F0     //  I slapped her down.
2B111A33     //  She screamed and ran out.
DD171300     //  And that's the truth.
32C7C374     //  What size shoe do you wear, Angel?
A59BBF92     //  Size eight. What difference does that make?
1A71591A     //  Your wife has been brutally murdered. 
92245275     //  So how do you explain your shirt being covered in blood?
78B915E0     //  You found that? I cut myself shaving.
DEEA0C36     //  We're typing the blood, Angel. It won't look good if it matches your wife.
F9D31E87     //  As God is my witness, I didn't kill her.
EEF0E28B     //  Angel, I'm not going to waste any more time on this. Give me something or I'm going to have you charged.
E00D222B     //  My brother, Hipolito - he said some bad things about Antonia last night. So I had to sock him one. We got into it.
06D8BC25     //  Keep talking.
C8EEDC4D     //  She said she came from the El Dorado Bar.
C777F0D0     //  And...
2FE399C4     //  It's not one of my places. 
9B555F1E     //  We used to buy fruit at the market down the street, 
23ECAFCC     //  but the creep there was always running his eyes all over my wife.
425BE46B     //  What's the name of this fruit market?
74F0C0D5     //  Just Picked Fruit. Ord Street, Downtown.
678AE257     //  You're lying through your teeth. You killed her and your brother is in on it.
1AB84659     //  You don't know what you're saying. 
AFDD12D6     //  Why would I do that?
FEB40CDC     //  Hipolito is my brother, but he would never lie for me about killing Antonia. 
9FD4337E     //  He knows he would go to hell for that.
2F2C676D     //  When we found your wife her jewelry had been removed. 
915F50E3     //  Was she wearing her religious medallion last night?
D4D9EA0C     //  Sure, she always wore that.
A939FB9E     //  What about the charm bracelet? Was she wearing that?
0BE67720     //  You know about that? She never wore it. 
A82A89B5     //  She didn't like the message. 
A9E4B444     //  She kept it locked up in that box of hers.
89956EC6     //  Looks like somebody broke into her room and stole her things there, too. Why'd you do it, Angel?
0EFBAD38     //  What the hell are you talking about? 
DBD02706     //  I was home with Hipolito.
675B797E     //  I think you killed her, stripped the body of jewelry, and then went back to her apartment for the bracelet.
6F307638     //  You should get a better hat. 
4D105920     //  The sun is getting to your head.
A76DB461     //  I've told you the truth - you don't believe me you can go to hell.
D264C80C     //  One last question, Angel. 
578F0119     //  Do the words 'Kiss the blood' mean anything to you?
E6884EA6     //  No. Sounds sick to me.
45B15C3E     //  You're not in the clear by any means, Angel. You're going back into a cell. You should think about whether you have anything else you need to share with us.
2380D637     //  Keep it to yourself, kid. 
F82E7EF7     //  Let it eat away at you like poison. 
51C1AF5B     //  You're going back into a cell. 
6FD7EBC6     //  We'll be waiting when you're ready to spill your guts.
14191D1A     //  Are you taking my wife's murder seriously?
21418BCC     //  Quit staring at me like that.
D01CE8B4     //  This is your crazy story. 
FA77DBF7     //  You can tell it yourself. 
3DDA5F93     //  I'm keeping my mouth shut from here out.
B0EF6627     //  What's your read on Maldonado?
F14F2286     //  I still like him for it. Seriously, that line about the guy at the fruit market making eyes at his woman? Please.
DAA5945C     //  You don't think it's The Werewolf? That Antonia is the Black Dahlia mark four?
C437A204     //  We'll get to the market and the guy behind the counter will tell us he saw Angel drag his old lady off into the night. This case will be shut like all the others.
595BDDF4     //  Just like all the others.
300E4D89     //  Angel's guilty. You don't need to be a poetry professor to figure it out.
9C4540C7     //  What can I get you?
EC3EA81A     //  LAPD. Detectives Phelps and Galloway.
D9C6B243     //  Diego Aguilar. How can I help?
4A634F2A     //  You work the bar last night?
3B87F627     //  Yeah, me and a temp guy from the agency.
BB0C11D8     //  Did you have a woman in here last night - twenty-one years old, Hispanic, drinking heavily?
551FB1B2     //  We have a lot of ladies like that in here, but yeah, I know who you mean. Antonia Maldonado. What'd she do?
62EC6843     //  She was murdered last night.
057762FF     //  Oh shit.
6B38D064     //  Do you know her well? Was she a regular?
FD00A1FC     //  Hell no.
A51818AF     //   But she was good and tight last night, complaining about her old man. 
6D4586EB     //  It's a story you get used to working in a bar. 
1B1531EE     //  She was so hammered last night she left a letter on the bar. 
1B08DE72     //  I'll show you.
AC4417DF     //  Divorce papers. Did you open them?
7EEFB09F     //  No need to.
E952D0CA     //   She was shouting about it and waving the letter around. Said she was going to show him.
3CBE4434     //  Can you remember what jewelry she was wearing?
7F599B95     //  She had a necklace - some kind of religious thing, I think. 
F1A05983     //  The temp guy would have more of an idea. 
825F2766     //  She took the beer he served her and cried into it all night.
E285AEA6     //  What time did she leave?
1017D019     //  Can't say for sure.
BCB1B6A6     //  Did she leave with anyone?
10ADBB83     //  No. 
BA8AAE56     //  She wanted a cab, but my payphone ain't working so I couldn't call her one.
85044EA8     //  Where did she go? 
DAC71866     //  Give me something or the LAPD will start getting interested in this place.
414A9A82     //  Take it easy. She wanted a cab, okay? 
2DB63A13     //  My phone was out of order. 
2DBCADE9     //  The closest one I knew was at the fruit market across the street, so I suggested she try there. 
43322EB6     //  She seemed reluctant.
56BB7469     //  That's a lie. She left well before closing. 
7FD359F2     //  You fed her booze and took her home yourself.
5E3CC5DA     //  Whoa, hold up. Look, I run a bar, okay? 
02902249     //  I don't know what you're getting mad at me for.
32C0CF44     //  No call to point the finger like that. 
20FC446C     //  I'm being cooperative - a good citizen - how about cutting me some slack?
BF44B7B5     //  Did Antonia say where she was going when she left?
F0D4EFA5     //  She said she was going to serve the papers on the husband. 
061E7A2E     //  Said that would take the smile off his face. 
99E0372D     //  If you ask me, she was scared and the drink was for Dutch courage.
A8E0A2E1     //  She attract any interest?
5F19206B     //  An extremely drunk young woman? 
C546A17A     //  What do you think? 
09B89B31     //  She managed to scare them off, though.
5A0F86F4     //  So you let a twenty one year old girl who was stone drunk just walk off into the night?
5C6CE09E     //  I'm sorry about what happened - I really am - but I pour drinks.
C0626BB9     //   I don't claim to have the answers to everyone's problems.
0910638E     //  I think she met someone here. Someone who followed her. You're protecting someone.
F04277AF     //  I swear on my mother's soul that if I had any idea who was involved in this, 
DD23147C     //  I would tell you.
256EEF9A     //  You have a tough job - no one is saying otherwise - but you don't have any right to take it out on me.
12F5C0D1     //  Thanks, you've been a big help.
A06322D6     //  No problem. 
BA405C00     //  Hey... get the guy, will ya?
8D7D5510     //  We'll do our best. 
5F12DF18     //  One last question - what size shoe do you take, Mr Aguilar?
D70DFB77     //  A broad nine. I have wide feet.
0A8C2807     //  Why are you stalling us, Aguilar? You're making yourself a suspect.
BF65738C     //  All I tried to do was help, and you come in here, into my bar, and you start asking me these quest...
F56089B8     //  What's your shoe size?
655E73F7     //  What? I take a broad nine. Wide feet.
314C7399     //  Just Picked Fruit Market. 
6C684FF0     //  How many slices of lemon does this place go through?
A5E1C7C1     //  Business is booming at the Just Picked Fruit Market. They're delivering all over the city.
E1EA565B     //  Sir, do you work here?
2ECC795C     //  Sorry, pal. Just making deliveries.
89F22A34     //  From where?
3256F381     //  Just Picked Fruit Market, across the street.
86CBCF7E     //  A fruit market delivers here?
86B74D2F     //  Yeah, sure does. The Mexes love a little slice with their tequila.
86B74D2F     //  Yeah, sure does. The Mexes love a little slice with their tequila.
4491439D     //  Fine. Thanks.
CD6E3DA9     //  We found a crate a lot like the ones you're wheeling there, except it was filled with booze. You know anything about that?
6B041FF6     //  What? No. 
243C1E99     //  We deliver all over the place, Officer - no telling where the boxes end up. 
CBA88230     //  Excuse me, I have to get on with this.
4491439D     //  Fine. Thanks.
8F4FC69C     //  You mind if I get on with this, buddy?
C9018F2E     //  'Scuse me.
26155A6E     //  Okay. I'll go then, if we're done.
A7BD93A0     //  That all you need from me?
3372E505     //  Excuse me would you, Detectives?
BF364ADF     //  Do you mind if I get back to my bar?
C0A25F85     //  You waiting for someone?
87816DDF     //  I was all set to help you boys out, but now I think you ought to leave.
5DF1D5D1     //  You think there's anything to the divorce angle?
6BCCE97F     //  I've been through three, Phelps. They're no big deal. After a while you just numb yourself to the experience.
0A13D920     //  But Angel, he's a young Latino man. It would hurt his sense of who he is. He'd see himself as a failure - a woman taking control over his life.
CF0A1FAE     //  Then she fronts him and he snaps. Works for me. That makes Angel a killer as well as a piece of shit.
F94D3E2F     //  Shut. Great. We'll need to come back later, Phelps. 
2093B438     //  Maybe somebody here saw Antonia the night she died.
27EFC21F     //  The handbag was left just up there. 
DCBF0FF2     //  Overlooking the market.
51C59621     //  We could have come here from the start and saved ourselves a day's legwork.
33AC9DE9     //  Sir, I'm... wait. You look familiar.
71A0BD6A     //  Hey... from the bar, right? What brings you here?
D2B6DE87     //  LAPD. Detective Phelps and Galloway.
236D2371     //  Clem Feeney. What can I do for you?
452F8A83     //  Did you happen to see a young woman last night, twenty-one years old, Hispanic?
85543411     //  Sure, she came by last night. Why do you ask?
EB21F96C     //  The young lady arrived around midnight?
C0E4FB21     //  Yeah, something like that. Used the phone for a cab and then left.
1CE15405     //  She look like she was having a good night to you?
D2650538     //  Hard to tell. 
6182FDD9     //  It might just have been the booze that was making her seem maudlin.
A5103678     //  You already knew Mrs Maldonado, didn't you, Clem?
BF185CC8     //  Sure, I'd met her before. She seemed like a nice lady. 
A82C5E08     //  Her husband went apeshit one day when he caught me talking to her. 
5020F44A     //  She hadn't been back until last night.
5C80B197     //  She was brutally beaten soon after she left the bar. 
0CF312D3     //  Clem, you sure you didn't drive her somewhere?
F62FDF81     //  What you are suggesting?
3B747563     //  I run an honest establishment and I'm trying to be helpful. 
70CB66A5     //  Do I deserve this kind of treatment?
025E6359     //  Where did she go from here?
D9A30FD7     //  She wanted a cab, but I couldn't get her one. 
12422A2E     //  I was about to offer to drive her, but a car pulled up and she got into that.
9D81E936     //  Can you describe the car?
FD0E36E6     //  A brown Ford coupe, I think. 
E918B3E3     //  She seemed to know the guy.
302FC408     //  Something bad happened to her, Clem, and so far we have her husband as a suspect, and you. 
3B52FC91     //  Give us something that will make us go away.
BB615012     //  Me? You think it was me? 
DF420C47     //  Do I look like a violent man?
028317C0     //  I think she came in here to call a cab. 
A18F257A     //  Even though she was drunk she was reluctant to do it. 
4B213963     //  She just wanted the phone, and you had to push it further.
263FB8A4     //  What are you talking about? 
C55D8EE0     //  How can you make up these lies about me?
3174D860     //  I think you should go now.
4D8DCB68     //  She was wearing a necklace?
47BB0652     //  I didn't notice.
F282E360     //  What about a charm bracelet?
AD79F3F3     //  No, can't say I noticed that.
C97A8E8A     //  You weren't paying attention, Feeney?
FB8CF034     //  Hey, you're getting the wrong idea.
5E65AF70     //  Exactly how much fruit do you sell here after midnight, Clem?
120C2A57     //  Ah... look, not much.
464233C2     //  I sell the odd bottle on the side,
CDBFE591     //  to the after hours crowd.
22622911     //  I don't want any trouble. I'm just
7DF4A224     //  trying to make a buck.
1FE2444F     //  We recovered some of Mrs Maldonado's personal items from this area, Clem. The last item we found overlooked this place. I think you're lying and if you want our help, you'd better come clean with us.
636E6C93     //  You think I'm some kind of nut job - that I did something to her. Me. What proof have you got?
26CA3722     //  I have a store to run if you're quite finished.
72C52E6C     //  Do you mind if we look around?
D486825B     //  Why would you want to do that?
F05C6802     //  Because we say so.
79800777     //  I guess you can. 
E849DCBA     //  Don't you have to get a court order or something? 
9A127088     //  I have rights...
946CCEB2     //  Clem - shhh.
7754AFF5     //  Nice knowing you, Detective.
5851178D     //  Do you mind? I gotta get back to my fruit store.
8F853087     //  Hey, I answered your questions, okay?
3765ABD1     //  Hey, maybe you got time to stand around, copper. 
A363FF75     //   I don't.
43C844FB     //  Cooperating didn't get me anywhere with you people. 
D2ADF94B     //  Time to try keeping my mouth shut.
77897809     //  You see that stuff? This is our guy. Let's get him.
0141F79A     //  Hold on a second. If he hasn't run yet, we've got time to check the evidence.
8F429BB9     //  No wonder he stays open late at night.
F259AC07     //  People have to get their vitamins.
492B895E     //  So what are we hiding in here?
2846C690     //  This thing needs a combination.
D78FD438     //  Holy cross.
08FEC34B     //  Praying hands.
76A64429     //  Mother of God.
0EF2B916     //  Blunt force trauma to the base of the skull.
29856027     //  This fruit stall punk gets about ten seconds to explain before I pull his fucking arms off.
6DCCD1E0     //  Why cut someone who is already dead?
641509C7     //  It's a typical power thing. 
23461336     //  Once the stiff is dead, the creep usually feels they can do whatever they like. 
616E9560     //  You must have seen it during the war.
D4044108     //  Wrap it up, Phelps. Only so long he's going to leave us in here with his souvenirs.
F81B923F     //  Clem?
F314F66A     //  You’re a sick man, Clem. You need help.
0E2C6FCC     //  Forget the other broads. Right now we have clear orders. Let's get back out to the crime scene.
BEB80FB7     //  What's the big rush? We need to get back to the scene and do things properly.

C433AFBB     //  Hey. Buddy. Trying to work here. Got me?
1A2D7932     //  You want nice, pretty pictures for your case report? Sure you do. So leave me alone.
BFF8ACB4     //  Similar MO.
9E9C5040     //  To what? The Dahlia? I don't think so.
5DF02638     //  Celine Henry.
6213E012     //  That's a closed case. This is probably another sad sack who lost his temper with a broad who wouldn't put out.
A1356742     //  Are you a suspect, Rusty?
73F441A4     //  Watch your mouth, Phelps. All I'm saying is we got enough to do without reopening closed cases.
A83B86EC     //  Talk me through it, Mal.
BC521411     //  Severely battered, on display. 
4987BA44     //  Footprints would indicate that she has been stomped. 
1AA959C0     //  Size of the footprints would seem to indicate a smallish men's shoe. 
15A4155B     //  What size shoe did Mendez wear?
B49060AC     //  You finished?
FF90CAE5     //  No, I'm not. At a glance I would say strangulation was the cause of death. I'll need to do further tests for semen.
D986BBAD     //  Angry boyfriend. If they were married they'd be at home, not humping out here in lover's lane.
32CE070D     //  Do you mind if I examine the body?
5B5672D4     //  Be my guest.
206FD1EB     //  The ligature mark is very...
9FC1B6DD     //  Distinctive. 
46064928     //  I'll do some comparisons back at the lab and get back to you.
BF7C87E1     //  Looks like she was tied up.
D2D9374C     //  It does at first, but that would leave a mark on her other wrist too. I think her watch might have been torn off.
9DBF9662     //  What's this mark? The cut on the finger?
17F78299     //  Fourth finger, left hand. A wedding or engagement ring. Violently removed.
AC4AAB10     //  Well, we have a name. Can you run Deidre Moller by R&I?
F089AB65     //  Back in a second.
9FA83DA3     //  Officer Gonzales, badge nine-ninety- four.
8A7F22C9     //  What do you need, Officer?
5884FDD3     //  Victim a white female Jane Doe on Hill Street. Possible ID of Deidre Moller. Can you run through the name and give me the details?
0368F7FD     //  One moment... Deidre Moller. Currently resides 130 North Bonnie Brae Street. Reported missing early this morning.
F103DE75     //  Reported by who?
4C129E28     //  Checking... by her husband. Mr Hugo Moller. Says here we've had a couple of violence complaints from that address. Incident reports but no charges laid.
0879E9C8     //  Thanks very much for your help.
5022326D     //  If the motive was robbery, why not take the money?
E3986DCB     //  The stomping angle in the Henry case - was it reported in the press?
F2081279     //  Sure was. Every detail a copycat would want was there in the story.
224C10F3     //  I need to get back to it, Phelps.
FD9F4EDD     //  Can we discuss this later?
5D8141E4     //  One more sweep and I'm headed back to the lab. You've got all you need here, Phelps.
F9EB4070     //  Give me some peace and quiet while I finish up.
7A0867CE     //  Detectives? R&I says a Deidre Moller of 130 North Bonnie Brae was reported missing this morning by her husband, Hugo Moller.
8E111CDF     //  What'd I tell you?
C5034120     //  You said it would be the boyfriend. Does she look like a teenager to you?
49C3814B     //  Let's grab the husband, take him Downtown and work him over. We could have this wrapped up by lunchtime.
96C644B4     //  What about not making assumptions and going on the evidence?
3E38BA47     //  Phelps and Galloway, LAPD. 
8F474733     //  Is your father home?
1109D9DE     //  He'll be home soon. 
8442E213     //  He's been out looking for Mommy.
B8217F90     //  What's your name, Miss?
187EBB4B     //  Michelle Elouise Moller.
7A446AEC     //  Can we come in?
9C55E77F     //  I suppose so.
418785C7     //  Won't you... won't you come in?
AF8719D0     //  Thank you.
2C90B236     //  Could you have a seat for me, Michelle?
A8D6479D     //  We're going to have a look around.
28C4F38E     //  Work boots. Size eights.
72BBE905     //  Elgin wrist watch. Probably the same one snatched from her body.
D32554C0     //  No sign of a wedding ring.
8975DCB7     //  So what happened to the Chevy coupe?
B74833B4     //  Is this about Mommy? Daddy is trying to find her. Please tell me she's okay...
3FF83F3F     //  I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Michelle, 
B7826690     //  but your mother is dead.
DCFB4D7C     //  Do you think you could answer a few questions for us?
4B751176     //  I could try.
4CD8B5E8     //  When did you last see your mother?
C6FA2C93     //  Yesterday afternoon. 
785F98ED     //  I went to a dance at Belmont High. 
A1CBD120     //  Mommy was supposed to pick me up but she didn't show.
30F357AE     //  So what did you do then?
0073C71C     //  I was upset. Daddy came instead.
76B9A85D     //  And did he come and get you?
BAA4D1E0     //  Of course. 
04F80A9C     //  Some boys offered me a ride home, but that's not the right thing to do.
2E5A06F8     //  So you were hanging around the school for quite a while? What happened with your father?
14DED5EA     //  I don't know. 
B911193E     //  I called and called and finally he answered. 
46184EF6     //  He came straight away then.
F6C21D9C     //  You're feeling guilty about this, Michelle. 
09D42680     //  What were you up to that you missed your mother?
81619212     //  You're crazy. 
83C8C0DD     //  I was waiting out front, exactly where she asked me to be. 
0A0243C1     //  Ask my teacher if it isn't so.
CE8E66A8     //  You're rotten. 
BAD0CAAA     //  I feel terrible already about my Mom and you're trying 
273A7AEE     //  to make me feel worse.
5D9A542D     //  Some of your mother's jewelry was missing. Can you describe her things?
EFA0A64F     //  A ring, a watch... 
11FA2FF0     //  I never paid much attention to that stuff.
778ADF80     //  I know it's painful, Michelle, but this may be important. She wore a wedding ring?
01209725     //  Mommy chose it herself. A rose gold wedding band and a matching diamond and ruby engagement ring.
32C22DF1     //  She wore a watch?
0BF77B40     //  Yes. A yellow gold Elgin watch. Daddy bought it for her birthday. They had a fight. It was kind of a make-up present.
703987D5     //  You seem reluctant to talk about her jewelry.
5743DEA9     //  It's a touchy subject with Daddy. 
39284685     //  He thought she wasted too much money on her appearance.
E57C0AE9     //  Why don't you tell the truth, Michelle? Something really bugs you about your mother's jewelry.
1CE37B81     //  You really are horrible, you know that? What makes you think that?
F01A84ED     //  My mother spent all her time fussing over herself. There wasn't much time left for me and Daddy.
6CCF2122     //  Your mom and dad are happily married?
038A5EFF     //  What are you saying? Of course they are.
4AEF4C3E     //  Your mom and dad never got angry with each other? They were happy?
E2027B73     //  Well... not like the movies. Not like you read about in books.
03BA4FF1     //  They weren't happy, were they, Michelle? Did your father ever hit your mother?
1A77FB1E     //  Just the once. 
4D69E74D     //  She said she would leave him if he ever did it again. 
EC3CB6B4     //  He bought her a brooch pin to make up for it. 
2C5F3E83     //  Mommy always wore her Golden Butterfly.
49750FD4     //  I think your father was violent with your mother. I think they weren't very happy and you should tell me, young lady.
4F22476F     //  You may be the police but you have no right to talk about my Mom and Dad like that.
C5397990     //  When my dad gets home I'm going to ask him to punch you on the nose, mister.
456B008C     //  Thanks, Miss Moller. You have been very brave.
3566A254     //  I know this is a tough time for you, Michelle, but you really should try and help the police.
E9EA452B     //  Wait, perhaps there's more I can tell you...
F561791E     //  I want to think about my mother, not you. Go away.
DE5A8576     //  Shouldn't I have somebody here while I'm talking to you?
14756382     //  I won't say anything more to you. I don't want to get Daddy into trouble.
A92FD7A4     //  I can't talk. There are things I need to do if I'm... if I have to go away for a while.
6AD561A4     //  Daddy should be on his way.
6B4F9921     //  I always thought policemen were meant to be kind and helpful. Not any more. I won't say another word.
E5605C0C     //  Hey! What gives?
1958C645     //  Daddy, the police are here.
430811D6     //  Go to your room please, Michelle.
665F7448     //  Daddy, Mommy is gone and...
7B91E176     //  Go to your room, young lady!
127A164C     //  She's not even out of school. You can't come in here, interrogating her like she's some kind of...
210BC9A4     //  Your wife was found murdered this morning.
D3A8443B     //  Found? 
18E4EAB3     //  What? 
37EACDDD     //  But she only...
15C1C1AD     //  We have some questions that we would like to ask you.
6726DB45     //  Sure, yeah... yeah, I'll do my best.
9B5B7437     //  You phoned in a missing persons report this morning?
BD722C0B     //  Yeah, that's right. My wife didn't come home last night. She left around... 
B8CC36B9     //  She left around 9.30. 
A26C6202     //  Michelle was at a dance. She called me to let me know that Deidre didn't turn up.
9DA58ECE     //  Was your wife unreliable?
A5C1F573     //  No.
A0E860C1     //  Did your wife ever go out by herself? To bars? Nightclubs?
10ADBB83     //  No. 
69DEED2A     //  What are you suggesting? 
9FF858F1     //  You suggesting my wife's loose? 
45FE17EE     //  Now is not the time for you to be pushing me, mister.
B80AEA40     //  Your daughter said you were having an argument?
CFDC3D4E     //  We argued about who would pick up Michelle. 
F6495935     //  I worked a full day. 
4C2C643B     //  I wanted to come home, put my feet up.
CC27137C     //  And you didn't report that she was missing till this morning? 
1422B3CD     //  That's very unusual, Mr Moller, not to mention suspicious.
44CF18F8     //  Look, I... I was annoyed with her. 
A91F9B8F     //  That's why I was waiting for her to come home. Why, are you telling me something different?
82586381     //  You'd better think about leaving or you are going to have some trouble on your hands.
ADB7F7CD     //  So you were here all night? 
055AEE30     //  You stayed in while your wife went out to pick up your daughter?
1FD87E28     //  Yes, that's correct.
A9B49696     //  You didn't go anywhere?
C246E9C0     //  No. I was here the whole time.
28741EDF     //  You got any way of confirming this story of yours?
179FDF24     //  You son of a bitch. 
C634BFC8     //  You come here making all these accusations...
DAAFCF42     //  You should come clean if you're having an affair, or if there's something going on.
46D5D35C     //  I told you I was here. What, are you saying I wasn't?
84E67647     //  Calling me a liar on the day I lose my wife.
2705B27F     //  So why did you take so long to answer the phone when your daughter called?
05CA5417     //  Okay, I went out for a while. I was driving around. It's my way of relaxing.
2FD0751D     //  Your wife was beaten and then strangled. In your case you have no alibi and a history of violence towards your wife.
773D97FF     //  That's not... that's not true, goddamnit!
4370878D     //  Well, give me an alternative, Hugo. 
291C4C6E     //  Give me a reason why I shouldn't take you in for this.
3A563C6A     //  My wife and I fought no more than any married couple. 
22F0082D     //  Sometimes it got rough. 
D4A15E9A     //  It was usually about money, okay. I... 
ED5D4BE2     //  I'm tight. That... that's not a crime.
80D440A4     //  I think you set this up, Hugo. 
8747463A     //  I think you kicked up a fuss about staying home 
E99CD24F     //  for an alibi, 
625F8C21     //  then you followed your wife and murdered her.
3A95B0F0     //  You're out of your mind, coming in here making accusations like that! 
05245664     //  Come out into the yard and I'll make you take that back, mister.
DAC7960D     //  It is true, Hugo. You're a violent man. 
DEC6DB0A     //  You tried to keep a lid on it at home, but sometimes you lost control. 
D35BE13A     //  Your daughter and your wife were scared of you.
D54BD85B     //  You don't know anything about me.
5FBD7D3C     //  I'm not a killer. No matter what you think.
4B22A90E     //  I know about the Golden Butterfly, Hugo, and how you bought your wife off the last time you hurt her.
E71D1BE7     //  She liked to spend money, alright? 
FD0E7C0F     //  Dresses, jewelry, her hair. It drove me goddamn crazy. 
2BB3331B     //  Do I look like a Rockefeller?
1166A4CA     //  Nobody likes a cheapskate, Hugo.
AB0A52E9     //  Your wife went to pick up Michelle?
B311B580     //  Yes, that's right.
54E13D02     //  Where is the school?
7F459E17     //  Belmont High on West Second Street. There's a parking lot next door where the parents wait for the kids.
F47B89C1     //  What happened, Hugo? You got any theories? Because we're starting to like you for this.
3A8628BC     //  The car park by the school is kind of dark. 
B4C8AEE0     //  Maybe somebody jumped her there. 
1CDC6CB5     //  Did you try the parking lot?
91858C4F     //  I think you went with her but you didn't go to the school. What really happened, Moller?
243D5599     //  You're making this stuff up and I'll dare anyone 
8FEAD55D     //  to prove any different.
FD06DB44     //  Damn you. 
FB7CD033     //  I don't even get a chance to grieve and you go and start pointing the finger at me. You can go to hell
94CB4327     //  What size shoe do you wear, Mr Moller?
E8C068A8     //  Why do you ask?
61886883     //  It's routine, sir. Simple process of elimination.
844ED5BD     //  Nines, I think.
289F1831     //  You always wear size nines?
3EB1356C     //  Sometimes tens. 
8213CCDA     //  Depends on the brand. 
75EA6EF7     //  Foreign shoes have different sizes.
C6509D48     //  You know anyone who wears a smallish men's shoe who had a major grudge against your wife? Is there something you would like to tell us, Hugo?
C008FDD4     //  No, I do not. 
C67AB3CA     //  You finished making hints?
2A74655E     //  Why are you lying to me, Mr Moller?
9026E0CC     //  Why would I lie to you at a time like this?
393A746F     //  My shoe size? You must really be running on empty.
5248E0D6     //  That's funny - the work boots we found here are size eights. Why lie about it if you've got nothing to hide?
EDB4F8AB     //  Because I always get teased about the size of my feet. You know, small feet, small...
FB12CBB2     //  Always been true in my experience.
93E834A2     //  Getting hostile with us is a very bad idea, Hugo.
86776EAA     //  I'm no murderer.
3EF438EB     //  Make some arrangements for your daughter and then 
77060C2D     //  present yourself to Central Station for questioning.
F6E4C5E9     //  You gotta be kidding me, Phelps! Put the cuffs on him!
424D99EE     //  This is an outrage. I didn't kill my wife.
D4B39A90     //  Your daughter is in the next room, Moller, 
73169645     //  so I'm giving you a break. 
C53CA249     //  Don't make me change my mind. 
B38E6544     //  And don't make me come looking for you.
1D22D668     //  That's it? There's got to be more.
E46F678E     //  Look, please... I need some time with this. Maybe you should just go.
42ED94F2     //  Get out there and find whoever did this to my wife, Detective.
C30CAC26     //  Please, if that's all, please just leave.
9931ECAC     //  You can't bully me like you did my daughter. 
30ABF958     //  We're done talking. 
9FA2190D     //  Get out of my goddamn house.
06763E5E     //  We should go back in there and bust his ass.
8AD59F98     //  One, we need to break his alibi. 
26EA215E     //  Check phone records, canvass the neighbors. 
231FBFC9     //  Two, we have motive of domestic violence, which 
A3FDBEF2     //  probably goes for half the men in LA. 
9E323412     //  Three, we have no evidence tying him to the crime scene.
FD1DA914     //  Hello, Detective!
B1D10CD6     //  Yes, ma'am?
11B50AB7     //  I heard the terrible news over the radio.
6C98F651     //  And you can help us with our inquiries?
749DE7F6     //  Yes, sir. They had a row last night. 
CCB26B5B     //  I heard Mrs Moller screaming.
D903590F     //  Did you see Mrs Moller come home late last night at all?
4A98B36B     //  No, not at all. 
EDCBC33F     //  I did see Mr Moller put something in the incinerator earlier this morning, though.
2C140879     //  I told you he was our guy. Now let's get this bum Downtown and into a cell.
D2C3DCD2     //  Look! There he is now!
385FFB0E     //  Hey! Step back from there!
21971076     //  Don't let him get away!
8767C59B     //  Okay, but no shooting. We need this 
59D5D422     //  guy to make the case!
E737FB58     //  Enough running, Hugo! Hands where we can see them!
C14D76F4     //  Wait. I've got something else to tell you, Officer.
29C67326     //  Best I don't say anything more.
C231FD93     //  I don't want to get caught in the middle of all this.
D21EB06C     //  Check in the incinerator, Phelps. I'll hold our stupid friend here.
E9A9DB38     //  This doesn't look good, Hugo.
3AF5D124     //  Hugo Moller - we are arresting you on suspicion of murdering your wife.
71AA9700     //  I can explain the blood.
C3AAFF5D     //  Get him booked in at Central, Officer. 
27389A50     //  Then put him in an interview room - we'll be speaking with him later. And inform the Captain.
8C15C3BD     //  Yes sir, Detective.
7163888A     //  Call it in, Rusty.
BEBCA72A     //  Galloway. Homicide Division, badge number five-six-four.
7F1B30C6     //  Go ahead, Detective unit.
9136CF9B     //  Can we get Ray Pinker and a Technical Services team to a house at 130 North Bonnie Brae Street? And send someone down from Juvenile Hall to look after a young lady.
78C1B7C2     //  Roger, 11K.
3AE86C92     //  Inform Detective Phelps that the coroner has a report waiting. Police Morgue, Downtown, when he's available.
38C4D299     //  Got it, KGPL.
F2BF2436     //  Is there someone you can call, Miss?
43A11A29     //  I don't... no one's home and...
BD430243     //  You need somewhere to stay, Michelle. Do you have other family? Grandparents? Aunts or uncles?
0D0C0CAE     //  I could call Aunt Helen. But she lives in Bakersfield and...
95A75A1B     //  Call her. 
5022BFAC     //  We're going to get someone down here from Juvenile Hall to talk to you in the meantime.
1BA166EE     //  I need an address on a Belmont High School.
4A21519E     //  Checking for you, Detective... Belmont High, 1575 West Second Street.
8B09A905     //  Any messages for me?
4D670A41     //  One, Detective. From the coroner. Report to the police morgue, Downtown, as soon as possible. He has your autopsy report.

FA74F29A     //  Always make the husband, Phelps. 
B8E9948E     //  Nine times out of ten it's the closest person to the vic who does the deed. 
C3FC4DB8     //  God knows I've wanted to kill some wives in my day.

C3F372FB     //  What?
A283EDC7     //  The law of parsimony. 
2E13E93F     //  Occam's razor. 
FC83BD37     //  The simplest explanation is most likely the correct one.
8C03DA20     //  You know, you could have said that without getting all liturgical on me.
90E461E7     //  I'll try to dumb things down from now on.
CB051383     //  Appreciated. And try this one on for size: Rusty's razor.
0F16FD24     //  How's that go?
E19A7226     //  You blame the guy that's bangin' her.
407CCD80     //  Ah, of course. The famous lex ignoramus.
D2AC0A02     //  It closes cases, Cole. Puts a lot of people away, that one.
4D7A2AEA     //  Phelps, Rusty. Thanks for coming.
086F4B92     //  Can you blood type the shoes that we bagged and see if they are a match?
D17E35B4     //  Sure. It'll all be in the report, but I'm assuming you want the details now?
9F5FDBFF     //  Please. Cause of death is strangulation?
FBA4D27C     //  Correct. Take a look at the samples on the bench.
F56C1FC8     //  Using a plaited rope. A plaited braid, to be technical. Pinker says it left the burr laceration on her neck.
2429CB21     //  What are the normal uses for that kind of rope?
023C605B     //  On boats, mooring lines...
8C906434     //  Correct. Although Ray says that they're sometimes used as bell ropes in churches.
6645F2EB     //  So are we looking for a sailor or a minister?
E5442F35     //  Well, in my experience sailors seem to have the greater libido.

3809F975     //  No external or internal traces of semen.
CB9FC555     //  The shoe prints?
ADA59F17     //  Size eights. Very similar to the impressions from the Henry case.
C3382565     //  Now, who do we remember got caught with bloody size eights? I think we have our bird.

A54EE064     //  I like 'em a little younger than that.
7DAF7A30     //  Turn out your pockets, Eli.

DBBD034B     //  Who protects the children, Eli?

EA47F5FF     //  Where did you find the brooch, Eli?
AFAE4827     //  In the parking lot.

1A13FE19     //  You thinking about the little ones too?
C93F76FF     //  I shouldn't really be talking to you, mister.
AA41102A     //  Can you leave me alone, please? You're making me feel uncomfortable.
E15BC2A6     //  I can't talk. Sorry, I just can't.
F213A30D     //  Are you really a policeman, mister? You're kind of cute for a cop.
70DAEF37     //  Let's check for evidence in the car.
426223EC     //  The overalls are stenciled 'HM'. Moller is a mechanic.
B99FF0F5     //  I wonder what Eli does for a living.
2AA6EB08     //  Blood and skin samples. We better get Ray Pinker out here.
2E0B44A5     //  This looks consistent with the injuries.

4C2774EB     //  I say we make Rooney for this. 
710E8949     //  I think we should lay it on him. 
D28F5F70     //  He was near the car, he had her jewelry. 
8DDCC44A     //  The DA will love him for it.
094A0DEC     //  Even if he didn't do it?
DD292BF4     //  Who cares whether he did it? You have kids, Phelps? 
E12F7B18     //  He needs to be taken permanently out of harm's way.
045B9A3A     //  And we let Moller slide?
700E06BB     //  For a while. He gets a free pass for now.
2B750B99     //  I need interrogations set up at Central for both suspects being held in the Moller homicide case.

64570C95     //  Moller is in Two, and the pervert is in One. Get in there and get a conviction.

AE0BB49C     //  Here's where we stand, Hugo. 
E2DA829B     //  Your next door neighbor heard screaming coming from your house. 
08CCA359     //  You were burning your bloodstained shoes. 
FD0CCF2C     //  You have no one who can confirm your whereabouts last night. 
6C56CC26     //  Your daughter says you are a violent man. 
6DC9C665     //  We have everything we need to send you to Death Row, 
5F898D2E     //  and all you have to say for yourself is "I didn't do it".
88D76BEA     //  I swear I didn't kill her. Give me that lie test - I can prove it.
A8D9D373     //  Why did you burn your shoes, Hugo?
D8D00319     //  Because I knew you'd never believe me.
4CAEBA5B     //  Believe what?
AB847B84     //  It's rabbit's blood. A guy at work brought some in and I helped him skin them.
369D5C3B     //  Are you going to tell me what I want to know, or do we have to take it out of you in lumps?
F9CEBA90     //  Give it your best shot. 
54C94F7E     //  I can take whatever you're throwing.
FE655CFE     //  You're full of shit, Hugo. 
12012DFC     //  You want us to feel sorry for you? 
20D450CC     //  We feel sorry for your wife. 
B21475A3     //  The blood came from the wound in your wife's head.
7CA203C9     //  Why would I lie? You can check at the workshop.
D7045B03     //  You don't want to catch the real guy. You just want to blame me.
15E569BB     //  We found your wife's car. Someone parked it at the school late last night. Do you have anything to say about that?
FFB32430     //  It wasn't me.
50B0223F     //  What were you wearing when you got home from work last night?
C53834F0     //  I keep them at work in my locker.
FFEDAA8F     //  What color are your overalls?
8ECA2160     //  Green. We all wear green. It's our company policy.
58C3943A     //  It was you, Hugo. 
AD735523     //  I'm offering you a chance to come clean on this.
3449D195     //  For the last time, I did not kill my wife.

DDAA024B     //  My overalls are in the laundry of my house.
93034DD0     //  Either you start backing up what you're saying, or I'm gonna walk out that door.
99C40FB0     //  Green overalls, bloodstained, with the initials 'HM', found in the trunk of your wife's car.
EDAF5A68     //  They can't be mine.
C736F1C0     //  Why, Hugo? 
0990F91D     //  Because if they were yours, they'd be in the incinerator too?
90929B69     //  Do you know anything about ropes, Hugo?
F3629BB3     //  As much as the next man. I was a Scout. I learned some more in the Army.
3EEF6CB3     //  Do you know anything about braided ropes?
76850797     //  Some. 
2AFB6F5E     //  They're mainly used for mooring lines, hawsers, that kind of stuff. 
5B5E8CCF     //  We don't have much use for them in the machine shop. We use chain hoists.
0C6872BE     //  For argument's sake. What type of rope would you use?
FDB32485     //  If I had to, I would use a triple braid. Less flex. Easier to control.
03BE1643     //  You learned to strangle with a rope in the Army?
B0B9AFB4     //  With rope, with my bare hands, but mainly with wire. I learned a lot of things in the Army but I... I still didn't kill my wife.
33F0C480     //  Your wife was strangled with a braided rope, which we found in the trunk of her car. I think you bought that rope specifically to strangle her.
C4797687     //  You can think whatever you want, but that rope has nothing to do with me.
248E185B     //  My wife is the victim here, 
079EF355     //  but so am I. 
B0381D1C     //  What am I going to do without her? 
DEAFCB0B     //  And you... 
D05242E6     //  you heartless bastard.
B769EB6A     //  Your wife was beaten with a tire iron, Hugo. An appropriate choice of tool for a mechanic.
BC6B2BA6     //  I know nothing about any tire iron.
A70DE8A4     //  So someone mugged her and then took to her with their tire iron?
EA0962AF     //  Please, we... I don't want to think about it.
006542FE     //  You're going to die for this, Moller. You better give me something if I'm going to believe your story.
C0B68B37     //  My conscience is clear. You can't badger me into admitting anything.
94F21FEE     //  You're lying, Hugo. You're gonna have to come clean on this.
443628FD     //  You got no proof.
82FB1F11     //  Your wife drove a Chevrolet, Hugo. What make of car do you drive?
61A5B826     //  A Chrysler Airflow.
5085F40A     //  So, I guess that explains why the tire iron that killed your wife came from a Chrysler.
CF6C6071     //  I want an attorney. 
4ED48ECE     //  I'm not answering any more questions unless I... 
6CFA3553     //  I get an attorney.
622EA8E1     //  Hugo Moller - I'm charging you with the murder of your wife. You'll be arraigned and taken before a grand jury. Book him, Rusty.
CDC765A4     //  With pleasure.
124C484A     //  You nailed the creep, Phelps. Good job, Rusty.
38F4DC8B     //  We're letting you go for now, Moller. Go home and see your daughter and work on your story. It's got more holes than a batting cage.
8F912993     //  That's the guy. Detective? 
973C852A     //  That's him - that's the guy who parked the car, I'm sure of it. 
227AD376     //  Hey! He's getting away!
8B974746     //  It ends here, Hugo. Once we get the janitor's statement, you'll be staring down a murder charge.
7BA95273     //  So... so I'm free to leave? You... you believe my story?
82C3E439     //  I'm not saying another thing until I've seen an attorney.
72E3C052     //  You must accept that I'm innocent!
845FF0CB     //  Why are you... why are you just sitting there?
87AC5493     //  Boys. You've really come through this time, haven't you?
595CBCEE     //  Captain. We were on our way to interview Eli Rooney.
8CC04929     //  Yes, Phelps, I know. 
907E8C10     //  This particular fiend is an old acquaintance. 
7BF0B00A     //  I have tried to reaffirm his belief in a wrathful and terrible God. 
469082E3     //  Whichever way it goes, I'll be dealing personally with him.
AB3884CF     //  You look like you've had it rough.
89E9F833     //  You see me asking for your sympathy, boy?
DB61FF11     //  You're down on your luck, Eli?
4BCD92C2     //  I've had worse. 
106E597B     //  My family ate roadkill during the Dust Bowl.
A7EB1D9F     //  But you have a job. A parolee has to have a job, correct?
A21A865A     //  I had me a job, down in San Pedro. 
467A48E5     //  I'm looking for something new.
61FEA159     //  What kind of job, Eli?
318FBC94     //  Working fishing boats. 
8AD99068     //  Odd jobs around the boatyards. 
372EBABA     //  I'm pretty good with my hands.
6E09614B     //  This place you worked have a name?
F471F0DB     //  Hennessy Marine. 
5798AAC5     //  You cain't miss the place - big yellow letters 'HM' out front.
6A1B8292     //  They give you any workwear, Eli?
B6003077     //  Sure. Green coverall. 
1513C016     //  Dang thing was hot. 
0DFD94A2     //  Felt like I was back in the pen wearing it.
A84DCE4E     //  You better not be lying to me, Eli. If I send an officer down there to find out, and it turns out you wasted his time...
37015667     //  Hell, I ain't lying. That ain't worth lying over.
F38E05CA     //  You looking for some wisdom in that book of yours?
66929D83     //  You killed Mrs Moller and stole her jewelry.
F2566576     //  That ain't so. I ain't done nothing like that.
7B854703     //  Come on, Eli. How else are you going to pay for yourself?
3B260096     //  I got me a pension from the first war. It ain't much, but it does pay some.
7924DE58     //  You have no job - and nowhere to live by the smell of things - and you need money. 
290ADA3F     //  You've been in trouble before, Eli. Who do you think a jury will believe?
15F184BF     //  I've been in trouble for other things but I ain't never killed no one. 
9F611BB9     //  I saw that car come into the parking lot late last night. 
7BA32D71     //  Man got changed there and then put his coveralls in the trunk.

FB78F26D     //  I been around some, son. 
F708BC0F     //  You got some evidence that proves I stole that butterfly from that woman?
61C8368F     //  I done told you I found that pretty thing. I never stole it.
53137906     //  What size boot do you wear, Eli?
611F912D     //  Kind of like anything I can get my hands on. 
96F8BDE6     //  I'm wearing elevens.
51F247A1     //  But if you could choose what size would it be?
A5FFDAA2     //  Elevens.
53FFE9CA     //  You're maybe five-five, five-six tops. And you wear size elevens? I don't think so, Eli.
C31C4CC3     //  That might be on the large side. Maybe tens.
EA7EAA7B     //  Maybe eights.
AB47EB79     //  Now that I come to think of it...
0CFDDC5E     //  Why punish children with your iniquity, Eli?

215D7F3F     //  You must know what you are doing is evil.
B07EF953     //  Well, son... nobody's perfect.
94B191E1     //  Deidre Moller was strangled and then someone did a dance on her torso.

6091CB3F     //  Someone wearing size eights, Eli.
5E6A8D21     //  You got some reason other than you don't like me why you're trying to hang this thing on me?
CEFAE856     //  You can check my boots, son. They're the only pair I've got. 
4345FC2B     //  So I'm warning you - my feet might be a little musty.
66648C0A     //  You ever tie up any of your victims, Eli?
F0078EE7     //  That's not a nice thing to go callin' them.
D7ABDCE8     //  What would you call them?
3B86ED4F     //  I can't say. 
5359F2FE     //  I learnt a long time ago not to go talking about the things I like. 
F2D605E1     //  Talking about it just seems to get people's dander up.
121157EA     //  Answer the goddamn question, Rooney, before I brain you.
14D0158D     //  See what I mean? Short answer is yes.
6B0C9CE1     //  You have any preference regarding rope, Eli?
F8FFCDF6     //  I know a good rope from a bad rope, if that's what you mean. 
EAE96913     //  That's not what you mean, is it? 
1B376E08     //  Any old rope would do me fine.
77376E52     //  Farm boy like you, Eli, must prefer maguey for roping. Am I right?
966F91C4     //  I prefer braid. You tie a hitch in braid, it stays tied.
AC381036     //  Mrs Moller was strangled with a triple braid. 
5F9C97F8     //  Give me something, Eli.
F513429D     //  I like braid but I didn't rope that woman. 
9E1F241D     //  You're not hanging this one on me, partner.
F400A5E2     //  You're lying, Eli. You're a creature of habit. You just get out of jail and you're back to your old ways. You use a specific type of rope.
46B4BA32     //  That may be the case. 
F760187F     //  But you got nothing that says I used a rope to hurt that woman.
6DE4FB73     //  I think you should let me go. 
06A2E7B6     //  Is there some money coming my way for finding that butterfly?
C7B5CDAA     //  I don't like you, Eli. 
06053BCD     //  I think you're an evil man. 
B162BFA7     //  I think you try to pass off your pain to other people.

C2B0E1F7     //  You can count on it, shitbird. By the way, Eli - the Captain and the Hat Squad would like to talk to you next. Any idea what they might want to talk about?
8D6CBF55     //  Interview's over, son. You can go now.
A330781B     //  Go away now, son, and don't be making any more trouble for me.
D61F9F42     //  I've done fourteen years in and out of prison, son. 
04D2E8F9     //  If you think you can outwait me you're wrong.
85763CDD     //  Go on and get, boy. I ain't about to carry on talking to somebody as mixed up as you.
37EADEF4     //  Eli Rooney, I'm charging you with the first degree murder of Deidre Moller.
859D9140     //  You wanna put me back in stir that badly, boy, you go ahead and try. I'll beat that rap. I ain't a killer.
CB6A1419     //  Right, we have our man. Charge and process him. 
B9D21798     //  I have a press conference to organize.

101F2814     //  Why aren't we at the Moller dame's house? This thing is a dead end until we work that place properly.

1FF9A790     //  Everything in this house is evidence. Take a look around.
928B660A     //  Alright. Talk to the girl, but easy does it.
984B4303     //  Get a statement out of the neighbor. Looks like she's got something to share.

BBEB792F     //  Sounds like the broad got messed up between the house and the school. We've been to the house - it's time to try the school.
C75A2228     //  The school, Phelps. Deidre might have got there, she might not. Either way, it's an angle worth checking.
98F23169     //  We need the story on how the car was found. Have a word with the reporting patrolman.
915B04BC     //  Alright. Search the car for physical evidence.
126C9A20     //  The janitor may have eyeballed our bad guy, Phelps. We need to interview him.
5F3CB565     //  You'd better do the talking to this one. Get his statement before I kill him.
EF0FF28B     //  Rooney's on his way to the tank. Let him make himself at home - we should call in.
A2A28795     //  Back to Central, Phelps. One of these assholes will break under interrogation. I guarantee it.

F26F7745     //  Way I see it you need to decide if we have enough to charge this guy, Phelps.

E4FD78E9     //  We need swift and merciless justice for poor Deidre.
B8D9A295     //  I have to say I'm disappointed. I stood in front of a troupe of reporters and made promises - promises of swift and fearful retribution - and you bring me an armful of vagary and happenstance. You made the department look bad, lad. Do it again and your career as a policeman will come to an abrupt and ignominious end. You two are back on the streets. Find street criminals. Roust them, beat them and restore some fervor to your police work. Your next case will come when you've revived my faith in your abilities. Now get out of here.

A3FF8375     //  Okay. Anything else?
24488516     //  To be honest, I just got here, Phelps. Best you talk to Lynch. He's the expert.
AFAF3D9C     //  You ever think about how many people have died in this world, and how big heaven would have to be to accommodate them, Biggs?

1D856A67     //  The Prayer Effect is from the fire. The muscles and tendons contract.
314C193C     //  It doesn't make any sense. Why aren't they scattered around like the rest of the debris?
B0E7EE6B     //  I think they've been moved.
C9FF2DF9     //  Moved?
C92BECF0     //  I think someone moved them after the explosion and before the fire.
CF25F836     //  Can you explain that, please?
1336F773     //  I'm almost positive the cause of death is asphyxiation due to gas inhalation. Look at the parts of their bodies that aren't scorched. The coloring around the fingertips is typical.
6DC08B20     //  They wouldn't have felt a thing.
77336463     //  I think the fire damage is post-mortem. I think someone moved them into this room after the explosion.
1A3829C8     //  It still doesn't make any sense. Why would you run into a burning building?
F374958F     //  So what about the guy we have in jail, Phelps?
EAD8D854     //  We got the wrong guy.
84CEE1B9     //  It's our boy. I think he watches the fires. I think the Sawyer fire went wrong.

DBDC535B     //  This guy wants to burn houses not families. He expects the houses to be empty. 
67B436BF     //  He was trying to redeem himself. 
36D5D2F0     //  He probably thought they'd be happier together.
984E5046     //  You are one very disturbed individual, Phelps. I know you've had it rough lately, but you should start to compartmentalize your thoughts.
A58788D1     //  He could be right.
553091B7     //  I'm sure it's the same guy.
35F8CAD0     //  Are you telling me that some son of a bitch murdered these people, the whole family, and arranged them here like Kewpie dolls?
A61FBE4E     //  It might fit, Cole, but I don't think we could ever prove it. 
10584E4F     //  There's very little evidence.
4140EBF7     //  Evidence!
33498119     //  Albert, check out the hot water system. Make sure we're dealing with the same MO.
F93414F4     //  Sure, Phelps. I'll get back to you.
8C953B0D     //  Leave the rest to us, Cole. You better find out what's eating Biggs.
EF3063FD     //  There isn't much I can tell you right now, Cole.
576760DB     //  You want answers about the fire? Talk to Lynch.
4A3A2CB0     //  Do your job, Phelps. Let me do mine.
280CBF9D     //  No more questions, huh?
E785B8AB     //  This is the flash point. The heater detonated with enough force to expose the foundations.
1F4273A6     //  Looks like the same model.
093ACBB7     //  I'm just making a final sweep before we call in the cleaners, Officer. Nothing new for you.
71604C11     //  No usable evidence out here. Sorry. You'll have to take what you've got and get to work.
CB299BD6     //  We'll make sure Lynch is done before it gets cleared. You go do your thing.
67F12A4B     //  We hosed it down, Detective. The rest is up to you and the tech guys.
5AB9557A     //  So something finally got to you?
5EB43213     //  You want my help, pretty boy, you got it. 
029903BD     //  You keep riding me and you won't be pretty much longer.
A860DD7E     //  We can get this guy, Herschel.
621B2732     //  You think you've seen everything, Phelps? 
CC653A04     //  I was with the 2nd Marines at Belleau Wood. 
D8DA68B8     //  The things that went on in that farmhouse... my own guys, on fire, screaming for a way out...
FE989078     //  We are not going to get this guy. 
4117E886     //  There's going to be no photos and no citations. 
419161B8     //  We are going to kill this miserable fuck. End of story.

00B9667A     //  You remember the list from the travel agent?
CE2F15B8     //  Sure.
3B7B0A41     //  The Morellis were winners too. 
B6E12088     //  Their name was on that list.
9127CF79     //  Christ. 
AC8FB318     //  We should take a look around, work the neighbors, see what they know. 
3EC4FFCE     //  I'll go across the street.
609D3B4F     //  Okay, I'll try this side.
84F09E12     //  I haven't done this for years.
D125D663     //  Someone was keeping watch. Looks like they were here for quite a while. Brand looks distinctive.
3AF938F2     //  Whoever he was, he was wearing boondockers. I would know that imprint anywhere.
5FDAEB6B     //  You don't look like a fireman, son.
4D509E78     //  Standard man's dress shoe.
EC92E15B     //  Boondockers, they ain't.
C483C9ED     //  You've got quite a habit.
34093844     //  LAPD. 
2933A226     //  Can you tell me anything about the fire next door?
FCE0F71A     //  Terrible luck. Imagine - after having won that weekend away.
55D1849F     //  What's your name, sir?
75C5ADA8     //  Forman. Dudley Forman.
F7842AD1     //  Did you see or hear anything that might have...
F324145D     //  Look, we were asleep when we heard the explosion.
4E06F3AB     //  And then what happened?
1D247B43     //  It was like Pearl Harbor with bits of the house raining down. Blew out all of our windows that face the place.
4058D07E     //  You didn't like Morelli, did you?
D246B49A     //  Some neighbors you get along with, some you don't. I guess they should have sold up.
71BAF1A5     //  What do you mean?
3506A92F     //  They're knocking down all these old houses and building a new subdivision for GIs. Morelli was being difficult.
A8E7AAA5     //  You weren't asleep. You were standing over there by the fence smoking cigarettes, watching the place burn down. I hope you didn't know they were inside.
26CFE0D2     //  You weren't asleep. You were standing over there by the fence watching the place burn down. I hope you didn't know they were inside.
04AD68B2     //  As much as I didn't like that wop bastard, I hope you have evidence that proves I was looking at the fire.
CD1B8728     //  I've never smoked cigarettes in my life. You must be thinking of someone else.
03223A5F     //  You said someone is knocking these houses down?
AFE8D6B6     //  Elysian Fields. You must know them... their billboards... that Monroe character beaming down at you. We've had an offer for the house.
4A0CAB15     //  Did the Morellis want to sell?
C11E47B7     //  I don't know.
22DF2266     //  You knew that everyone else had sold up, but you didn't know about your next door neighbor?
230629EC     //  Like I said, we had some history.
6713E79A     //  Whatever you thought of Morelli, his whole family is dead. They couldn't have all deserved that. I want you to help me here, Forman.
F6263FA2     //  Morelli was pig-headed. He'd built the house himself. He didn't want to sell. Stubborn fool was ruining it for all of us.
ED0B94CB     //  You obviously know everything that goes on in this neighborhood. Morelli didn't want to sell, and you know why.
3C0D37B2     //  And how are you going to prove that I know what Morelli was planning, Detective?
DB9F5C30     //  Morelli must have had his reasons. That's all I know.
C06D8E9B     //  Any luck, Cole?
96B2BB43     //  A couple of things. What did you pick up?
F306F059     //  A folded piece of paper.
BCB7FEC0     //  Looks complicated.
D4571807     //  Japanese call it origami. Can I take a look?
CE2F15B8     //  Sure.
D1039A63     //  Paper crane. There is a legend about them. You fold one thousand of these and you get a wish.
FAA16E2F     //  Don't those Japs have anything better to do?
742EA569     //  Hey, don't break it...
C599B8FA     //  I'm not. I'm unfolding it. It looks like a waybill or a flyer.
E57766EC     //  For what?
023162FC     //  For Elysian Fields Developments.
E29A82B5     //  Oh, I see you already have one.
638FD292     //  I don't want to get caught up in any kind of investigation. Can I go back to my radio show?
41014E5A     //  All a man can do is put in a prayer for the dead. That's about all I've got to say about it.
51A53C06     //  Hey, I don't have all day.
4E9382CF     //  Mind if we move things along a little, Detective?
03E73F32     //  God help me, I tried.
5F7193A2     //  But, kid, you stretched my patience a little too thin.
88BD4E3C     //  Get out of my yard.
0099DD0B     //  Thanks for your time, Mr Forman.
4AC2D89C     //  Sure. 
FB6AD1D7     //  Hey - if you're interested, I have one of those competition flyers in the kitchen. 
5C17C8DD     //  I could get it for you if you like?
8CDB0E02     //  That would be great.
99D72CB5     //  I'll have a patrolman come by and take your statement. Hopefully you'll be a little bit more cooperative with him.
4C72FA42     //  Come on, kid. I'm doing my best here. You were talking about the competition, right? Catalina Island? I've got one of the flyers in the kitchen, if you're interested.
DC877830     //  You smoke heavily, Mr Forman?
E329B129     //  No, I never touch tobacco. Why do you ask?
AD15048D     //  What the hell? Those aren't mine.
37770101     //  Did you see anyone hanging around the Morellis' home prior to the explosion?
7CED4BD4     //  Nope. Can't say as I was looking out, though.
8ECE7923     //  Did they have anyone working on the house recently? A maintenance man? A city inspector, maybe?
B5F831A3     //  I doubt it. 
1E6F03FA     //  Why would they bother with these old places, what with the redevelopment coming up?
5757C75D     //  You sure, Mr Forman? There's signs of someone hanging around over there by the fence.
3F0B936A     //  Hey, now that you come to think of it - there was a guy. Kind of tall, skinny though...
56C6D197     //  Anything else?
4526071D     //  Orange lumber jacket. A beat up hat and no hair. 
19AD93F1     //  I thought he was the pest exterminator guy who was working around here the last few days, 
9934FEE2     //  but that guy had hair.
C33220CE     //  I think you're covering for someone, Forman. Who is it?
BA8424AA     //  And I think you're off your rocker. How can you make an accusation like that? What proof have you got?
815931DD     //  I can see you're the excitable type. You shouldn't let your imagination run away with itself.
73B27007     //  You said the Morellis had won a weekend away. To Catalina Island?
3CA99164     //  Yeah, that's right. First thing I thought after the explosion was 'thank goodness they was away'. But then I find out they were still in there...
5BE86C3C     //  Who was running the competition?
AD4FF56F     //  What? I dunno.
64C9D4FA     //  You didn't enter yourself?
10A605E8     //  I'd already agreed to sell. The competition was an incentive for those who were still thinking about it.
04D147B8     //  I need more, Mr Forman. Tell me what you know about the Suburban Redevelopment Fund.
A26D2877     //  I know nothing about it. I've never heard of them.
8376AA5C     //  I think you know plenty about the competition, Mr Forman. I think Morelli was holding out, and that was threatening all of the other sales that were taking place around here.
A615E1DC     //  That may or may not be true. You can speculate all you like, but you have no way of proving what you just said.
7BE623E2     //  Son, you keep making accusations and I'm going to get annoyed with you.
AD7E1D4C     //  When did the flyer arrive in your mailbox?
9A9D0B38     //  They've been arriving for weeks. This one was in the mailbox when I got home from work yesterday afternoon.
0AFACDCF     //  Elysian has to have a head office somewhere. Call it in, Phelps. Find out the address and we'll pay them a visit.

19B33FD6     //  You're hanging by a thread, Phelps. 
AF0E738A     //  Do you understand?
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
48A1FBFD     //  Good. Have a report on my desk today.
F07C70F2     //  McKelty has warned us off over Elysian.
BE6C6704     //  Makes sense. It's a dead end. 
E85503AC     //  We should check out Rancho Escondido.
9A9DCF90     //  You know the place?
0C5C08E7     //  Sure. Corner of Fountain and Wilton. Let's go.
36BDF26E     //  We are not going to...
75083144     //  Yes, we are.
285FBA0E     //  You just won't let this go, will you, Cole?
D789F9E4     //  You know they're involved somehow. 
3A9328D5     //  You expect me to turn my back on it?
1D601904     //  You're a big boy. 
F98ADEDC     //  I expect you to know which battles are worth throwing my pension away for.
BE30DA05     //  Christ, the whole subdivision. What did I tell you about angry GIs?
485DE7FE     //  You know, there are times when you really miss a nightstick. 
466C9169     //  There's more religion in the end of a nightstick than in a hundred cathedrals.
92AB492D     //  I'm not gonna tell you again, sir.
DF2865BD     //  Don't tell me when and how I can come and go on my own property!
2A556D62     //  It is not safe, sir.
57761CA5     //  You smart-mouth son of a bitch!
54D94921     //  That's done it, Cole. We're gonna have to pacify these poor saps.
E6BA03EA     //  All of you people need to clear the area! You are disturbing the peace! Disperse, immediately!
37C19D06     //  Good thing you showed up when you did, Detectives. 
A0F5A4BB     //  Those folks were baying for blood.
C0ACAEC3     //  These poor bastards. They got every reason to be angry. You guys should take a look around.
6AA21959     //  Hope you can find out who did this. These people have a right to be angry.
01E41E13     //  Phelps! I think I've found something over here.
B8E6229A     //  This is not befitting a GI.
54EA5ADD     //  You've had a bad break, but this isn't the answer.
90A370D3     //  Stand down! That’s an order!
6636BB40     //  You’re being damn foolish, soldier.
D3105808     //  It pains me to do this.

FA99CF54     //  You hear that? Clear out of here before you're hauled in!
F9675076     //  Okay then. Let's see if there's anything left to take a look at.

8233148D     //  The mortar is like dust. Is that normal in a fire?
506529DA     //  You would expect some shrinkage in the heat but it looks like the cement barely adhered to the brick.
E9112EB9     //  Doesn't appear to be any wall ties either. This thing looks like it was built on the cheap.
C5A0CCB7     //  Not much left, is there?
C7547865     //  The front path and the mailbox. That's about it.
0664A99D     //  Just the mailbox left. Not much for you to look at.
1CEF0112     //  Another residential. I hate residentials. You should take a look around.
852E4608     //  Excuse me, Detective. Gotta keep the smoke down till we're sure that she's safe.
A7636457     //  There's not much we can do for you in the way of evidence. The place is barely standing up.
82651F57     //  Finding one is convenient, two a coincidence, but three?
A869E9CC     //  Yeah, you're right. It's about time we paid Elysian Fields a visit.
04F70B13     //  Another Elysian leaflet...
EDAE3C62     //  We need Chapman.
2866E897     //  Can't let you in the place, Officer. Sorry.
22F84429     //  You can search around all you like, just as long as you stay outside.
1A2B2A97     //  We were too late to save anything. Sorry.
227E4077     //  You're not gonna find anything in there, buddy. Evidence wise, the place is a write-off.
FEF4A2BE     //  Welcome to Elysian Fields.
A9F0293F     //  Leland Monroe and Elysian Fields are about as connected as they come in this town, Cole.
C01C0B00     //  What more can they do to me, Herschel? I haven't got a lot left to lose.
4EF4B267     //  Detectives Phelps and Biggs, LAPD, to see Leland Monroe.
656E290E     //  Do you have an appointment?
E47B8ACB     //  We're the police, lady. We don't need an appointment.
9D93D1EA     //  Can I tell him what it's about?
BE9FED55     //  It's an official investigation.
8C352B2B     //  There are two police officers here to see Mr Monroe.
E1EF244A     //  Send them through.
81F3B12A     //  And that’s our cue. Thanks, ma'am.
5073762E     //  All I can tell you about Mr Monroe is that he is a good employer and a fine American.
6DA75DE7     //  I won't have a bad word said about Leland Monroe. Mr Monroe is improving the lives of ordinary families. That's very noble.
695C2E28     //  May I help you, gentlemen?
FA2F2001     //  I wonder how many more layers we gotta go through to get to this guy?
457B12D5     //  We would like to speak to Mr Monroe.
CD6BC734     //  I'm afraid it's impossible. Mr Monroe's schedule is booked weeks in advance.
F3E7AC28     //  Cut to the chase, sister. Is he in?
476C5531     //  I'm not at liberty to reveal that, Officer.
9F84B199     //  So he hired you for your intelligence?
62BA395D     //  I find that offensive.
AED2B9E4     //  You have every right to.
D38427BD     //  This is getting us nowhere, Miss...?
7887B5E2     //  Cansino.
306D4888     //  Would you like us to return with a warrant?
39A735C7     //  That won't be necessary, gentlemen. Come into my office.
C835305E     //  Are you deaf? Go. Away.
D983CC56     //  I am not prepared to let you waste any more of our time. Please leave.
BFB81B43     //  Who are you? How did you get in?
7B228814     //  Detectives Phelps and Biggs, LAPD. We'd like to ask you some questions.
64F4A9C6     //  Oh. Why didn't you say so, Officer?
BBACC5B6     //  Would you like a cigar? Drink, boys?
028E2531     //  Sure, I'll have a scotch.
3D17A1A7     //  Biggs!
A545C9FA     //  We're investigating a series of domestic fires, Mr Monroe.
2256A12A     //  That's terrible, boys. How can I help?
8FCF935C     //  Elysian Fields and Suburban Redevelopment Fund flyers keep turning up in the vicinity of the fires.
F293F078     //  They're turning up all over town, boys. 
F8CE3411     //  Can you imagine the current demand for housing?
1F6254FD     //  So that's your explanation, Mr Monroe? Coincidence?
A452951F     //  Explanation? 
86E0C6B4     //  Why, what's to explain? 
F145DBC9     //  I advertise on radio and billboards for buyers and I advertise for sellers using waybills.
E4AA518E     //  What's your connection to the Suburban Redevelopment Fund?
AB3CE9B5     //  It's an organization of civic-minded individuals whose goal is to make the city a better place for its inhabitants. It's something I was proud to be asked to join.
4EAA6E2B     //  We found a family burnt out in their home. 
599ED410     //  Another house burned to the ground, another Elysian Fields flyer.
DB931573     //   Our information is that they didn't want to sell.
4D63F083     //  Are you saying that's something to do with me? 
7978F374     //  Is that your point?
9343AAD0     //  Point is, every time we find a family barbecued we find one of your flyers. Is that good advertising?
77D682C3     //  We hear that Suburban is under severe time pressure to complete work on the new houses. I think you're getting heavy-handed about it and it's gone wrong.
0DE788BD     //  I hope you have some proof of how I'm involved in this. I'll be happy to sue you for whatever you are worth.
A4692BA2     //  Rancho Escondido burned to the ground last night. That's one of my prestige developments. I'm a victim of these fires too, Detective.
41893C45     //  You've made offers to buy houses in areas where fires have been recorded.
AA86AF7E     //  Are you suggesting that I'm burning people out of their homes... so that I can sell them new ones?
DA128A20     //  The arsonist - do you have any suspects?
06B02B43     //  We aren't at liberty to say.
AAD6DF50     //  I didn't think so. 
82489467     //  The contractors I use for waybills - do you suppose it could be any of them? 
189A0729     //  I have a list of their names if it'd be of any help.
A74E6B8A     //  That would be very helpful, Mr Monroe.
6B7006CE     //  Glad to hear it. I'm always happy to help the LAPD.
D1A09EC3     //  My secretary will provide you with that list.

A5F36F95     //  We need something to go on otherwise more people will get hurt and you'll keep losing houses.
374A2CB0     //  Well, I want to help in any way I can, Officers. 
019B2CB1     //  The contractors I use for waybills - do you suppose it might be one of them? 
C6454213     //  I have a list of their names if it would be of any help.
E086D5C1     //  My secretary will provide you with the list. On your way out.
54EA08B7     //  Boys, I've given you all the time I can spare. I'm a very busy man. Off you go and catch this maniac.
AA24D6F9     //  Glad to be of help, Officers.
B6F59BE1     //  What's the story? Any of these names ring a bell?
764868FD     //  You will excuse me now.
0804A9F3     //  That's enough for now, Detectives.
07D6471D     //  I hope that's all.
B0FB23D4     //  Can we speed this up a little?
30F908E1     //  Can't say I've enjoyed this little encounter, boys, but it was enlightening. Time for you to run along.
8A944275     //  What do you know about a competition for families to win free vacations to Catalina Island?
823F0E51     //  My company runs many promotions. 
B9830ADA     //  I'm not familiar with that one.
80EAE37B     //  The travel agent has a list of the winners. Three of the names on that list have had their houses burnt to the ground.
4F112020     //  And how many names on the list have not had a fire?
C11E47B7     //  I don't know.
0C4108C3     //  You wouldn't make much of a lawyer, Detective. If you're going to rely on statistics then you better get them straight.
AB326D4B     //  Two families are dead, Mr Monroe. This isn't a question of criminal liability. We're looking at conspiracy to commit murder.
E42A857B     //  Do you know who you are talking to, son? You want to use incendiary language like that with me, I suggest you should leave immediately.
B5ACAA8F     //  Level with me, Mr Monroe. You know all about the vacation offers.
0B4B46CD     //  You can believe whatever you like, son. You're missing the vital ingredient called proof.
7CFA6170     //  Your face is all over the flyers, Mr Monroe. You know about the prizes and you're aware that they get given to holdouts.
31ACE128     //  My face is the brand. It's on all our advertising. 
1E319369     //  Did you know that the Mayor and the Chief of Police are 
DEB8D1B3     //  part of the Suburban Redevelopment Fund? 
7909045E     //  Do you want to accuse them of murder as well?
968A860C     //  You come in here making stupid baseless allegations and you think you can ruin my day? We'll see about that.
409D5F83     //  What happens to your plans if a family like the Morellis refuses to sell?
9DDC863C     //  We work around them. Business finds a way. 
A0E9B097     //  That's the American way.
FA503BBE     //  So it's for the greater good then? 
15CB5E39     //  One man standing in defiance of what you think is 
A32FBF84     //  best for the city... 
F339E773     //  I thought an American's home was their castle.
8A4BBC50     //  I'm not sure I like your tone, son.
4C0EC948     //  Come on, Mr Monroe. You expect me to believe that you would build a new development with one of those old piles smack bang in the center of it?
4CEA92AE     //  Progress is an inexorable process, Detective. Those who choose to stand in defiance are usually confined to the waste basket of history. To answer your question - yes, we would build around them if we had to. Most people see sense.
6424B800     //  I think you're being less than candid, Mr Monroe. You're building these homes to some timetable. You're under pressure to get rid of the holdouts.
55FA6C41     //  And how exactly do you think you can prove that in a court of law, Detective?
0A7C15A4     //  Every developer is under time pressure, son. 
6A1A2026     //  On one hand you got the investors who want a return, 
21D45F6A     //  on the other, the purchasers who want what they paid for. 
80BB55CD     //  That's business. 
451FE234     //  Now, are we finished?
FB97B452     //  What's Elysian Fields' involvement in Rancho Escondido?
A5D849E2     //  One of our latest housing developments. It was due to open on the weekend. Or was, before the unfortunate conflagration.
FBC3DD2A     //  It met with building code regulation?
1E24F644     //  Absolutely. Only the best for our returning heroes.
373424D4     //  Do you have building plans, material requisition information, work logs? Records of any kind that we could see?
A531F6D6     //  I'm sure we do, Detective. I'll tell you what - I'll have someone pull the paperwork from the archives and get back to you.
9CDB6DC0     //  Mr Monroe, I can have every building inspector from the city and the county going over those buildings...
3B304FAA     //  Son, you have me shaking in my boots.
7032DA51     //  You're lying, Monroe. There's something out of kilter about that development.
83482B67     //  Son, I've had enough of you and your fidgety friend. There's no way in hell you can prove that my materials were inferior.
D9AFC9A5     //  I'm no expert, but I think we'll find that the bricks being used on those houses are undersized 
20D04A5D     //  and the mortar is faulty.
63D580EB     //  And there's no wall ties connecting the masonry to 
4B79C61F     //  the frame.
6C519998     //  Every building is built to a budget, boys. 
33530171     //  Those buildings were inspected and fully insured by California Fire and Life. 
752B61B2     //  Investment of that magnitude demands it. 
98FDD12A     //  Do you think they'd vouch for the buildings without 
65CA7C8A     //  examining them?
7893E68E     //  No offence, son, but you don't have the first goddamn idea what you're talking about.
290C9ADC     //  Herbert Chapman is on this list.
EE9B004D     //  Find a phone. We need to know where we're at with Chapman.
7DAB5FE2     //  Your boss is a fine man.

80D19912     //  Let me find out for you... 
6C017266     //  he was released this morning, Detective.
B0DE8AC2     //  Damn!
9D44C253     //  Not your fault. Can you give me a last known address and put out an APB on the guy?
6977D47E     //  I'll get back to you, Detective. APB will go out over KGPL shortly.
7916701E     //  Thanks for your help.
90660955     //  We're looking for Herbert Chapman.
CC0D4A85     //  I'm looking for him, too. I need him to move his car so I can mow the lawn.
CA661894     //  He's definitely not here?
4EBD62A6     //  I've been banging on his door off and on for a couple of hours. He's out somewhere.
347D25FA     //  You find Herb, you tell him to shift that goddang jalopy.
71B44BCB     //  If Herb is in trouble, there ain't nothing I can tell you about it.
7867344F     //  Let's see what he's hauling around.
FDC745F6     //  Definitely gives him opportunity.
E30B3D1E     //  We should revise the APB. He's clearly armed.
2CC381CE     //  Motive, opportunity and hard evidence.
7D75AD64     //  Hold it, Cole. There he is. It's Chapman, he's coming out of the laundromat.
5069E33A     //  Shit, he's seen us.
2D029A99     //  Cops. Again.
81B87F81     //  Son of a bitch! He must have caught the trolley. We gotta move fast, Cole.
6BE54D1B     //  Christ. That trolley's out of control. Chapman must be driving.
F6CEFDF2     //  Stay on his ass, Cole. Don't lose him.
F0958557     //  Hold him tight, Cole. As soon as he ditches the tram we'll be there to grab him.
7D7EA24B     //  See if you can damage one of the wheels. Might act like a brake and slow the thing down.
B6B016F2     //  He's gonna kill someone at this rate. Smash the wheels again.
D57AF458     //  Look, Cole, the side plate's gone! Get me closer, I think I've got a shot here.
63772AE9     //  Get me closer to the driver's cabin, I'll plug Chapman.
D557FB6D     //  If you pull alongside, I'll try and wing the son of a bitch.

538E53A6     //  Herbert Chapman. You're under arrest.
85B6DC5D     //  Looks like we have our man, Cole. Well done.
015EC447     //  I'm not so sure.
8AB58EC1     //  Chapman seemed to have his own agenda.
FD3716AA     //  There seems to be more to this than a personal vendetta.

3AB06FA9     //  The fires benefit Elysian in some way. I don't see Chapman and Monroe working together.
44012752     //  You have a point, but the evidence is good for Chapman. It's hard to be worrying about his side of the story when he's blasting away with that big .45.

A5C1F573     //  No.
5073AFB1     //  Not even for old time's sake?

C6A71651     //  Save the threats for someone who cares about them, Roy.
37298ACF     //  You're breaking my heart, Cole. You know how I feel about you...

89CF7FE0     //  Doctor Harlan J. Fontaine
B657A31D     //  Doctor Harlan J. Fontaine is implicated in the supply and distribution of narcotics in the greater LA area. In his capacity as a clinical psychiatrist he has dispensed large quantities of contraband morphine to drug dealers and users under the pretext of prescribing treatment for his 'patients'.
A0C46303     //  Between July 18th and September 3rd, 1947, twenty two suspects arrested for narcotics possession claimed that the drugs were 'medications', given to them to alleviate the symptoms of various psychiatric illnesses. Several showed paperwork to this effect. No pattern was noticed by arresting officers however, and no further action taken since each charge amounted to no more than a misdemeanor, and the suspects were processed across four separate divisions (Central, Hollywood, University, and Highland Park).
664C8AB4     //  On September 7th, 1947, after a lengthy interrogation, suspect Reginald Barclay offered the name of an associate he knew only as 'Doc Fontaine' (see interview transcript 5.10.090747). Barclay stated that Fontaine was the selling party in a deal he brokered with Willie Baines Foster, yet to be apprehended. Foster is known to LAPD Administrative Vice as a high-ranking courier for Meyer Harris Cohen.
C6710445     //  On August 29th, again on September 6th, and then again on September 12th, 1947, Doctor Fontaine visited a men's haberdashery on Sunset Boulevard – a haberdashery known to be owned and operated by Meyer Harris Cohen. On all three occasions Doctor Fontaine was inside for more than an hour. Two days after his final visit, on September 14th, a shipment of morphine with a street value of $4,000 was moved from a house in Brentwood to an East Downtown warehouse, whereupon it disappeared.
743EB874     //  It is the opinion of this officer that Doctor Harlan Fontaine is a significant figure in the supply and distribution of narcotics in Los Angeles, with close ties to organized crime. I recommend that he be kept under close surveillance until such time as a comprehensive legal brief can be assembled.

EBD1249A     //  You look lovely, Princess. You haven't exactly caught me at my best.

77F93604     //  I'd like to explain...
611CEF0E     //  I can join the dots, Elsa.
7E1CEC7A     //  Cole needs your help, Jack. The police department have frozen him out.
F2AD9B4B     //  Look, you're obviously a brave lady but you can't fight all Cole's battles for him.
26F75683     //  I just wanted to apologize for...
D2943E1A     //  You don't have to apologize, you were right about Elysian Fields. Tell me something... What was Lou Buchwalter's regular job?
48972E42     //  He was a carpenter.
3A9CB75A     //  He built sets for RKO and Warner Bros.
36A690D0     //  A set carpenter? Perfect.
AC791A17     //  If you don't mind, Elsa, I'd like to get a little rest now. I've got a lot more dots to join and it's making my head hurt.
FCE0514F     //  That's perfectly understandable, Mr... Jack.
1EB2AAD1     //  I hope we can meet again under less dramatic circumstances.
7DAD1016     //  I hope so too, princess.
FFCF0771     //  I'd like that.
55B42E0B     //  Are you Kelso?
B5A5C072     //  Who's asking?
48D10B36     //  Petersen. Assistant DA.
E684FF6C     //  You're in the wrong building, Petersen. This is a hospital.
DEAA5E57     //  A wise guy.
184749B4     //  Let me tell you a story, Kelso...
528E4FA7     //  Can I get the abridged version? My head hurts.
1E7F5BE6     //  You're a funny guy, Jack.
2A62750A     //  What do you want, Petersen?
8957C389     //  A colourful character mentioned your name... He said that you might know something about...
CC0D746E     //  That's the trouble with people like you, Petersen. First your colourful character sends you over a drink, then he buys you dinner, then he phones you up in the middle of the night for a favour. Try rubbing shoulders with some solid citizens - they're the people you're supposed to protect.
6D5275BD     //  You finished, Kelso?
6BB76C2E     //  For the moment.
34B7C58D     //  I'm going to run for DA, Kelso.
8CAA3703     //  The current administration stinks.
8C46FE07     //  And you want me to help?
1E08FF9A     //  I'm looking for a DA's investigator. You get a gun and a badge and $120 a month.
D5AA9757     //  I get $150 a month now.
68FB4946     //  I've got something better... How about Leland Monroe?
ADDF3DDC     //  The property developer?
D8258BF9     //  Do you think I fell down the stairs?
4F132F34     //  Remember me?
CFB65110     //  Jack, its good to see you. You've caught me at a slightly inopportune moment. Can we do this some other time?
435F6BBD     //  Back off, Curtis. Move away from the door...
5E15B4D6     //  Jack, there's no call for that...
4FA80CD0     //  You're smooth, Curtis, I'll give you that. You try to get me killed and you still manage to be polite about it.
AD1635F9     //  Jack, how could you accuse me of having anything to do with that?
42A06F7B     //  I want to know all about you and Monroe, Curtis. You give it up or I beat it out of you.
A619FDD2     //  Get the fuck out of here, Jack. You're fired. Who do you think you are? Get out of town now while you still have the chance. You have no idea what kind of forces you are dealing with here.
84EA6F16     //  I guess we've exhausted the passive options.
CD8062BB     //  Jack Kelso?
B5A5C072     //  Who's asking?
BF5BDCF8     //  Leland Monroe.
6B885774     //  I was wondering when you'd get around to calling.
C82DFC98     //  I'd like to meet with you, Mr Kelso.
3F39D8DD     //  I bet you would, Mr Monroe, but I value my skin highly enough to not want to meet with you. Why don't you just send your boys around and we'll have a nice cup of tea.
B8EE8DDE     //  You realise that I can make you a very wealthy man, Mr Kelso?
76CECC68     //  Better than $220 a month?
E36807B2     //  You're a very witty man, Kelso. Substantially better.
A89CF7C2     //  I'm going to have to let it slide, Mr Monroe.
77D567F4     //  Are you haggling with me, Jack?
549CE352     //  I might be.
84A37A7D     //  Come around to my place at nine. It's on 
4F070728     //   in Beverly Hills. You'll come?
50F02D1C     //  I might. Good night, Mr Monroe.
2DD71D55     //  These are the guys who killed Courtney. I want a minimum of noise and no prisoners.
90E4B5CA     //  No prisoners? This isn't Pelileu, Jack.
289513B7     //  You heard me.
702722A6     //  Its OK, Jack, we all feel the same way. It just hasn't turned out quite the way we imagined.
E66FC9D3     //  These guys are grifting GI's. That's what they do for a living. None of this will help Courtney but it will help some of the other suckers. Let's get it done. Teams of two. At the ready.
6C99AE8C     //  You're a very sweet-looking girl to be holding such a big gun.
178DD43B     //  I know how to use it, mister.
C4E9B6DD     //  I'm sure you do. So how about pointing it over there in the direction of Hollywood instead of at me, Princess?
D14D55F6     //  You're quite the wiseguy.
C5A43A46     //  I don't normally shoot women, Princess. How about putting the cannon down?
B5FA490F     //  I didn't think you had the guts, Sweetheart. I was never very good at reading women.
516F0AC4     //  That's my opening negotiating position.
62A44C5D     //  I thought I had an invitation, Monroe. Your boys outside were certainly expecting me.
99E77E5F     //  That's my second offer.
E1009330     //  You sadistic bastard... What do you want?
401EE826     //  I want to know about you and the Mayor and those Trojan houses that you're building.
78852E6A     //  It can't be stopped, Kelso. There's too much money at stake.
A7E7C012     //  Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall, Monroe. Ask the Emperor of Japan.
00DC52D5     //  Have some fucking mercy.
DDAFFB66     //  Thank God...
4ACA3CC5     //  Operator, put me through to Phelps, Arson Squad. Yeah, Biggs, it's Jack. I'm at Monroe's. If you get over here in a hurry you might get something before he bleeds to death.
259D4F33     //  Elsa... Where?... Fontaine... Dead... A former patient...
F5D77628     //  So that crazy son of a bitch finally came back for a checkup.
14714E5B     //  It's Monroe, he's raving.
507D641D     //  You want information, cocksucker? You get me some medical help.
A4A17F97     //  I gotta go, Herschel. Monroe's negotiating again.
F30B9D10     //  Do you want my final offer, Leland?
58C90AD2     //  A name, Monroe.
9990E4C2     //  I don't have a fucking name. He worked as a bug sprayer... Get me a God-damned doctor.

AD1635F9     //  Jack, how could you accuse me of having anything to do with that?
4B7B727B     //  I want to know all about you and Monroe, Curtis.
4AF1BFF6     //  You give it up or I beat it out of you.

4B69EDE0     //  I knew you were in bed with Elysian, Curtis. 
27C93D2C     //  Now I know why.
F599D58B     //  I want answers, Curtis, so pay attention.
E1F9E982     //  Please, Jack. I'm not a violent man.
98EBA19F     //  Tell me about the Suburban Redevelopment Fund.
B8116FE6     //  You're talking about the future of Los Angeles. You cannot interfere with these plans.
2AF501F5     //  Information, Curtis.
627F411A     //  Business people who have joined forces to meet the demand for new homes.
B4D2EC98     //  There's more to it than just the homes. The homes are junk. They were never built to move into.
50EAAB11     //  Well done, Jack. You're a bright boy. Where does that get you?
049ECF8C     //  You and Monroe are going to scam those guys out of their GI bond.
A6707C86     //  Jack, you are so naive.
65112DFF     //  You're lying, Curtis. They're going to burn those movie sets they call houses, and you're carrying the insurance on them.
2310B463     //  And how do you prove that, Jack?
53087F1D     //  Rancho Escondido burnt to the ground. California Fire and Life is carrying the paper.
5EE55E84     //  Jack, the best result you could get from insurance would be replacement cost. The stakes are much, much higher.
34AB2A1B     //  I thought not. 
9D1CDB04     //  Now help me up, Jack, and I'll give you ten minutes start before I go for the phone.
FB584015     //  I don't get it, Curtis. You're Vice President of the company. Why take the risk?
984A98AE     //  It's a simple business transaction, dear boy.
F0389BB7     //  You must have worked years to get to the top of the company. You're prepared to throw that all away?
C8D88BEA     //  Life is full of tiny moments of opportunity. You either seize them or get left behind.
C2BF882F     //  What is it with you people? How can you live any better? You already have houses, cars, yachts...
EC5C4766     //  Greed and avarice are very powerful forces for change, Jack. Combine that with the city's desire for progress, and it's a very heady cocktail. You'd need to be a very special man to be able to resist that.
BBBA5D72     //  You're lying, Curtis. Something happened at the company, didn't it? That's why you took the bribe.
C2BE8237     //  Bribe! 
5E008B8D     //  What bribe? 
166A5C98     //  How can you accuse me of benefiting ahead of the company?
23A44169     //  I notice that the share certificates are in your name, Curtis, not the company's. What did you use as collateral?
94C036AA     //  Those sons of bitches in Sacramento. They passed me over for President. Sent me here because they believed it was a backwater. But they were wrong. Los Angeles will become the capital of the west, not San Francisco. This place will be the city of the twentieth century and I'm going to get my cut, Jack.
5D78970E     //  You're going to jail, Curtis. You and your cronies.
E271CEAA     //  We'll see about that, Jack.
489E001D     //  Maybe you didn't hear what I said - you are fired. The way this company is run is no longer any of your goddamn affair.
F0A6D6FB     //  Why the big payoff in the Buchwalter case? It was bound to bring it to attention.
730C7C94     //  Who could have predicted this particular confluence of events? 
5D8CBEDB     //  Elsa Lichtmann as the beneficiary who spurns the cash, 
F3294A4F     //  the brilliant but flawed detective becoming her lover, 
4D675C92     //  and you, Jack, taking their bait.
A4EADA93     //  You buy green lumber and use it to build houses. How do you expect it to end?
FF8E4130     //  Mr Monroe has a fine reputation for building houses. What would I know about his choice of building materials?
A5AC49BD     //  The DA will cut you a deal if you turn state's evidence.
79F0B595     //  Nice try, Jack, but I don't think so.
737682E7     //  Give me what I need or I'll beat it out of you!
92A536DD     //  It's all there in the case file, if you know what to look for.
DC91A5CA     //  You smug son of a bitch. You're lying again. It's an insurance scam, pure and simple.
F31FD825     //  And how do you prove that, Jack? My assessors wrote the policies on the houses.
DF85AEE0     //  I only approve the reports, Jack. I'm the rubber stamp. This doesn't come back to me.
EC9996F1     //  Very neat, Curtis. Maybe I can't work it out... 
B26BEF9A     //  but Phelps can. He may be many things, 
F3F94F1C     //  but he is one of the best detectives the LAPD has ever had.
70B5A282     //  My, Elsa Lichtmann certainly has you boys mixed up. Since when do you care so much about Buchwalter, Jack?
48A06BB5     //  Since I found out his case brings you and your friends unglued. Phelps will put it together, Curtis. You can count on it.
838D201C     //  Your card is marked, Jack. You'll have an unfortunate accident if you don't leave town.
991A84DE     //  It's time to retreat, Jack. Live to fight another day. Get out of town.
D0DB6E41     //  You should be running.
EE4DDC92     //  You know they're coming after you.
FE7BF4AD     //  Don't you walk away from me, Jack. Don't you take another step.
175F03AD     //  This has been a nice chat, Jack, but we really ought to wrap it up. You're going to be looking over your shoulder forever after today.
19DD0D3C     //  How old are you, Princess?
8E781FD7     //  How old are you?
FD2129A8     //  Sixteen, mister.
4E2B7C20     //  How old are you really?
4276D74D     //  ... nearly thirteen.
5B33BD1D     //  You take love where you can find it as you get older, Jack.
3C4CC62B     //  Love? That has nothing to do with love, Curtis.
82283330     //  Some might find your romantic notions endearing, Jack. I find them very tiring.
41244665     //  You're finished, Curtis.
A315A7AB     //  That remains to be seen, Jack.
3E97EDE7     //  I haven't told you about my new job, Curtis. 
E6ACE016     //  DA's investigator.
AD45941B     //  Who do you think the DA reports to, Jack?
9DB5039F     //  Get dressed, you're getting out of here.
CA2A3827     //  He's not so bad. 
EA9F5C90     //  He just lays on top of me and grunts for a few minutes. 
450EA1BB     //  He's kind and he buys me nice things.
32872D37     //  Get dressed. You're leaving.
63BF42A0     //  She will only come back.
1634ED01     //  I'm just going up to my office, Barty. Gotta check over some files.
8B6143D6     //  Take the elevator, first door on the right when you come out. You know the way, Kelso.
3481A3FE     //  Ain't you got work to do, Kelso?
447D8AC6     //  Hey, Kelso, your office is upstairs. Why don't you go into it and do your job?
0516C706     //  So, Curtis, what is it you don't want me to see?
C71F3E0D     //  Insured replacement value for the house is $900. Current value of the house and land is $3500. Christ, how many of these dumps are we carrying on the books?

3CC8EF13     //  She's awful easy on the eye for a foreign girl.
BAEB2066     //  Does that private dick patter actually work on anyone, Kelso? 
6422B0B6     //  It's not your style. You were always a little more direct...
A26FA12E     //  This is your dime, Officer.
31167696     //  Would you have helped me if I asked, Jack? A little chuck on the shoulder, shout of 'Semper Fi'?
522AC1B8     //  Fuck you, Cole. Be a man. Why send a woman to do your dirty work? You're a cop. Why do you want my help?
B63F263C     //  I thought a PI might be a little more discreet.
41038468     //  I'm no gumshoe.

BEED91CB     //  I'm sorry about a lot of things.
D2065006     //  Is that an apology, Cole?
DC471CB0     //  It's a feeble attempt at one, yes. 
910126DA     //  Look, Jack, it's a murder case and I need help to solve it.
5FE66961     //  So what's it got to do with Elysian Fields Developments?
8D0C0278     //  They're in it somehow. Their flyers keep turning up whenever I find a domestic fire.
CD33D5F1     //  They're boosters. Stiffing GIs for deposits, making 'em wait months for a throw-up house. 
3BE9FDF2     //  They are already making more money than they can count. What's turned them into killers?
E3CE6E83     //  So you believe me?
03322699     //  This is why you dragged me into the Buchwalter case.
08FB72A8     //  Look, Jack, I'm sorry. 
F0AB583E     //  But if not for me, do it for some of the poor saps who are dying 
D513A220     //  or some of the leathernecks who are getting grifted. 
C771310A     //  How about it, Jack?
9BC7899A     //  I know you, Cole. 
C825A8F3     //  You're still beating yourself up over that medal on Sugar Loaf. The medal you think you didn't deserve. 
DB60B5B0     //  But you just don't get it. 
A4399ABC     //  Nobody deserves a medal, it's just the ridiculous situation you find yourself in and how you react to it. 
F9B4D47B     //  You think you failed up on that hill but courage isn't a tap you can turn on or off. Courage isn't permanent. 
F1D41FF0     //  It's a tenuous and fickle thing. Courage and cowardice exist in every man. Get over it.
8512B6E0     //  You got it off your chest?

9F1215BD     //  Phelps, Galloway. You just missed our esteemed colleagues from the fourth estate.
29BA7C77     //  They say timing is everything in life, Ray.
6A0FCA28     //  This looks awfully familiar.
EB18779B     //  I think that's the impression the boys from the Examiner took with them as well.
68C9B06F     //  There's nothing original under the sun. Why should murder be any different?
F33ED179     //  What do we have so far?
3F4F6370     //  Not much trace evidence to speak of. Storm blew in around ten last night and the rain washed most of it away.
9D5D2D88     //  And the body?
92C7851B     //  Looks like she was tipped out of an automobile from the tire tracks and superficial injuries. 
C34E29CB     //  Strangled with a length of rope. 
E0329A48     //  And for my money, it's triple braid again.

B4D50A81     //  Time of death?
3F8E9DAE     //  From her temperature, maybe 2am.

99BD28CE     //  One of the hobo camps around here. He's some kind of hobo leader. They all follow him around.
5887E6CB     //  Sounds like he has the matrons of the neighborhood running scared.
96043EC0     //  He certainly does. He seems to hold court up here. 
6E6A611C     //  He likes it up on this hill. 
4983896A     //  You should do something about it.

51A33CC8     //  And?
2C51E461     //  I was playing Pinochle with some of the guys. Theresa had a few belts too many. She said she wanted to go out dancing.
4FA82EB9     //  You let your drunk wife leave the party and go off on her own?

40D77016     //  She has to go and ruin it. 
7B78E3CC     //  We always have to do what she wants to do. 
BB3721D8     //  Last night she wanted to go dancing.
41EC5434     //  Any idea where?
421B6DEC     //  Where she always goes. 
8F0C7649     //  A bar down on North Beaudry Avenue - Baron's Bar. 
95FA21BB     //  She goes there, drinks too much, gets maudlin, and calls me. I go and bring her home.
2A7B3927     //  So when I call this Bobby Ross character and he tells me you're lying...
FDDEB67F     //  Look, what do I have to do to convince you that I stayed at the party?

734B1332     //  When was the last time you saw your wife?
7949D1AF     //  Around eight thirty. 
DE4F7E8E     //  The card game at Bobby's was wrapping up. 
4AC8C6A2     //  I played out my hand and drove home here, paid the sitter and went to bed.
7A3D520D     //  Why did you only report your wife missing this morning?
A0DC1C22     //  I thought she would have called up last night from the bar.
CBB003E4     //  In sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, Lars.
A495407D     //  And you're the perfect husband, I suppose?
6BE07B83     //  You're lying, Lars. You didn't come straight home, did you?
7A850B8E     //  And how do you figure that?
D06E32DE     //  I came back here and went to bed. Why is that so hard to believe?
6A3F4327     //  You were out in the rain. You got soaked, Lars. We found your wet weather gear.
F7345EC7     //  Okay, I stayed a little later than I said. 
0880A5AF     //  This cute little brunette was hitting on me. 
32C8AA72     //  Theresa noticed. I was half cut. 
ED69C202     //  I walked her home from Bobby's, but nothing happened. 
E10F5BED     //  I walked back and got the car this morning.
6A5249DF     //  Mr Taraldsen, was Theresa happy at home?
CDB09F5D     //  Yeah, I think she was.
BDC90F0F     //  But not last night?
64FCF572     //  She wanted to go dancing. 
3D8AEB82     //  I wanted to stay at the party.
6347A3FD     //  Spill it, Taraldsen. 
122F697E     //  We like the look of you for this, so you had better give us something.
D59C1C90     //  We're at the party, she has a few and says she wants to go out dancing. 
89807B52     //  We only have the sitter until nine. 
360C1CFD     //  I get mad, I tell her to go ahead but I'm staying. 
00BB2B2B     //  She storms out. Look, I'm doing well at cards. I hardly ever do well. 
AC43F9E6     //  I married her because she was so much fun but now she drives me fucking crazy.
7B0BFD33     //  What time did she leave the party?
7508BDCE     //  About eight thirty, maybe a little earlier.
C705F984     //  I think you're in an unhappy marriage, Lars. I think you're lying and you would like to get it off your chest.
95B3A9AE     //  You telling me my wife was unhappy? 
FD19C5E2     //  What proof do you have of that?
16653286     //  Why aren't you out there trying to catch the person who did this?
84637D17     //  Do you have any idea why anyone would want to hurt your wife?
10ADBB83     //  No. 
FCD79FE3     //  Everyone loved Theresa. 
6925AC2B     //  She was so full of life. 
2C5987DF     //  It can't be anyone who knew her.
603D64B4     //  So you don't know anyone who would want her dead?
8BE7E949     //  No, I don't.
6868261F     //  For the record, Taraldsen, did you kill your wife?
A68ECF18     //  Oh my God, this... no. 
42F90145     //  I didn't kill my wife. 
15EE8DE9     //  And fuck you for suggesting it.
49D67739     //  I think you're lying, Lars. 
17F244EE     //  I think you were mad at your wife for embarrassing you in front of your friends. 
AD84E48E     //  I think you came back here and strangled her, and then dumped her body on the hill.
8F8852D2     //  You think I strangled my wife? How do you expect to prove that?
4CF43E48     //  Without a scrap of evidence you're ready to pin a murder on me?
8FBE4DCE     //  Your wife was strangled with triple braid rope. 
B94ED417     //  The bowline from your boat is a perfect match.
1D19621F     //  Look, I know this looks bad. 
654BB076     //  I'm going to have to come to terms with the fact that I let her go.
5E66586F     //  Thanks for answering our questions, Mr Taraldsen. You'll need to go Downtown to identify your wife's body.
CB8AC4D3     //  I should have taken her dancing.
9EE1B0D4     //  In my experience, mac, if you give in to broads you'll be giving in to them your entire life.
40B782A9     //  If Bobby Ross doesn't confirm your story we are going to come back here and pick you up. This doesn't look good, Lars.
6D3727B5     //  Please, can I have some time to explain to my daughters?
F928DC6F     //  I can't believe Theresa's dead.
0DF1D050     //  Can I comfort my daughters now?
C2FC2A94     //  If you have more questions, I'd rather get this over with now.
6F98CD03     //  I'm going to try to explain this to my children. And you're going to get the hell out of my house.
D3C674D2     //  You believe this guy's story?
8E1E1D16     //  Kind of rings true.
BAC110ED     //  Maybe. Either way, we need to check the alibi. This Bobby Ross character.
C8163585     //  Can you run an address for a Bobby Ross? Then send some uniforms over.
618836A1     //  Would you like him picked up?
170C4825     //  No. Suspect says he was with Ross last night. We need to confirm the alibi.

04497D4E     //  They're saying it was that Black Dahlia freak again. 
411F4E18     //  Goddammit. I rang that husband of hers. 
54DFF06B     //  The babysitter said he was out.
11AE9A7E     //  If you don't mind, we have a few questions.
693FFC48     //  What time did Theresa leave?
DB05E378     //  Around ten thirty, I think.
18BA28B2     //  On foot, in a car, by bus? How was it?
EB8717B1     //  She called for a cab.
D5ACCD3E     //  Did you get the number?
B5AEADE3     //  Sure I did. I like Theresa. 
66EF5BDD     //  The only time she has a drink is when things aren't going so good at home. I was worried about her.
8F9DB346     //  We don't have time for you to be making guesses. 
BA293C22     //  What time was it exactly?
12339A20     //  Gimme a break. I don't remember it to the second.
F0E7AB84     //  That's a lie. You kept her here until past closing.
AB8A7C6B     //  Say what? 
D8686CEE     //  I'd like to see you go ahead and prove it, pal.
55489130     //  I'm out to help you boys, 
0BF8EADD     //  trying my best to remember something that could help, 
4D8BB763     //  and you throw it back in my face.
115B7BF0     //  3591. Should be traceable.
C54E4EDD     //  Any idea where she was headed?
A662CD5A     //  Nope. I didn't get that.
AAC28578     //  The husband said she wanted to go dancing.
D1A1144A     //  She always wants to dance when she's been drinking. She was trying to talk some guys into taking her to one of the dancehalls.
8AF224B2     //  She was murdered, Benny. Brutally murdered. 
B9B23756     //  If you liked this lady you should give us something.
88509F89     //  You telling me I'm not cooperating? Watch it, pal.
3F5CC850     //  Or maybe you just won't share. You sure no one slipped her a Mickey Finn? Then took her back to their place?
A5961E85     //  Not in my bar, goddammit. You got any proof of her being doped in my bar?
82847BA8     //  Yeah, I thought not. 
10368D6E     //  I keep a tight rein on what goes on in my place. 
253AFB01     //  Make sure you don't go spreading that idea around.
62ABDED6     //  Who was she with? 
2B7FF836     //  We've had reports about a tall, gaunt-looking hobo. 
5ACF7B83     //  He wasn't here last night?
5CA9A4AD     //  I get plenty of bums in here, but nothing to fit that description.
5E2DA9D3     //  You've never served him?
35B49BA3     //  Not a chance. 
3FAAE5F7     //  By the sound of it, he's the type of bum you send packing right when he walks through the door.
EB30691D     //  The likelihood is that whoever she left here with killed her. Give it up, Benny.
96AB37C7     //  Alright, two creeps were all over her. Promising to take her dancing.
1BDF3046     //  You get a good look at these guys?
21DFF466     //  Sure, I got a good look. 
8B72A42E     //  One of them was a sailor. 
9E4A3E21     //  In uniform. His cap said 'USS Indiana'.
2A1C7E3F     //  And the other man?
04350A6C     //  The other guy is Richard Bates. 
2CBDA926     //  He's sitting in the back right now. Red polo shirt.
5FFC49DA     //  Why are you lying, Benny? Why won't you help us out?
0D440923     //  You're crazy, pal. You can prove I know who she left with?
F42EB055     //  There's no upside in talking to cops. 
A758E4B5     //  They always treat you like a criminal.
C8B6C5D1     //  What do you want me to say? Look, mister, I think we're done.
E13DC56A     //  I'd pour you one, but you look somber enough already. See you round.
4E48A8CA     //  Something wrong, pal? I can pour you a couple fingers, if that'll help.
96215550     //  That's it? 
6405FB16     //  Hey, you must be some kind of mind reader, buddy.
3421585D     //  I tried to help, but you ain't having it. 
A8CD1511     //  Better leave before I have to persuade you.
DF13750A     //  You want us to catch the guy, sir, we need information. Not cute answers and delaying tactics.
73868D8C     //  I do my best, goddammit! What do you want from a guy?
177FB8F8     //  Thank you for your help, Mr Cluff. We'll take it from here.
653756A8     //  Hey, no problem.
BE57FADF     //  This is Bates?
73E7328F     //  That's him.
1768F668     //  LAPD. Don't make me chase you, shitbird.
432EE9B8     //  Any of your regulars know the broad?
DB4B9DE2     //  Ask them yourself.
3C1ED64A     //  LAPD. Keep your seats, boys. 
BDD40B45     //  This won't take a second.
A17C29FA     //  Alright, alright! You got me! I've had enough.
F49BECD7     //  Okay, Bates. You're going to answer some questions.
3A2D5837     //  I have a choice in this?
104E4D62     //  Name?
9F6F1A26     //  Richard Bates. What is it you want?
46EA4C99     //  I'll ask the questions. Firstly, why did you run?
85C57EDE     //  I don't mix with cops if I can help it.
2C329576     //  Last night you were drinking with a lady in the bar. 
76E3DFD2     //  You wanted to take her dancing, and now she's dead and your face is all messed up.
88A8D587     //  I'm in the clear on that. She preferred a sailor. 
206388DE     //  You can lay it off on him. Are we finished?
A8C8A9DE     //  Tell us about Theresa Taraldsen.
2B9C2BA9     //  What's to tell?
29D0FCEA     //  Do you want my partner to sap you? Tell us what we want to know.
67075288     //  She was okay. 
6E2600D7     //  Drunk, pissed off at her old man, wanting to go dancing. 
8AADB4D6     //  I thought I'd ply her with a few drinks and get my end away. 
600F474C     //  Looks like your salty had the same idea.
1DF916DF     //  You sure you and the sailor didn't take her somewhere and things got out of hand?
A5ACEA5E     //  Even cops need evidence. 
112A34D6     //  You got nothing on me that links me to that woman.
84FA183F     //  Hate to say I told you so. 
A428A81D     //  Are we done?
0457B42E     //  So what happened when you left the bar?
7ED821C5     //  Sailor boy laid one on me. A cheap shot. 
E12A9201     //  After that I don't know.
C788B81E     //  What happened to the woman?
95636F95     //  Your guess is as good as mine.
7589D09C     //  You've done time, haven't you, Richard? Is that why you ran?
4A97E38D     //  I'm on parole.
6B802FCB     //  On what offense?
7563E76A     //  Sexual assault. 
A88EF82D     //  Look, I was lying there on the sidewalk. 
270D3ED2     //  He flags a cab and jumps in with the broad.
F0FFADBC     //  I don't like it when you lie to me, Richard. You have the stink of the yardbird about you. What were you in for?
368DCE5E     //  I have no idea what you're talking about. 
4473BCF8     //  You got anything says I've done time?
541B2A0F     //  You boys should run along. 
7C3766C6     //  You got a killer to catch, remember?
97340E36     //  We're taking you in, Bates.
5F36F1B0     //  How come?
5CFA5D8A     //  Just for a chat. 
E21FD358     //  A nice, private chat. 
DB8DAA27     //  I'll explain my theory of once a degenerate, always a degenerate.
F90CD6A1     //  You're coming in with us, Bates.
6EF53FC9     //  But I'm not your guy! What exactly am I being run in for?
FCE5BC96     //  You have a record, you ran from us and there's the fact that I don't like you. That's three strikes in my book.
EC7A545E     //  Take him to Central. 
6FC58087     //  He's a material witness in a murder case. 
88EDFCE1     //  Find him a cozy cell.
03C13351     //  Richard here knows the drill.
29273861     //  How many sailors could've been in this part of town drinking last night? 
10F4AD58     //  Put an APB out on the guy, Phelps.
02999DC9     //  Can't a man drink in peace?
E55787E8     //  Hey, buddy. Get your own beer.
73D94987     //  Ain't no call to take me in.
5BF1C3C5     //  This ain't right. I ain't done nothing.
88EE76F6     //  Come on. If we're doing this get it over with.
1046B93D     //  What? Now you're leaving me here in bracelets?
7AA65B64     //  Hey, I'm innocent. And I'm pretty sure you can't just lock me up with no charge or nothing.

E8EC482F     //  Let's start at the beginning.
1F891B94     //  You went to Baron's Bar. What time did you arrive?
497307BA     //  I got a twenty-four hour pass. I got there around seven.
4EB608E9     //  That's where you met Theresa Taraldsen?
4C5958F9     //  Sure. We had a couple of drinks.
1AB16E5A     //  And you started talking...
AB070266     //  She looked good in her green dress. 
5A6515BA     //  Up close she was a little older than I thought but like I said, I only had a twenty-four hour pass.
E0CDBDE6     //  So you tried to make a woman who was incredibly drunk?
C30F8E60     //  Look, I'm not proud of myself but I never hurt her.
766B11F7     //  You took her dancing?
FBCBF084     //  That's right. We caught a cab to the Crystal Ballroom.
BC24ECD3     //  You're lying to me, Jessop. I think you weren't having much luck and you decided to take it out on Mrs Taraldsen.
5AA1DD12     //  That's not true. 
99572296     //  What makes you think I wanted to hurt her?
4BE0985C     //  I'm no John Paul Jones, but I'm no heel either.
C3D523FE     //  You had a fist fight with Richard Bates over Mrs Taraldsen.
27E296BB     //  You met the guy? He's a creep. 
49B6CDFB     //  You should take a look at him for this.
0C3BAB57     //  So you were defending Mrs Taraldsen's honor?
B44E084C     //  Yeah, something like that.
FBAEE681     //  He's pointing the finger directly at you, Jessop.
DCB2E9A5     //  I only had one night before I was back in the tub. He had all the time in the world to look for some action. I belted him. I'd do it again. She was better off with me.
7FFB1A9C     //  Sure. You're a shining example of chivalry, Jessop.
DA39899A     //  I don't believe you, Jessop. You let Bates have it. What's to stop me from thinking that you lost your temper and slugged Theresa Taraldsen, too?
7B0A1020     //  What have you got that says I hurt her? You got nothing on me.
69A4BFD9     //  You should cut me a break. I'm trying to do the right thing here.
21FE69CC     //  The cab driver said that you were getting pretty familiar with Theresa.
9CA03C20     //  That's not how I'd put it.
C492E95E     //  But she wasn't coming across?
82711370     //  No, she wasn't.
8927F06E     //  So the last thing you wanted was her playing hard to get. Did that make you mad, sailor?
8B27714C     //  Yeah, it did. She knew what a guy's looking for. All broads do. Dancing comes second.
FA61B350     //  And what happened at the Crystal Ballroom?
CCF8D406     //  Nothing. Not even a little hand relief. 
09ECF3F0     //  She had another couple of drinks - there was no fun left in her. 
1064F270     //  Just poured her guts out to some bartender.
ADE50890     //  Tell the truth, Jessop. You were running out of time. You wanted to get laid and Theresa wouldn't come across. It made you crazy. So you strangled her with a piece of rope.
8495797E     //  For Christ's sake! That's not true. I felt sorry for her. 
4865DC2B     //  What proof do you have that I strangled her?
6B00C3D6     //  I've never struck a woman in my life. I've done a few things I'm ashamed of, but that's not one of them.
DDE59DAF     //  Where did you go after the Crystal Ballroom?
53940482     //  I think the wind had gone out of her sails by then. She caught a cab and I caught a bus back to the base.
7867CD79     //  What time was that?
B56C87E3     //  Around 2am maybe.
DE2DC126     //  We have three suspects. You, the husband and Bates. But you were the last person she was seen with. You had better give me something, Jessop.
DD75C8C2     //  I came in here on my own when I heard the news. That's gotta count for something.
47E109FA     //  You're lying, Jessop. Tell me where you went.
D72BCA5D     //  I'm telling you I caught a bus back to the base. 
A50EF2C9     //  What makes you say different?
9F3A73AD     //  Why would I have walked myself right in here if I had something to hide?
EDED36FD     //  We spoke to the cab driver. 
8D5A936E     //  Tell us what really happened at the Crystal Ballroom.
893B2424     //  I'd had enough. 
EA1922D7     //  She was all upset about her husband, bawling about her kids. She looked old. We left around closing. 
B63C2616     //  Maybe one thirty? 
937E3FF1     //  We got on a bus and she fell asleep on my shoulder.
F3BC677A     //  Which bus?
14329658     //  An All American, two four nine.

B93E4E9B     //  She jumped off and I stayed on it Downtown. 
F93775B3     //  After that I caught another bus to San Pedro. 
1C1543B1     //  The Indiana is down there. She's being scrapped.
21742AFF     //  And that was the last you saw of Theresa?
A336D05C     //  Yeah, that's right. We didn't say much. I think she was kind of embarrassed.
02BD9FDD     //  I think I oughta talk to an attorney.
2AB3C97D     //  I don't think I should say anything more.
4334C629     //  My CO is gonna kill me.
9B92A0B7     //  We doing this or what? I got a ship to catch.
D612B5F8     //  Well, I'm done helping you. 
6EC1CD1D     //  Go ahead and put in me a cell or turn me loose.
B429316F     //  We're holding you till we can clear this with the driver.
29884EFE     //  Yeah. My CO said as much.
ED3C782E     //  If your story doesn't check out, Jessop, we're hanging you out to dry.
805EE49E     //  Can you put the guy in Two in a cell and inform the commander?
BB25B9D4     //  Sure, Detective.
5A18C854     //  Got a message for you. Sighting of your disfigured hobo, on Grand between Temple and Sunset. And it looks like the 'bo has a record, too. He's wanted in connection with two female assaults.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
98829A5C     //  You ask me, he's guilty. You can never trust a sailor.
F2230B9C     //  We'll keep him in the tank. You do what you need to do.
0DC5E426     //  What now? Drive all the way to San Pedro and check his locker?
BAF3F1C9     //  Let's see if the bus story checks out.
33362651     //  There's a depot at 1660 Beverly Boulevard.
EF3C6619     //  Three suspects in the can and one on the hoof, and still no hard evidence on any of them.
9586B835     //  KGPL to car 11K, 11 King, come in.
FFAB08F5     //  11K, go ahead.
3F33B521     //  Patrolmen reporting Bobby Ross' card game breaking up at midnight.
DFA8751E     //  11K, roger that. Plenty of time to get Downtown, Cole.
4272961D     //  It's possible. Have them bring him in.
9E9C2219     //  KGPL, could we have Lars Taraldsen picked up?
1D6A3A7A     //  11K, roger.
9857F366     //  And thank you, ma'am. You have a safe trip, now.
57DBB5E7     //  Where are you boys headed today?
34093844     //  LAPD. 
53D5DAA8     //  We're after the driver of All American two four nine. 
68B5608F     //  Would have been around midnight onwards last night.
D2A58246     //  Just a minute.
E219F60B     //  Frank Zeferelli. He's your man.
8B8BB662     //  Where can we find him?
0094B5B0     //  Frank is out on the seven-four.
EDD5B936     //  Can you tell us the route?
11B54D75     //  Hang on. 
D65C05B7     //  I should have it mapped out here somewhere.
A344B4C3     //  We'll need to run the loop.
FF198591     //  We're not gonna drive the whole thing, are we?
CCE66F78     //  Won't take long. We have a siren.
7C7ECA90     //  If you'll excuse me, Detectives, I ought to get back to this.
C531BBE8     //  Look, I really don't know anything about your case or whatever this is about.
C0AA1BF7     //  There some kind of problem, buddy?
73AB9788     //  LAPD. We're investigating a murder. You had a sailor and a woman in a green dress on your bus late last night.
7486A61D     //  That's correct.
DBC22BA9     //  And the woman got off first? Around 2am?
95FDDBC8     //  Yeah, that's right. And the sailor stayed on all the way to Downtown.
1FB5A957     //  Can you tell us where you let the woman off?
6E4ABCA3     //  On California Street. 
05E1CF27     //  To tell you the truth she looked a little lost. 
5DDB11C1     //  Like she had got off on the wrong stop or something. 
2CEA651C     //  I didn't like dropping her off near that hobo camp.
3250601C     //  You've been a big help, Mr Zeferelli.
A5081D74     //  If I don't get back on this bus my passengers is gonna go berserk.
C0A17BD9     //  Listen, I get docked if I'm running late.
DF045DED     //  So Sailor Boy escapes by the seat of his bell-bottomed trousers. He left the broad alive.
EB585E7C     //  Left her by the hobo camp.
5E3C2EF3     //  Which means he's as good as killed her.
79F53434     //  We can't eliminate any of them. But the disfigured man should be our starting point.
B89BB4B9     //  I'm going to call for some backup. These 'bos hate cops.
F3711F82     //  Car 11K calling KGPL. Requesting backup on Grand, between Temple and Sunset. The hobo camp under the bridge. Possible suspect to be taken into custody. Code Two only, no sirens.
78C1B7C2     //  Roger, 11K.
052660FD     //  Six rounds won't get us far.
50419330     //  I need you to stay copacetic here, Phelps.
75C5E42E     //  LAPD. We'd like a word with you.
A78A745A     //  Save it for someone who's interested. 
EF137DF6     //  They're fascists come to move us on and steal what little we have left!
DC208631     //  We need to hold out until the cavalry arrives.
AC8FE802     //  How do we do that?
386A0556     //  Like this.
518870DE     //  Phelps, he's making a run for it!
7581D0BF     //  The skinny one is on the move. We can't lose him!
A6FC7771     //  Don't give them a chance to regroup!
48D6F6C6     //  Buck shot should keep ‘em down, Phelps!
E553B5B4     //  Get your filthy hands off of me, you bum.
D36D0381     //  You stinking Red.
92FBA471     //  This your socialist utopia, bud?
DBF21FF9     //  I hope you don’t need help with him, Phelps.
618BF992     //  You’re doing them a favor, partner.
7C848B7C     //  Let's give it to these lawless motherfuckers.
F88F66E6     //  Keep moving, Phelps. We need to clear this nest.
51D3938F     //  Let's get that disfigured son of a bitch and the rest of his acolytes, Phelps.
D483A397     //  You think they care about you? 
BDDFD9F3     //  We won their war and now they turn on us.
9674F754     //  If you want your rightful share we need to fight for it.
AC020F3F     //  You still got rights, don't you? You're still human beings?
C1B4A2CC     //  Tear them apart! 
90AEE2EB     //  Those assholes in charge, they forgot you. 
C4945F2F     //  Now you got their attention.
7FEBB325     //  Give it up, asshole!
FEEABDCE     //  Filthy son of a bitch! Stop right there!
3FB0108C     //  Your disciples know what you did last night?
8AB771D3     //  These men know they're harboring a murderer?
CE8375C6     //  Killing make you feel powerful?
57D75928     //  What's your name?
92A405B0     //  Comrade Stalin.
BD15EAE9     //  Very funny. We'll find out from your personal effects.
C4B6C5A8     //  Stuart Ackerman.
E59D6AFE     //  You're under suspicion for murder, Ackerman. We're taking you Downtown.
4D428040     //  You? You can't do anything more to me than what the Japanese have already done.
C3C72CB2     //  Shove your questions up your ass.
4AB0C7C9     //  Nothing you can do will make me talk.
7323C8C4     //  I didn't even feel that.
7455ABA5     //  Try again.
47F637D8     //  We'd better turn our musty red friend's shanty over. All of our evidence will be in there.
053AE9F2     //  Looks familiar. 
3908ABA3     //  Safe bet it'll match the mark under Theresa Taraldsen's chin.
EC59EBDC     //  Matches the green dress. The initials are damning.
47AC1A33     //  Ackerman doesn't look like much of a dancer.
B724DBD8     //  Alright, back to Central. Time to make our 'bo sing.
C6564F0D     //  The husband has an alibi but no real motive other than neglect. Jessop's alibi checks out. Bates is a recidivist. He'll be pulling the same shtick until we put him away for good. Ackerman has history, opportunity, hard evidence, but what motive?
76784618     //  We have the evidence. We know she was here. All we need is a confession and we can charge the bum with murder.
B228144C     //  He has a rather pungent reek about him. 
56D28D83     //  Get in there and liberate a confession from him.
6A662FCA     //  Ah, here they come. Fascists on the march.
E67D97BA     //  Ackerman, you were in the Marines.
CB4EB7FB     //  How do you know?
8E4A764C     //  The Corps selected big guys for flamethrower duty. That's how you got the burns.
4086584B     //  Life expectancy was five minutes for a guy on flamethrower detail. 
A08372CA     //  What kind of a government puts weight like that on a man's shoulders?
937B0AAC     //  You'll get no argument from me. It was a heavy load.
19D0D085     //  You feeling sorry for this smelly fuck?
11E93BFC     //  Where were you around 2am last night?
BA9F2BD6     //  At the camp.
23E84DA7     //  Can anyone vouch for that?
7FC1CC0D     //  Plenty of people. 
62D80A6D     //  See, there's a real community amongst the poor.
9308AA64     //  You have an alibi? Someone reliable. Someone who'll be around on the day of the trial.
DF407A1C     //  Fuck your trial. The capitalist system needs another victim from amongst the masses. So be it.
D1B16F67     //  You were up on the hill. You were seen during the day. We have a witness, we have evidence. Come clean with me, Ackerman, and I'll see what I can do for you.
248D9724     //  I despise your pity. 
C244161A     //  You have nothing that links me to this woman.
452521B5     //  You've got your orders. You're supposed to string me up because of who I am and what I represent.
623C6BEE     //  We have you cold, Ackerman. Her purse and the Ballroom ticket were in your lean-to. Tell us why you did it.
2B302B92     //  I kill because people need killing. 
5D69EA08     //  That's what I was trained to do.
ED067453     //  Why did you kill Mrs Taraldsen?
0697199F     //  I have no recollection of the people I have killed.
6FD5A2F0     //  You've made two previous attacks on women?
F9F322EF     //  I hate them. The way they look at me. 
AD69F510     //  The way they flinch at my touch. 
8BCD0901     //  I need them, yet I despise them.
3D656044     //  You hate women, Ackerman?
C396A7EE     //  More than you could ever imagine.
ED94F90D     //  How much did you hate Mrs Taraldsen?
82D19978     //  I ache to put my seed in them. 
A1B5C597     //  Afterwards, I have no use for them.
49EA6755     //  Are you denying that you strangled Mrs Taraldsen with a length of rope?
39D5DD8D     //  I'm not denying anything. You have to have proof, lackey.
6B8033FC     //  The system has crippled and blinded you, and you haven't even noticed.
5B029D48     //  We found a matching piece of rope in your lean-to. 
CE58D226     //  I think we'll find the blood will match, too.
CB285298     //  I own no property. How could it belong to me?
7F10EF0A     //  A bus driver dropped Mrs Taraldsen near your camp around 2am. Why did you take her up to the hill?
A880D029     //  Which hill? I have many places. I go where I please.
F3BDFEFF     //  Tell us that you killed Mrs Taraldsen, Ackerman. It's your only chance for help.
F0580D3F     //  Why would anyone help me?
6388B4A5     //  You are clearly insane, Ackerman. The State of California does not execute mental patients.
35CB1919     //  The Führer had the right idea there.
114663A9     //  I don't know the names of the women I have killed, but I have killed many of them. Their necks are so fragile.
4735FFED     //  You're lying, Ackerman. There must be a reason. You could have killed her in the camp.
9479110F     //  My reasons are my own. 
06AF0F5A     //  Can you disprove what I say?
1A3B2B7F     //  You do your worst. 
9D86041F     //  You're the willing tool of a despotic state designed to victimize the unfortunate.
9C83AD6F     //  The evidence is overwhelming, Ackerman. Give it up now - confess, and there's an outside chance we can save your life.
CE168E75     //  Your system already counts my life for nought. I don't need any help from you.
018E5DC6     //  We might not have enough to charge you right now, Ackerman. Until then you can cool your heels in a cell.
C03B05E2     //  I have to get back to my camp. People depend on me.
005C25C0     //  No more questions.
6955D17C     //  What are you staring at, boy?
8713E147     //  I thought you'd have more bullshit questions than that.
CBBD0B7C     //  The system can't break me and neither can your government. There will come a new day and we will remember the names of people like you.
585621DB     //  Stuart Ackerman, I am charging you with the murder of Theresa Taraldsen.
0F80B382     //  You ready? Let's get out to the scene.
01D3D2EC     //  With everything that's going on at that scene, I think we might have missed something. Let's turn back.
C855E9FC     //  Better talk to Mal, get his take on this one.
A8CEAD12     //  Looks like the evidence is close to pristine. See what you make of the place.
58AB8AEF     //  This lady might have seen something. Get her story.
A1B35351     //  I'd say call it in. R&I might have something could get us started.
71DE28F6     //  We've got bad news for one of the houses on that list, Phelps. No use delaying.
75ADDD40     //  How many left on the list? One of these places has to belong to our girl.
672A315F     //  Next address is the end of the line. Let's go there.
49D1EB32     //  We've still got the laundry label to check off.
C8134CD1     //  The laundry guy will have receipts, Phelps. He'll have records we can trace the stiff to. Let's get back there.
A41D757F     //  You remember that tag number? Ask the guy. See what he knows.
F2B7FDF7     //  What's the number? Our victim's there in the book. Look her up.
E6AE7B0B     //  We have a lead. Let's find out what the husband has to say for himself.
C15345AC     //  Why aren't we back at the house giving the husband hell? He's gotta be high on your list, Phelps. He's high on mine.
1BC1A643     //  Come on, Phelps. See who's home.
4ED8F2D2     //  You want my gut feeling? I'll tell you - this guy did it. Now we just gotta find some evidence.
E8469F73     //  Speak to the husband, Phelps. 
F1615FF6     //  Get straight to the point. 
C59CC5F0     //  I say we've got the bad guy right here.
AF6A7089     //  We could break the husband's story right now. Call in, get some uniforms dispatched to check out his alibi.
485A970C     //  Sounds like the Taraldsen broad had her last drink at Baron's Bar. We should check the place out.
6275FF8A     //  I like Baron's. Nice place, has atmosphere. And there is the booze. We should head back there.
0DFDCA96     //  What about the barman? We ought to get everything we can out of him.
489FDC76     //  We want to look for this Bates character.
1BEEA60D     //  Bates was with Theresa right before she bought it. Hit him with the questions, Phelps. Don't be gentle.
17404425     //  Call in that cab number, put out an APB. 
A41968E5     //  We'll have the whole force on this case.
3B7E2BCF     //  Maybe we should put an APB out on that sailor. Maybe we get lucky and a patrolman turns him up.
2CECE234     //  Theresa's trail leads right to this cabbie's back seat, Phelps. We need to find him.
25D5B73C     //  The cabbie was one of the last to see Theresa, Phelps. His statement could make the case. Let's get to it.
8C02BCCD     //  We've got Sailor Boy offering himself up on a plate back at Central. Let's go.
1C9170EB     //  Why aren't we in an interview kocking around that sailor? Come on, Phelps.
BA0BCEBB     //  It's open season on the sailor. Let's take a run at him.
14E4D4E8     //  Theresa definitely took the bus from the Crystal Ballroom. We need to find that bus. We need to check the bus depot.
79AF9018     //  You think we got everything at the bus depot? I say we go back and make sure.
FD29929D     //  Check the route map, Cole.
950E91BA     //  It's gonna be a pain in the ass to find him, but we need to talk to that bus driver. Let's roll.
33EF3CDD     //  This guy was the last guy to see Theresa before she died. We need to see what he has to say.
C646C242     //  Filthy goddamn vagrants. We get in, we find our man, and we get out again. That's the plan.
FC20AAF8     //  We have to go back to the hobo camp, don't we? We must have missed something.
BB821CBB     //  We're going after a tall guy with scars. Come on, Phelps. Let's get it over with.
1294A903     //  Look around. Find something solid - something that links the 'bo to the broad.
260FF74F     //  Let's finish this. Back to the station.
21D8626D     //  Central is our last stop. The evidence is airtight. We work through the interview and the hobo eats gas.
E1303B88     //  Come on. If Ackerman won't play ball, we'll rattle his teeth until he does.
35809C43     //  A man down on his luck I can abide,

4EFD3301     //  How about you nudge me?
D07AC39E     //  I think that's a job for your wife, Phelps.
DF1166FD     //  Oh, Rusty.
2FF584EC     //  How long is this bus route?
7544042B     //  It actually covers an area around the size of Central Division.
5159396B     //  The probability is we'll find it about half way around.

12BD20CF     //  Don't count on it.
D4719A01     //  No, no, no, you should've gone around the other way. We would have run into the bus by now if you'd gone the other way.
422D5EA2     //  How was I to know that at the time?
ED0F01F7     //  A good detective depends on his gut, and yours has just been found wanting.
F627D8A2     //  Well, your gut clearly wants for nothing, Rusty. Though from the look of it, its main request is beer.
AF70D58E     //  Beer and convictions, Phelps. Beer and convictions.
19E2D766     //  I think we ought to investigate the hobo lead.
1A392AF0     //  If you think we ought to, then I guess we ought.
A13F64C2     //  We're looking for a tall, disfigured man at the camp.
D221B427     //  Could be difficult. Most bums look deformed to me.
64424DF7     //  Come on, Rusty. This isn't Gothic fiction. Hobos are just like you or me. They're just men who've fallen on hard times.
B592545C     //  You ain't much of a detective, Phelps, if you think a hobo's like me. Clue number one: how do I smell?
F431FDBF     //  Of alcohol and stale sweat. You know, I may be onto something here.
C2368C32     //  Very funny, Phelps.
39975959     //  All American seven-four. Let's go get him.
E2ED20CC     //  Baron's Bar again. Someone must be real sweet on this dive.
20844CB6     //  That guy there will lead us up.
229C294C     //  I'm steeling myself for what I'm about to see.
1FB613EB     //  It'll just be another dead body, partner. Get used to seeing them. They're the gig when you're working Homicide, Phelps.
81628DB9     //  I've got a feeling we're about to meet another wife killer.
4209E4E0     //  You've always got that feeling, Rusty.
B71A29E8     //  Yeah, and it's usually correct.
26D1D017     //  Please, please, for once, can you not let your assumptions color your detective work?
6F48D38B     //  Just you wait. Nordic types show a particular disposition for this stuff.
7DB4441B     //  No message.
D037FCA2     //  Excuse me?
3A9B57FD     //  There was no message.
86B912CF     //  Where?
BE6CE560     //  On the vic. The last bodies had something written onto them. This one didn't.
403CFF3A     //  I'm failing to follow you.
B9C6550E     //  Can't be the same guy is what I'm saying, alright? Before you start trying to link this to Maldonado and all the others.
89683474     //  There are more factors to consider than the messages, Rusty.
8F01671C     //  This doesn't fit your pattern, Cole. End of conversation. Understand?
80D08544     //  This is a shot in the dark. How do we know someone even filled in a missing persons report for this dame?
08D29607     //  We don't, but it's the only thing we've got to go on.
D78CE9EE     //  Are you sure... you sure you searched the scene, Cole?
9705F343     //  I had a good look.
3A01FA7F     //  No, I mean really searched it.
00E67148     //  You were there too.
21E36658     //  Ah, Jesus. Come on, I thought you were the goody-two-shoes little prick 
2D3677BC     //  who went over crime scenes with a fine tooth comb. 
E1BE49E5     //  I thought I could relax in my old age here, Cole.
F2D4E5DC     //  The rain must have washed away the clues that would have led us to her identity.
A82F7F8C     //  I knew this weather was going to ruin my night.
DBADEE31     //  See what I mean? We'll be at this all night.
6EBF8FD9     //  There are only two more missing person leads on our list.
7CEE60A3     //  And they'll probably be as useless as the last guy.
BEC9D36B     //  But they're just as likely to be reports for that woman in the green dress.
522A60D7     //  No amount of wishful thinking's going to make me happy to be stuck in this car with you, Phelps.
78ADFAA1     //  Learn to love it, Galloway. I'm not going anywhere.
B83EC589     //  Another waste of time.
F7F4A45E     //  Eliminating false leads is an important aspect of police work. I'm surprised I need to tell you that.
F0578BAE     //  You wanna know what we did when it rained in the old days, Phelps?
C3F372FB     //  What?
AED2B732     //  We operated on the principle that all clues would be washed away. We grabbed someone close and we put the screws on until he pointed us in the right direction. That simple.
481EB00B     //  Why do I get the impression that you're just making this up?
A755066A     //  Garage on Seventh Street. Let's hit it, Phelps. The cab driver might tie this whole thing together.
6882F82F     //  You think he'll still be there?
C54C4CA5     //  In this weather? I doubt anyone would be champing at the bit to get back on the street.
F4D36993     //  I hope you're right.
106A40B9     //  The search continues.
839F85C0     //  He's moving.
F3334DBC     //  Why won't that little bastard stay still?
E9CA3BA0     //  There he goes again.
1D0A99B4     //  At least somebody's paying attention.
A7C88BD6     //  We'll narrow in on him eventually.
DBC7AAF9     //  One moment... we have three white females listed as missing, Detective. 
C1B9FF20     //  Myrtle Douglas, 294 Witmer Street. 
64390DA8     //  One Beatrix Rogers, of 1152 West Fourth Street. 
A893DDF6     //  And a Mrs Theresa Taraldsen, 43 Emerald Street.
8307B1B8     //  First the letter and now another body. Come on, you can't keep on telling me there's not a killer still out there.
38C4D8FA     //  You know, Phelps, all these arrests on your record are giving you a reputation. You don't want them turning into unsolveds.
C6969A61     //  Getting a vicious killer off the streets is more important than my reputation.
615D6DCA     //  Really?
E6F9FFB8     //  And besides, landing a big fat marlin is more impressive than an ocean full of minnows.
CF76130B     //  The minnows maketh the man, Phelps. You can't always hit home runs. Sometimes you just got to make first base.

83B5AFBB     //  Our Chief Chemist, Harold McLellan, was using this area to test the new process.
055389F9     //  And what exactly is this new process?
1B91E70D     //  That's classified information, son.
014F6CD6     //  We'll need a word. Has anyone accounted for him yet?
E8066D14     //  Not that I've heard, no, but... look around you, kid. You like his chances?
02A783AD     //  A lot of people died here, Mr Nicholson. I'm prepared to go to the press and tell them it was your fault. What is the new process?
9C8FF502     //  A way to chemically polish aluminum. It's traditionally done by hand. It's extremely labor intensive. The process could be worth millions.
CF1A7611     //  Tell us the truth, Mr Nicholson. You're making bombs for the military and this was some kind of an accident.
111F297F     //  Your pitch is high and wide, kid. We do plenty of work for the military and for aircraft manufacturers, but it's all polishing and plating. There are no bombs here.
AC797533     //  This was a very unfortunate accident. There's no need to be looking for conspiracies.
2739AC1F     //  What can you tell us about McLellan?
A75B2012     //  A brilliant chemist. He approached me a few months ago with the idea for the new process.
632B37C1     //  So no one has ever done this before?
73718094     //  No, but it is legitimate research.
A3EE3E95     //  Does McLellan have any friends in town, Mr Nicholson? Family that we could talk to?
DB792C87     //  He hadn't been in town long when we met, so no family. I don't think he had time for friends. He kept to his lab and his work.
4ED16156     //  So you thought McLellan could do what no one else could do? You were prepared to take that risk?
9FA31125     //  Look - he is a... was... 
3D33784D     //  a trained chemist, 
0B234A7B     //  and his ideas could revolutionize electroplating.

0F4701F0     //  If you want to keep making ridiculous allegations you can speak with my lawyer.
7424DB8F     //  Who is Tomoko Okamoto?
7D4AB020     //  Dr McLellan's personal assistant. She came highly recommended.
B987E984     //  By whom?
2FBC9A0E     //  By Dr McLellan. He insisted I hire her. I know what you're going to say. But you don't look a gift horse in the mouth, do you?
6F40FA5C     //  So you hire a chemical whiz kid and his assistant without checking either one of them out?
746CF7CC     //  Hindsight is a great thing, Detective. I should have looked more closely at their references.
C9E03E9A     //  Okamoto was involved in industrial espionage. Was she working for you or for a foreign government?
29295CEA     //  That's a ridiculous assertion. How can you possibly say she was a spy?
EC0D4A95     //  How many of your other employees carry spy cameras in their handbags?
87DEF901     //  Jesus, Mary and Joseph... she was selling me out.
F1D1BBB9     //  If she wasn't a foreign spy, who could she have been working for?
9695679D     //  Could be other plating companies, 
1AD671B5     //  but the big customers for the process are the aircraft manufacturers. 
21E5F210     //  Lockheed, Boeing, Hughes, North American...
B5E4D04D     //  I got enough problems today, son, without you slinging conspiracy theories at me. But foreign governments? Jesus Christ.

425281A6     //  We'll be in touch, Mr Nicholson. Can you send us Dr McLellan and Miss Okamoto's personnel files?
BCDCF647     //  I will if I can find them.
84A22D20     //  By the way, we also found the collar of a shirt. It has a laundry tag.

A9DDD351     //  Not yet. But I'm working on it.
B52CE900     //  Well, well. Why the cloak and dagger routine, Miss Okamoto?

C4CEA2B0     //  You need this scene secure. That's all I gotta know.
1D06161D     //  What do you need?
DAD33AC2     //  Phelps and Biggs, LAPD. We have one of your laundry tags. Can you tell us who it might belong to?
41F2135A     //  Are you kidding? I've got work to do, Mac. Here's the customer book. Knock yourself out.
BC0A5D51     //  Number was... J2620, Cole.
C9EBD02C     //  Thank you for all your help, sir.
65640E94     //  The number matches, but not with McLellan. Who is Hangstrom?
5013F2FF     //  Who is Hangstrom?
31535363     //  Could be someone else from the factory. Does he have an address?
81456AAB     //  No. Dead end.
D30721AF     //  Hey - you got the book. What more do you want?
AFDE9589     //  Come on, officers. I'm up to my neck in pants and shirts here.
E38FC731     //  Fine. Go. Not like you interrupted me or anything.
5E43ADA5     //  I need an address for an Oscar Hangstrom.
2CA37822     //  Checking... no residential listing for anyone by that name, Detective. Sorry.
3AFEA175     //  Car 14K, 14 King. 
D491D2A5     //  Meet the officer, a 187 at Beverly and Vermont. 
E4ADE1A1     //  Victim is a male Caucasian, identified as one Courtney Sheldon. 
4356AAE2     //  14K handle, Code Two.
567FEE82     //  Courtney Sheldon? Biggs - we need to get over there. Now.
7F57040F     //  That's Roy Earle's car.
AE0DF93F     //  I know.
8B09A905     //  Any messages for me?
55EFA1C3     //  Yes, Detective. Captain McKelty requests you check in at Hollywood Station immediately.
9AA44DB3     //  Hollywood? Why?
ABE63D23     //  A 187 call has just come in - victim a male Caucasian, Courtney Sheldon. They said you might have information relevant to the case.
4085768F     //  I'll go to the scene. Give me an address.
63F52546     //  Corner Beverly and Vermont, Detective. But there's no need, units have already been dispatched to...
D8F36139     //  Just tell the Captain we're attending.
E57EEC82     //  What have you got?
4632F96E     //  Looks like a drug overdose.
DB2D68DF     //  No goddamn way is this self administered.
8CD596C5     //  Kid's been pricked in the neck. You see there?
423BF4FA     //  Get away from him, Phelps. This is my case.
0DFA591D     //  Shut your fucking mouth. 
AE869868     //  Since when does a bag man work a case?
501F9122     //  I knew this creep was in on the morphine heist. A victim of his own product.
F12CBE40     //  Hey, Detective! Can we back it off a notch? 
772D8E37     //  This is getting out of hand.
638857BA     //  There's a time to talk and a time to shut up. 
724B634A     //  Now is the time to be quiet, son.
1BACA327     //  Courtney Sheldon was a corpsman, Roy. 
A8F23378     //  He served his country. 
05C208B5     //  He went out with a medical kit and an Army .45 into places that made the Valley of Death look like a picnic.
D5A361B1     //  You've finally lost it, partner.
A80B4B4E     //  I have a pretty good idea why Sheldon is dead, and I know about Monroe. Your vast corrupt future is draining away as we speak.
97BDAF02     //  I got better things to do than to argue the rub with you.
50AD4F8B     //  Stay with him until the coroner gets here. 
851F2DF8     //  Make sure Technical Services bags the evidence. 
7F4ADBB8     //  If you let this creep anywhere near it, I'll come looking for you.
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
619226D6     //  You know, Phelps - you're not the worst asshole going round.
5C15DE26     //  Thanks, Herschel.
8DB343B3     //  Get on with your case. I'm not going to fight you, Phelps.
67A8B372     //  You and Kelso keep running around in circles and we'll see where it gets you.
5903C792     //  I'll watch the bags right into the lab, Detective. Don't worry.
F0714075     //  The scene is safe with me.
E200CE2C     //  Whatever you want, I already told the other guy.
8E586D93     //  Detectives Phelps and Biggs.
3C468859     //  Look, I already told the patrolman. You got something new to ask?
9E219815     //  Did you see the guys who dumped the body?
CE7F6F65     //  Nope. Must have happened after hours, last night. I come in this morning, open up, go to take out the trash, and boom. There he is. I didn't see anything, I didn't hear anybody.
7916701E     //  Thanks for your help.
091341CF     //  I don't want anything to do with any of it, you hear? I found that joe and called the law. That's it.
FB282211     //  It's just my luck this guy ends up in one of my trash cans. I can't tell you anything about it, OK?
15B2436B     //  Are we gonna have this talk in installments or what?
B86D7EFA     //  Detective Phelps. Badge twelve-forty-seven. Messages please.
5C917C08     //  You need to call Ray Pinker urgently.
30D53CCE     //  Can you put me through?
3CDA419F     //  It's ringing now.
D8523DCC     //  We're on our way in.
7D3540DC     //  Nix that. I got a message from Lindbergh Field. An airplane tech there identified your part.
571E0DFC     //  What is it?
C2027F31     //  He said it was a prop spinner from either a Corsair or a B50.
B157E6CB     //  A what?
9969DDC8     //  Fits over the center of the propeller and protects the pitch gearing.
9607F536     //  So it's a military part?
C26E6C1D     //  Could be. 
8DF33BD8     //  But get this - the Spruce Goose runs eight Wasp R-4360's. 
81720DB5     //  I think you better get over there and check it out.
48D796B8     //  We're on it.
0BD086F2     //  Yes, Cole?
2F778A50     //  There's a 187 coming in. Courtney Sheldon. Can you look after it personally?
1AAF8505     //  Sure. I'll prep Mal as well.
CD33114B     //  Thanks, Ray.
ED7E1E66     //  Looks like Jack has lit a fire under these guys. They're cleaning the slate. They got Sheldon. Jack could be next.
2FB8905B     //  I don't know about you, Cole, but I get the feeling that Kelso is one of those touched-by-God sons of 
CF105CF5     //  bitches, who struts around the battlefield always putting themselves in danger and never comes away 
37C33E62     //  with as much as a scratch.
093EAD29     //  You could be right, Herschel. The man is cool under fire, I can tell you that much.
36B57E64     //  This is a military project, gentlemen. 
92302765     //  Can you state your business?
0D88670A     //  Detectives Phelps and Biggs, LAPD. 
B9B4220B     //  We're investigating the explosion. 
82DF9F07     //  We have reason to believe there may be a link to Hughes Aircraft.
811771E5     //  I'm sorry, I can't help you there, Detective. Without authorization from Military HQ, you won't be allowed onto this facility.
183D2D78     //  What seems to be the problem, gentlemen? 
01F1BFDD     //  Hey... Biggs! You're not still with the LAPD?
04F1BDA8     //  'Fraid so, Mapes. Can you help us out here?
5C4E3F71     //  Sure. What seems to be the problem?
B1D2B01A     //  We're working the big explosion at the electroplating plant. We found a part there that belongs to one of your planes.
28952309     //  I work Head of Security for Mr Hughes now.
5F0A0657     //  I'll take full responsibility.
5D2CAF01     //  I'm sure we can clear this up. Follow me. It's the big hangar - you can't miss it.
497C4822     //  So long as you stay with Mr Mapes, sir, you can enter.
CBF50043     //  Mr Mapes has security clearance. Go with him.
89639B19     //  Go right through. But stay with Mr Mapes.
5C6F7D20     //  Watch yourself inside, sir. Don't wander off.
187C6D3A     //  You heard the man. You can go.
314C5F60     //  You're cleared. For now.
5F7D1E62     //  What was that about?
05BA9B3D     //  Howard Hughes... that's what. The guy is totally untouchable.
E402746D     //  And Mapes?
9E26E43F     //  Vernon Mapes is a douche bag who used to work for Ad Vice. 
4C6DE460     //  Word is he runs fuck pads for Howard's starlets, pays them off with hush money when Hughes gets bored.
85BA01EF     //  Earle and Mapes would seem...
14044A92     //  Mapes was the role model for creeps like Earle.
3797942B     //  Follow me.
E767F983     //  Hey, I don't bite. Come on.
EDB1F414     //  Good day, Miss.
435C426C     //  Can that thing really fly?
D4401C47     //  Mr Hughes believes so. Amazing, isn't she?
67450509     //  So this is the Spruce Goose...
26D1E3F6     //  Jesus Christ, Biggs... you wanna get me fired? 
F86CD333     //  Mr Hughes hates that fucking name. 
B825A408     //  It's the H-4 Hercules to you.
F8720A4D     //  Do you mind answering a few questions, Mr Mapes?
76CE8194     //  Call me Vernon, kid. Fire away.
12A7D118     //  Do you know anything about the explosion that happened at Nicholson Electroplating this morning?
5DDFD4F6     //  No more than anyone else. Heard the boom while I was shaving. Almost shit my pants. Thought it was Pearl all over again.
BB483B59     //  But you have heard of the company?
045CE5FC     //  Sure. We're in manufacturing. We work with suppliers.
4E930A5A     //  But you had no personal contact with any of the employees and you have no idea what caused the explosion?
93E98804     //  I'm in security. I handle Mr Hughes' personal interests, if you get my meaning. I'm not directly involved in manufacturing.
78615715     //  Nicholson Electroplating was working on a miracle process to polish aluminum. A process that was very advantageous to airplane manufacturers. You're denying that you knew about it?
4E9C92C3     //  It doesn't matter what I deny, kid. It matters what you can prove. You have some evidence that links me personally with Nicholson?
D6816777     //  Nice try, kid. You have any real concerns you want to bring up?
467356D1     //  Do you know the chief chemist at Nicholson Electroplating? A Harold McLellan?
F29C518B     //  I've heard of the guy. He was pitching some fancy process to the company.
5B40594B     //  And were you interested?
CDA861A2     //  The slide rules and lab coats are always interested. If he could get it to work.
C5D6E037     //  Did Hughes have a contract with Nicholson?
EB3047CB     //  Hey, kid - lose the tone. Hughes has contracts with every plating shop in LA.
99C4CE5F     //  We'd like to discuss these contracts with Mr Hughes.
54705837     //  This kid is a riot, Biggs! See Howard Hughes? 
0A15331A     //  Harry Truman has to make an appointment to see Howard Hughes!
3F96FFB4     //  We know that you were sending parts to Nicholson for testing. Question is whether you were going through Nicholson, or cutting your own deal with McLellan.
986AA8B1     //  Interesting theory, kid. How you going to prove any of that?
9173A260     //  We found a prop spinner in the wreckage. We believe it belongs to this aircraft.
0DFAFDE1     //  We sent them some aluminum parts to test. Howard and the boffins were interested in this guy McLellan's theories. If McLellan was cutting out Nicholson that's not our problem.
20554FF9     //  I never had a little book like that in my day. I banked it all upstairs. I also avoided jumping to conclusions.
222A032D     //  Do you know Tomoko Okamoto?
0AAE38AA     //  Never heard of the broad. Why?
A0777804     //  Well, at the moment both Okamoto and McLellan are missing. Do you still carry a gun?
4B44439D     //  Sure. I have a permit.
14B38D82     //  You don't happen to wear an LAPD tie pin, do you, Mapes?
9D3B1DF1     //  Sometimes. I have a couple of them from my days on the force.
3AD3A4BC     //  Okamoto is an industrial spy. She's on your payroll.
0CC37F07     //  A spy, you say? That's very interesting. You have some way of proving she was working for me or Hughes?
741CC701     //  Intriguing case you have here, Biggs. Spies, explosions, Howard Hughes. You could make a movie out of this one.
6AA3C705     //  Thing of beauty, isn't she? Ah well. You probably got places to be.
CDA479FE     //  Any time you two want some night security work, just gimme a call.
6FCAF8B5     //  I did the same thing when I first saw the plane. I was staring wide-eyed for a full hour.
F55521ED     //  You need a drink or something, Detective?
5306E816     //  Wait a second. Didn't you want to talk?
B594CDEE     //  See, now you hurt my feelings. I've said all I'm gonna say.
B4DDCBAC     //  Thanks for your help, Mr Mapes. Do you mind if we have a look around while we are here?
D236AC4D     //  Sure. Knock yourself out.
C177E901     //  You want to take a look inside her? Can't hurt.
23C21604     //  Get a load of these engines. You think that cone could've come off one of them?
F774A75C     //  Looks like Mapes' office is in the far corner. Let's go see what he's hiding.
EA186E2A     //  That is Marie 'The Body' McDonald.
E1B2C1C3     //  Does Hughes have her on contract to RKO?
AAB2A283     //  Yeah, I bet he does.
6AC8A5EF     //  Is that a Pratt & Whitney 4360?
79B46871     //  Sure is. You know your motors.
D914CBEF     //  Do you mind if I take a look at the prop spinner?
603B4CC8     //  We're getting her ready for sea trials, so be quick about it.
384DC1C5     //  What is the oily covering on the metal?
A36A3E19     //  We coat the aluminum parts in linseed oil to preserve them from oxidization.
07CB9C55     //  McLellan's process was going to replace all this.
314800D3     //  You a flyboy during the war? I'll see you around.
DBBEBFE8     //  I could chat about this stuff all day, pal. But I got work needs doing.
28573C20     //  Suit yourself, if you're in a hurry.
280C0788     //  Great.
1B7A0540     //  Latitude 24 degrees, 15 minutes north. Longitude 76 degrees, zero minutes west.
E3D4A256     //  Don't you need coordinates or something for that thing, Cole? You're flying blind.
DE6EE7A4     //  Let's see where this is exactly.
378A7F04     //  The Bahamas. 
DA789139     //  Somebody's already got their maiden flight planned.
172B0F6B     //  24 degrees, 15 minutes north.
1CAC8C5D     //  76 degrees west.
2673F5AC     //  Thanks for the tour, Mapes.
C9C01724     //  Always happy to help the Department.
A076D2A2     //  Hey, don't I know your face from the papers?
4679804E     //  You're the cop who's shtupping that German broad!
A076D2A2     //  Hey, don't I know your face from the papers?
4679804E     //  You're the cop who's shtupping that German broad!
9250E01E     //  Nah. I think you got the wrong guy, Vernon.
95959282     //  So McLellan was selling his new process to Hughes, and cutting out Nicholson.
5F0D9816     //  Looks that way. But this would never go all the way up to Hughes. He would have middlemen dealing with stuff like this.
57F807D9     //  Someone like Mapes.
34EBC606     //  The word 'middleman' was invented for guys like Mapes.
29796F7B     //  Any messages for me, Hopkins?
4837A508     //  Not many you'd want to hear. Newspapers wanting interviews and rookies cussing you out, mostly.
3D9D9F54     //  Nothing else?
6007C2B9     //  Pinker wants you in Tech Services. Maybe you'll be more popular downstairs.
A419CE40     //  Pinker sounded pretty hepped up. You'd best go down.
23648B13     //  You seen the way people around here look at you, Phelps? I'd move along, if I were you.
374211CF     //  You want to run off and cry, Phelps, or do you want to get on with your job? Get back here.
E31310C6     //  What you want, a salute? Get lost.
1F2AEE54     //  I ain't assigned to your detail. Leave me alone.
112B4AB4     //  I don't want to be friends with a rat, mac. Leave me alone.
72884831     //  You're hanging on in this Department by a thread, buddy. Get away from me.
0EF060AB     //  Hey, Cole. You're not winning any popularity contests upstairs, you know?
0D0902A0     //  Where do you stand?
96FB0593     //  I think you're a good cop. But I try and stay out of politics.
09D8F6F9     //  Everybody tries to stay out of politics, Ray.
70E20E09     //  Well, don't quote me on it, but I'm hoping that Parker will get the job and clean this place up. I have your photographs.
FA7C2CA5     //  I've come to see the master criminal captured on film.
FC6C3A58     //  I think you're right, Ray. We have our man. You take a nice photo, Phelps.
9146CA48     //  Very funny.
1A1815E9     //  Was there anything we can use?
18E6882D     //  You be the judge.
D217F388     //  You can use the magnifier. There is quite a lot of detail.
4786AAFE     //  Howard Hughes - millionaire industrialist, aviator and playboy - and Vernon Mapes - ex-dirty cop and business fixer.
1919AF55     //  We found a similar tie pin along with a dead guy in a fridge.
32DE0783     //  The ring and the watch are a match for our John Doe. He's obviously the competitive bid. Can you get this over to Lockheed so we can get a name for this guy?
194274D0     //  It's already on its way.
0FE5ABF9     //  Excellent photography, Tomoko. So, Tomoko had the goods on McLellan. Too bad they blew the place to hell.
2CB40F76     //  Is this McLellan? 
C867134D     //  Can anyone make out the street number behind him?
D5F6FE90     //  Are you kidding? With my eyesight?
C0C44C39     //  This is the same house Mapes had in the photograph in his office.
CBF15DE3     //  Looks like you're not the only one with a bag of tricks, Ray.
80889D25     //  McLellan's patent application. So, we have McLellan raising a patent and selling to Hughes, and Okamoto copying the details for Lockheed. Where does that leave Nicholson?
A0666C37     //  With a great big hole in the ground.
F0C42B4F     //  Cole, can you help me with a little experiment?
2F5AF69E     //  Use the eyedropper in front of you. One drop from each of the bottles on the desk. Place the drops in the Petri dish.
37215E75     //  It's okay, guys. Just a little experiment.
78682088     //  Can you guys knock it off? 
DB865D2C     //  Everyone is still jumpy from that bang this morning.
CB33E3F5     //  Very funny, Ray. You just took a couple of years off my life expectancy.
B9720984     //  Did the same trick to me about an hour ago.
E30EA72D     //  So that was the stuff that caused the explosion?
39CF5DEA     //  I think so. Acetic anhydride is almost as explosive as nitro and when mixed with perchloric acid it's very unstable. It needs to be cooled constantly. We used linseed oil but you could add any organic compound to trigger an explosion.
78D20CC4     //  Three little drops...
E795A1DB     //  Yeah. And they were using a hundred gallon vat.
BCF8FAD3     //  You'd better go, Phelps, before Ray gets any more ideas.
1612E05C     //  Biggs, take the master criminal here and get moving.
B1939879     //  This place stinks of petroleum.
1D3C1ABF     //  Avgas, if I'm not mistaken. It's all around the floor.
3F31FDD9     //  Hangstrom and McLellan are the same man.
198FA67B     //  Hangstrom is flying today on TWA.
99ADC3B8     //  Hangstrom is dead, Cole. Why leave your ticket behind?
D3BBF420     //  Mapes is cleaning up.
250369D6     //  The gas, Cole, the gas! We gotta get outta here, right now!
14B90E7F     //  Look, by the stove! Shoot the gas line, Cole! We're outta here!
E1D577C7     //  Over here! The window! Get out of there!
B861D809     //  Fuck.
1EF69CA5     //  There you are, shitheel. Come on! He's not getting away from us.
5EF80EA7     //  Shit. Hughes' security men, Cole. Stay on Mapes. Knock them off the road if you have to, but stay on that fucker.
0DC47C5D     //  Let's see you run now, Vernon. Time to clean Vernon off the slate.
3643576B     //  We're gonna have to go through all of the security men first. I hope you're ready for a fight, Cole.
52306D03     //  He wants to play cat and mouse, fine. Let's go and get his ass.
797F0ADB     //  Alright then. Let's see if those clean, sparkly badges of yours can stop a fucking bullet. Come and get me!
D88EF178     //  Jesus! What're we supposed to do now, Cole? That's fucking no man's land out there.
4262F22E     //  I need to get close enough for a shot. Herschel, can you cover me?

BA6F4532     //  Check Mapes' office. But easy does it. You find something, he could turn nasty pretty quick.

616078EE     //  The guy had good, honest cops hanging their heads in shame.

4B3384E6     //  Always the politician.
C2BF8AB6     //  It's not political, it's practical. Maybe the men combing Hollywood Boulevard after the Elizabeth Short murder were more interested in sniffing out booze than the clues that would've led to her killer.

5583FA63     //  Fine by me.
0E93A7EE     //  So, it ain't the Werewolf killer after all. Good to see you've come to your senses, Cole.
C168EBA0     //  I always said work the evidence. I only stipulated a connection to the BD killer as an avenue of investigation we should leave open. And as far as I'm concerned, it still is.
A0ACD7E5     //  How'd you like losing your cherry, rookie?

796A5CE0     //  We will all miss Floyd and the steely edge he brought to his police work. 
C39BDB94     //  The Department has arranged a wee drink at the Galway Arms 
96CED635     //  to quench the mighty thirst a man gets 
5EAC0812     //  from 25 years of police work.
8B38E350     //  Floyd's departure leaves a place at the top table and the Chief has seen fit to promote Cole Phelps from Burglary to the Homicide Desk. Stand up, Phelps. Take a cheer.
365B2883     //  You're in the major leagues now, sonny. Rusty Galloway, a fine lawman of the old school, will be taking you under his wing.
A01EF8DB     //  Your first case is the murder of a woman, found last night and bearing all the signs of The Werewolf. Get out to the scene, lads.
890966E8     //  Come on, Phelps. Let's get moving.
F2E36FC8     //  Do you have the address?
7526BF47     //  It's been all over KGPL. It's off Temple Street, between Belmont and Glendale.
0B3D1B11     //  What happened to Rose?
AEB1A5BC     //  Parker wants the Chief's job. Word is it's either gonna be him or Thad Green, so they're both clearing the decks.
C0BFEA02     //  So where does that leave you, Galloway?
88E4A41E     //  It leaves me saddled with a chump

96EE59AB     //  I didn't ask for you and I don't want you. 
0758016B     //  So keep it to yourself.

056453A1     //  What did he mean by The Werewolf?
5FECCD68     //  The Dahlia. 
506D4EAA     //  The Daily News came out calling him The Werewolf 
124819E6     //  Killer, the Examiner came up with The Black Dahlia.
C57AE8B9     //  We any closer to catching him?

F43F86F8     //  Why so many women this year?
FD838B89     //  'Cause of the war. You should know that. 
2E570EE3     //  Guy gets to kill people every day in combat, comes

BBFB53ED     //  It's that simple?
1950ED5D     //  Like I said - most of the time it is.
D073AF4B     //  How about a scoop for the Examiner, Galloway? You could use some good press.
ED2A323E     //  Another tramp, another message. Is The Werewolf back in business, boys?
10EDDA01     //  Do you have a mother, asshole? A sister? How about showing some respect for this poor woman? Let us do our job and Detective Galloway will give you a statement later.

5B7A30C7     //  That's Phelps, guys. The war hero. Defending the honor of murdered humps.
39708F99     //  Get used to it, Phelps.

A4E82EEF     //  you got your headlines.

DC4592A6     //  I want answers not questions, buddy.
1FFFE0D7     //  Go do your job, Detective.
F40E43CB     //  Your job ain't to harass the press, Phelps.
72DB9205     //  I'm just here to report the facts.
4BD92FE6     //  Detective?
4C2E2FFC     //  Patrolman, this your beat?
06903330     //  Yes, sir. Well, part of it. Kids park here, they use it like a lover's lane. It's a working neighborhood. Some trouble, but nothing like this. It's known locally as The Moors.
4EA7D7E8     //  You were first on the scene?
CDAF8977     //  Yes, Detective.
28AC7EC8     //  No one's disturbed the body?
905B8237     //  No, sir. We cleared out them vulture reporters so Pinker and the coroner could work. They're waiting to talk to you.
A85C339C     //  What can you tell me about the shoe prints?
EA3C8D62     //  Men's size eights. Pinker lifted impressions for me to compare back at the lab.
E1FFF1E9     //  What caused the blunt force injury to the face?
F3A49AD6     //  Could be anything from a baseball bat to a lug wrench. I'll have more details after the autopsy.
2A16C3D6     //  Cause of death?
5156DEA8     //  Could be the head injuries. She has been badly stomped, the cuts look superficial. I'll know for sure in an hour.
40541446     //  What about this wound on the finger?
693E6D73     //  Something removed, a ring most likely. I assume it was taken postmortem.
4E9567F1     //  The Dahlia?
9F7215B8     //  For my money, a copycat.
DC1738F2     //  We can't rule it out. We need to work the evidence.
5EDD06F9     //  We've been doing that for six months and we got nix.
81539185     //  What do you think?
907827F4     //  There's only three causes for murder, pin-up boy: money, power and passion. This guy likes his work and he likes to advertise, so that rules out the first two.
224C10F3     //  I need to get back to it, Phelps.
FD9F4EDD     //  Can we discuss this later?
48079666     //  This is your first homicide. You need to listen.
BDBFF96E     //  What does the writing on the victim mean?
A82F2D0B     //  BD, Black Dahlia. Tex? Your guess is as 
C687B2F2     //  good as mine. 
B4989E9C     //  Could be something to it, or could be the killer's 
E1AC7FBA     //  trying to throw you off the scent. 
0714D4B0     //  Either way, I'll run tests on the lipstick.
71655C10     //  Any idea of the time of death?
3CEC2DB6     //  From the temperature I'd say after midnight. I'll confirm with you later.
D86CE586     //  You need to look the body over, Phelps. Then I'll talk you through it.
DBEF0477     //  I'll leave the theorizing until after you've examined her for yourself.
5338BA9A     //  I should get back to my beat, Detective.
2DCB0989     //  You think it's The Werewolf done this?
12EA56CE     //  Hey, are we done here?
21C7B3DC     //  This equipment is valuable, and so is my time. Leave me alone.
BD79272E     //  Outta the way. This report doesn't need a dozen pictures of your pinstriped ass.
F3ECADC3     //  Go house to house and see what you come up with.
AD8C3754     //  You got it.
ED2E8588     //  Carruthers.
7AA9D9DD     //  Phelps. You make Homicide?
BA5AD71C     //  Looks like it. Galloway has been making me feel welcome.
8BF3875E     //  I'll bet he has.
DA8E0A23     //  Has the scene been secured?
3B72EF50     //  Patrolman Houlihan saw to it. The victim's personal effects are still where they fell.
C4355E9C     //  We can rule out robbery as a motive.
8A9FCF83     //  The victim's bag.
F849288B     //  Looks brand new. Can't be the one used on the body.
BAFF901A     //  Looks like some kind of puzzle or parlor game.
B36202A4     //  The Bamba Club. Why steal a table lighter?
D1E2D717     //  The killer reverses his vehicle up here, dumps the body, and then leaves in a hurry.
41E4C4BF     //  Broad had big feet.
6AA0072F     //  Don't get on your high horse. It's just an observation.
D06E1B1B     //  Phelps - get back here and give this crime scene a proper going over.
45B9DC35     //  We've got enough leads to be getting on with. Let's go.
2F37F00F     //  Nine times out of ten in a domestic it's the husband. The husband, however, would have beat her brains out in the comfort of the family home. I think the display angle will rule him out.
99DC3357     //  We need to question him regardless.
4D7B818B     //  Agreed. I'm just telling you how it will play.
AF09C386     //  Crime scene is just up the dirt road, Detective.
DC7E10AF     //  Don't sweat it. I'm keeping the riff raff out.
A4A0C21C     //  Top of the hill is where they need you, Detective.
BC54FBFA     //  Soon as the Captain gives the word, I'm supposed to move those reporters on.
6C6FBF08     //  I'll try the back door. Wait here a second.
B72037F5     //  Side window's been jimmied. Looks like somebody's creeped the joint.
C62FBF4B     //  Tiffany. The rest of this stuff is junk. Might explain the missing ring.
02EF033C     //  A regular Amelia Earhart in her day. The ring looks distinctive.
B589B645     //  Burglar used a pry bar. Why did you kick the door in?
B540A163     //  If you think I'm gonna climb through a broken window in a thirty dollar suit you've got another thing coming, buster.
9C273B82     //  Burglar used a crow bar.
27359BC0     //  Let's scope the rest of the joint and move on. It must be eleven and I'm feeling parched.
993E5306     //  Celine and Jacob are obviously having problems. It speaks to motive.
8163422A     //  Crime scene evidence still weighs against it being the husband but Jacob could give us something to go on.
C285674A     //  If one of my ex's drank like this, she'd be feeling the back of my hand.
D3B5E039     //  Let's see what Jacob has to say for himself.
D1DA2406     //  Call in Burglary and get Technical Services out here. I'll talk to the neighbors.
92083FF4     //  Don't take all day about it, Phelps. I get nasty when I'm thirsty.
F1AB98EF     //  Galloway. Homicide, badge number five-sixty-four. Requesting Technical Services for a suspected 459 at 142 North Union.

1BC6133C     //  Our children grew up together. 
CDA221D9     //  What's going on, Officer?
2CF9B065     //  Did you see Mrs Henry go out last night?
7C7B6FFF     //  Well, I'm no busybody you understand, but... 
913C7944     //  Celine had been drinking, and she and poor, long- suffering Jacob had a terrible row. 
9D5B7BFF     //  I think Jacob may have given her a black eye. 
03C27AD0     //  He stormed out and she went back inside.
9BFE33D3     //  Did he come back?
509EE9E8     //  No. Celine was listening to music and shouting until she left, around 10pm. 
04099AAB     //  She was very drunk to have been driving. 
0BFBB6A5     //  But she's not the sort of person you can stop from doing something when her dander is up. 
6B71C3CF     //  What is this about, Officer? Is Celine alright?
CFF7A69A     //  I'm afraid Mrs Henry has been murdered, ma'am.
237BADD8     //  Murdered? Oh my God. 
D1DAE79C     //  I'm afraid I need to go and sit down.
C4D09EA2     //  Just... just give me some time to myself. Please.
E399387B     //  Please. I'm too upset.
2FA1A215     //  No, Officer! Come back. I have more.
7C5D2945     //  Jacob Henry had a violent argument with his wife last night. He is looking more and more likely.
75250CA8     //  For my money, the broad keeps the house looking like that she probably deserved it. The Skipper wants us to bring him in. Keep the hacks off our backs for a while.
1E08716E     //  Okay, Phelps - we go in hard. You follow my lead.
56499A6D     //  You Jacob Henry?
68A98AED     //  Yeah. Who's asking?

A4190244     //  Murder? Celine?
E08EB9B0     //  Oh my God...
7043188D     //  Save the dramatics for RKO, pal. You've got bigger problems.
0EFBAD38     //  What the hell are you talking about?

4AB507BC     //  that she's...
63937F8B     //  Jesus, I'm sorry...
587B39E8     //  Take a seat, Mr Henry.
F2721B99     //  We're going to have a look around, then we'll talk.
C90D27D5     //  Kill my own wife?
BE5890F5     //  She was a lush, and a tramp. And you just couldn't stand it anymore.
FE78243E     //  Shut your goddamn mouth!
1ADD6082     //  So now you're going to tell me you loved her? The DA goes all gooey over remorse, Jacob...
6D4BA80F     //  Jesus, Phelps! Gimme a hand with this.
9E899E84     //  I've got nothing to say to you bastards.
8888ECAF     //  Go to hell.
05C0743A     //  That's all? If you've got more in that goddamn book, spit it out.
0A7224C0     //  You're just gonna go on talking this same ridiculous story, aren't you? You know what? You can go to hell.
CEACC847     //  Call it in and get a squad car dispatched. 
86F258F7     //  And check for messages. 
D28F269D     //  I'll keep old slugger here company.
F2B15D19     //  Carruthers said she took a real pounding.
B9C7DA02     //  Maybe if he'd been a little firmer in the beginning he wouldn't be in this situation now.
AAC6E4C5     //  I imagine that Neanderthal routine is a big hit with the ladies, Galloway.

DACC7C10     //  Certainly, Detective.
8B09A905     //  Any messages for me?
A86EFBC9     //  Yes, Detective. In regards to the Celine Henry homicide, 
B3C8B1BD     //  the owner of the Turkey Bowl Restaurant at 1535 West Third Street 
C64C8407     //  says the victim was at his restaurant last night.
CE9851DC     //  Turkey Bowl Restaurant. We'll check it out.
77591D38     //  You have a message from the coroner. Do you wish to be put through?
53E448BA     //  Yes, ma'am.
ED2E8588     //  Carruthers.
55F3E5CD     //  It's Phelps.
AD6C04ED     //  I've completed the autopsy. Several wounds to the head from a blunt metal instrument. Closest match would be a socket wrench handle.
8D254535     //  So the cause of death was the blunt...
54F81050     //  No. The blows to the head, surprisingly, were not fatal. Death was from hemorrhage, and shock from the fractured ribs and multiple injuries caused by the stomping.
56C6D197     //  Anything else?
60ED477F     //  He's some kind of sex fiend. The tissues of the anus were bruised about one-eighth of an inch, but no trace of semen in the anus, vagina or stomach.
8C667801     //  Thanks, Doc.
D979DA44     //  Any other messages?
B1B9DB19     //  One, Detective. From Captain Donelly. He wants any and all suspects returned to Central. Interviews to be set up immediately.

1CDCA508     //  Size elevens.
71A1FA26     //  Seems like Jacob was looking for a solution to his problem.
7B06D965     //  Why did you kill her, Jacob? Things will go better if you come clean about it.
51D51B04     //  That's a lousy thing to say. I never gave up on my wife.
1442CA86     //  You were separated from your wife. You argued...
18CB911C     //  She wanted things I couldn't provide. 
F68E22C3     //  Fact is, she was disappointed with life.
405E3717     //  You went to her house. You fought. You beat her. She left, and then you followed her...
3FB13770     //  I left first. She tried to batter me with a frying pan. I had to slap her down.
4DBABF6A     //  Understandable.
D69CE081     //  I don't believe you, Jacob. I think you didn't have the guts to do it yourself so you had someone else do it.
73C1FF45     //  You want to back that up with something, big mouth?
E70CD424     //  I've had just about enough of you.
00F30A5D     //  The note by the phone suggests you meant her harm.
2775FD49     //  You want the truth? Truth is I was sick to death of her. I was trying to have her committed.
FC46DD7C     //  Can we get to the Bamba? A man could die of thirst on a case like this.
0C9A181D     //  The Turkey Bowl or the Bamba Club. I know what's got my vote.
C2DF1221     //  Phelps and Galloway, LAPD. Were you working here last night?
D8FD6A8E     //  Yes. How can I help, Officer?
D7A4262B     //  You can start with your name.
AD2881C6     //  Garrett Mason.
B4C395B6     //  You're the regular bartender on nights?
48983A66     //  I'm a temporary barman. I work for an agency. I fill in at bars across town.
A7617AA2     //  Do you remember a woman who came in here last night? Five feet seven, about 110 pounds, blonde hair. About forty years of age...
7487A0A2     //  You mean Celine Henry?
F5BEBC2D     //  Yes. Do you know anything about her?
D94013F5     //  I don't but the owner, Mr McColl, serves her most nights. Would you like to speak to him?
DDD42D0A     //  I would.
A64F7EC0     //  He sits at the back of the club. Wears a hibiscus - you can't miss him. Is there anything else?
6F5A0935     //  Inquire away, Phelps. I'll stay here. I'm a little parched. Pour me three fingers of rye.
9E00ECE7     //  You going to pay for that?
6F55D0CD     //  ...
CD9DB716     //  On the house, Officer.
80455706     //  That's the spirit. Pour me another.
53E0543F     //  I don't mean to be rude, but I've got work to do.
E24BFB6C     //  Unless you'd like a drink too, Officer, there's not a lot I can do for you.
41EB3745     //  Hold on. Weren't you about to say something?
AC9FA997     //  I can check your coat or book you a table. Maybe you want to talk to the owner, mister. He's in the back somewhere.
7F56A2A0     //  I started my shift twenty minutes ago. You're better off talking to the bartender.
9CF42EC6     //  Detective Phelps, LAPD. Mind if I have a word, sir?
3A439C02     //  Name's Dick McColl, son, I own the place. What seems to be the problem?
5E6D4533     //  Did you have a woman in here last night - five feet seven, 110 pounds, blonde hair, mid forties?
32DC8F52     //  Celine Henry, sure. She's a regular. She and I and Jacob - her husband - we go way back. Why?
0EF8ADD2     //  We're investigating her murder.

10DD7269     //  - her husband - we go way back.
4FE07E6E     //  She was here last night?
68AC14A0     //  Sure, she's a regular. Celine is... was... a lovely woman.
352A0E63     //  Was Mrs Henry here with anyone last night?
E9B5A771     //  Not at first. Celine already had quite a head start.
F144A575     //  But she attracted attention?
334D3E13     //  Certainly. A few gentlemen became very enamored with her and her stories. One guy in particular.
A5426A80     //  You know him?
7D333F17     //  No. He's been in a couple of times.
88F643EC     //  Did they leave together?
CADE44EA     //  Yes. At around eleven... if it helps I made the guy's license plate.
03847623     //  How about a name? This is a murder beef, McColl. You don't want any adverse publicity for this place, do you?
60E63E06     //  If I had names I would give them to you. I liked Celine. I'd like to see you get whoever did this. Are we clear on that?
A3915F77     //  You say you liked Celine, McColl. How much did you like her? You two cozy up when she was drunk?
66AF883A     //  You're trying to lay this on me? I hope you've got more than just hot air to back that up, wise guy.
BF0BACCA     //  Celine was a funny lady. There was a lot to like about her but she drank way too much. I kept an eye on her because I liked her and because I felt sorry for her husband. You got a problem with that?
63AEBD95     //  I think this could be a great help, sir. Thank you.
3E124A44     //  You know the husband?
51606639     //  Sure, I know Jacob. He was in the Corps. He met Celine on a furlough and married her when the war was finished. He put up with a load of shit.
9BC76A24     //  Do you think he killed his wife?
97418E5C     //  No. No, not in my opinion.
3DF4B23C     //  Mrs Henry appeared to be missing a ring, torn from her finger. But not her wedding finger.
5B3819E5     //  Celine always wore a red garnet ring. On the large side. Larger than life, like Celine herself.
D326ECC4     //  Did she have it a long time?
CADC4F15     //  Sure. Since way back in her flying days.
99B87CBE     //  Did her husband buy it for her?
7D633361     //  No, it was before Jacob.
639197B0     //  Was it valuable? Could it be motive for her murder?
092473B4     //  Who could say, these days? 
FF503CF7     //  I think it had more sentimental than monetary value.
471E3FC3     //  I think you know where the ring came from and I think you're going to tell me.
0DE4ACF0     //  Okay... I bought it. Years ago. 
318A3F2C     //  I carried a torch for Celine in those days. 
FF538408     //  Guess I always have. 
F6ABAAD1     //  Her old man never knew about it.
BD42FA3B     //  I think you killed her, McColl. 
DB456FCD     //  She finally dumped Henry but still she wasn't interested in you. 
D9E42507     //  She was in here flirting and that was it for you. 
1BA8E6E7     //  You took the ring because it has some link to you.
FE6D8662     //  You're full of cheap shots, aren't you, Detective?
02505598     //  Speak to the temp barman. 
B4843E0D     //  I was here for a couple of hours after I closed up and my wife will testify that I was in all night. 
F1B8507E     //  I think I've had enough of you and your theories.
82D38A95     //  Was he ever violent with her?
EDDE5D87     //  Celine came in here last night looking like she'd taken a slap. They don't live together anymore, so it might not have been him.
52CD136D     //  So if it wasn't Jacob, then you probably let her out of here with the guy who killed her. How do you feel about that?
0D34FAE5     //  Stow the attitude, will ya? I tried to get onto Jacob. I rang him up, asked him to come pick her up like usual but he refused. She picked some night to push him over the edge. I rang him back around 11:30 but I got no answer.
F3D6393F     //  You're lying, McColl. You're covering for Henry. You called him and told him what time she was leaving.
46045AF2     //  You're an asshole. You know that?
9B2DB1A2     //  Where do you get off, pal? I feel bad enough about what happened to Celine without you slinging mud.
90F9E11C     //  I better get back to sorting out the pay packets.
EE2975FB     //  I've been helpful, but now it's time to let me get on with running my business.
7A781ED1     //  Come on, Detective. I was talking.
B8630AFC     //  So... we done?
B52565E6     //  If you're waiting for a free drink, it ain't coming.
1CCA5CAD     //  I want the guy who hurt Celine found, and you don't have the first idea what you're doing.
22572C4B     //  Look, 142 North Union Avenue, Jacob and Celine's place. You want to know how things were at home, that's the place to start.
F4DE8F23     //  Thanks, Mr McColl. You've been a big help. One more thing - would you have an address for Celine?
E31992D7     //  142 North Union Avenue. God knows I had to send her home in enough cabs to remember that.
1D045220     //  McColl, you said you liked her, and yet you've been no help at all. I want Celine's address.
A078D48D     //  142 North Union. Now get the hell out of my bar.
3F6B2A54     //  You should check in with R&I, put an APB out on that plate.
2BA36577     //  We could wait for information on the plate or visit the Turkey Bowl. Or we could head back to the station and slap Jacob around again.
3372DAEE     //  Let's get out of here.
E2036DF3     //  Hey, what's the hurry? My stool was just starting to warm up nicely.
90B9A878     //  I need a registered owner on a license 
57207152     //  plate two-boy-eight-eight-nine-nine.
4E8A6F78     //  Yes, Detective. I'll need to contact the DMV. 
B22A27E5     //  Shall I relay the details via KGPL?
BC6631EE     //  Please.
8B09A905     //  Any messages for me?
F8559DAB     //  LAPD. Phelps and Galloway. We're working a murder case. Mrs Celine Henry. You called in?
71B714C6     //  Yeah. The name's Joe Nesco. This is my place.
BF1456B9     //  You saw Mrs Henry in here last night?
2A52CA6B     //  Until about 1am, having dinner with a friend.
EE55A35A     //  Doing more drinking than eating?
AE7E9EF7     //  You got that straight.
37F92721     //  Mrs Henry was seen leaving another establishment in the company of a man. Did the two of them come here?
CB093C86     //  Yeah. I remember seeing her with a guy.
14955135     //  Had you ever seen that man before, Mr Nesco?
1C4658E8     //  Couple times, maybe. You know how it is - a lot of different faces go through an all night place like this.
F7CF681D     //  You have a name? Description, maybe? 
10F76AF0     //  Come on, Mr Nesco. We need something more to go on.
FF0F886E     //  Smallish guy, maybe five seven. Dark complexion. Latin looking.
15913B68     //  Don't lie to me. You want to be up for obstructing justice?
22A296F0     //  Smart mouthed son of a bitch, coming in here threatening me. What you got, you want to talk to me like that?
E1D74DB4     //  I called the cops because I was doing my duty and I felt sorry for that poor woman. Not to be abused by you.
5C5BEBD5     //  What time did the two of them leave?
86AAE346     //  Around 2am. They were talking pretty loud. She had a black eye - said her husband gave it to her. Said she was gonna have him committed.
5F059EBC     //  Did you see them leave?
D74053DC     //  They got into his old Pontiac. 
F8005847     //  Dull brown color. 
DF50ABD6     //  I got a look at the license plate. 2B8899.
50C58EFF     //  Was she a regular in here?
7C56CC70     //  No. I mean, I wouldn't have recognized her face among the usual crowd.
C8E78009     //  Would you be able to identify the man she was with?
056CB178     //  Maybe. I wasn't watching him too close.
8FF4F581     //  Was the place busy last night?
3304F3EC     //  Sure was.
12ED9CEE     //  So how come you paid so much attention to her?
F439B249     //  She had something... for an older broad, I mean. Not good looking but vivacious, full of life. I've always found that kind good in the sack. I was thinking about trying my luck but that guy she was with had her wrapped up tight.
0A79290F     //  You're lying. He's a regular. At 1am in the morning you bring people to places you know.
846C640F     //  I've seen him around but I don't know his name.
E85049A1     //  You should try a more humble tone, Detective. You might find people more helpful.
6B9226AA     //  We'll be in touch, Mr Nesco. Thanks for your time.
DEBC17E7     //  Why'd you call us down here, Nesco, if you were going to clam up and waste our time? You won't find many cops eating down here once the word goes out.
81B6FAB8     //  Hey, I got a diner to run here.
A58C2EF7     //  Haven't I given you enough already?
0D180A3D     //  I called because I got something might help. Now you don't want to listen?
CD2BC2A5     //  You can't stand around here all day. You'll be bad for business.
CBE68FBA     //  You must have something to go on.
0A4766D8     //  I called up because I thought I could help. Dunno why I even bothered now. Take a hike, pal.
297DDEE8     //  Where the hell is he going with that?
79CE877C     //  Look, pops - just hand over the money, okay?
BDA34B94     //  Alright, young fella, okay. Hold your horses. I'm getting the money.
E48BA18B     //  I ain't afraid to drill you, you know?
DEE552F6     //  Hey - careful with that trigger finger now. You look the nervous type.
F49C2DA4     //  Plug the old bastard, Lefty!
C5B13633     //  If I gotta come in there I'm spraying lead, you old coot!
7127BDDF     //  LAPD! Drop the weapon!
267EF366     //  Jesus, watch your shots, Cole! You hit that bowser, we all go boom.
12953DBA     //  Lefty! Gonna need an extra gun out here!
6491F25F     //  One of those Army .45s, huh? You're handy with that thing, Phelps.
96F46CEB     //  Car 11K, car 11 King. Come in.
FFAB08F5     //  11K, go ahead.
0D0D4BB6     //  License plate 2-Boy-8-8-9-9 belonging to a brown 1936 Pontiac. 
28C44E12     //  Registered to an Alonzo Mendez, apartment sixteen, 402 South Fremont Street.
22825B2A     //  Any word on an owner for that vehicle? License was two-boy-eight-eight-nine-nine.
667F2BD2     //  Yes, Detective. The plate belongs to a brown 1936 Pontiac. Registered owner is one Alonzo Mendez, of 402 South Fremont Street, apartment sixteen.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
42EB45DE     //  I had plenty of guns shoved under my nose in my time. Still, I appreciate the help.
214C9AD2     //  Don't you worry, Officer. Takes more than punks like that to rattle me. You can get going.
A056C7F7     //  Mendez could be our man.
81470984     //  He could be at that, but you don't want to cross the Skipper, Phelps. Not a great move on your first day. He wants Henry re-interviewed.
A0A0DF42     //  We have a firm lead, Captain.
2AA46092     //  Are you questioning my judgment, Cole Phelps?
67D03160     //  No, sir.
7F34381B     //  Good. I thought not. 
7D20977B     //  Jacob Henry is a sob sister, pushed around by his wife. 
63BF4C2E     //  I think with the right kind of persuasion he might be prepared to seek absolution. 
A29CBFA9     //  Are you prepared to show him the error of his ways, young Phelps?
841AEEA3     //  I don't think he is our man. 
A75F5D98     //  Galloway agrees with me.
C2D7C4DE     //  Don't drag me into this.
18F0657D     //  Rusty is a practical policeman. 
5270D256     //  A bird in hand is always worth two in the bush. 
0CC5262C     //  Let's liberate a confession from poor Jacob and the public will sleep easier tonight. 
82BB558A     //  Run along now, Phelps. 
B104ECF2     //  I've warmed him up nicely for you.
680AD4F7     //  When I set a man a task I expect him to fulfill it. Pronto.
F0D1E493     //  Henry's confession, Phelps. Get it. Ease his troubled mind.
1D37B73D     //  I don't recall dismissing you, Phelps.
8487D783     //  I'm just here in case the guy decides to kick up a fuss.
125BD82E     //  He's kept his mouth shut since we put him in there. Sorry.
A013CC69     //  Doesn't look good, Jacob. You're in a big jam here. You lie to me and I can't help you out. Do you understand me?
3B616C0D     //  Yes.
11A8AA28     //  Your marriage was over. You took her in and she threw it back in your face. You didn't go over there to hurt her. It just got out of hand.
5C3C42AF     //  That's not how it was.
B0AD7465     //  It wasn't the first time you hit her, was it, Jacob?
42493012     //  This might sound dumb, but sometimes I had to defend myself. She was strong and dangerous when she was drunk.
C76843C6     //  Jacob, I think she pushed you around and slapped you about. You got to like it. Big guy like you and you're a fucking pushover...
8CD65043     //  Fuck you! I did my best to make it work.
5B836357     //  You're lying, Jacob. It was falling apart and things got violent.
AB63179A     //  I'm not lying. I'm telling you how it was.
10A4077A     //  My marriage wasn't violent. Cold, sick, painful sometimes, maybe. But not violent.
D4DAE42D     //  The owner of the Turkey Bowl restaurant said that she was telling the whole diner how you knocked her around.
0F4F19C3     //  Jenny Horgan says you blackened her eye.
3AD186C4     //  It's alright, Jacob. The DA will understand. In your shoes, I would have done exactly the same thing.
67BD3B6B     //  I hit her, alright? 
54C9ACC5     //  I'm not proud of it, but she was coming at me with a frying pan. What would you do? 
DD0548E2     //  I took it for years but sometimes a man can only take so much.
528DA472     //  What do you do for work, Jacob?
6905D1B6     //  I'm a mechanic. Engines, differentials, transmissions - that kind of stuff.
08805CF3     //  So you have access to tools?
9A425F0F     //  Yes, I do.
7B7B811D     //  Your wife was brutally beaten with a socket wrench handle, then stomped to death. How do you think that looks, Jacob?
D8B0AD8B     //  I was home in bed.
4505AF3D     //  You'll have to do better than that, Jacob.
D31EA565     //  Check with Dick McColl at the Bamba. He'll tell you I was at home.
DB97EE4C     //  You were at home in bed while your wife was putting out to some stranger? What kind of man are you, Jacob, that you allow that?
3F386666     //  You son of a bitch! You got no right talking about my wife like that.
FAA30064     //  You're full of shit, Jacob. 
8DCF815E     //  The truth is you hated that bitch. 
5C806D63     //  You followed her and dragged her into the car and then took her out to the Moors. 
9F2CB80E     //  She woke up and you smashed her face in with a socket wrench.
B1266C7C     //  Look, I don't have anything more to say.
699C5A46     //  I want to see my lawyer.
C73F4849     //  Stop wasting time. You got me here. Let's finish this.
B16AADEF     //  I'm not gonna crack.
A7E5051F     //  Please believe me. I didn't kill my wife.
770736A2     //  You can shove your theories. I am done.
ED801296     //  Phelps. You've failed me, son.
BCA534F0     //  We have another lead, Captain. This guy Mendez could be our man.
9570C0DF     //  I hope so, Phelps. I really hope so. I'm deeply disturbed by your style of police work.
3D0278FE     //  If you didn't kill her then who did, Jacob?
F91035DF     //  I... I don't know. I... 
623DD4C3     //  I don't like to think about it. I know she met other men. I know it. 
3A89F7FE     //  Maybe it was one of them?
C90FAE74     //  You used your wife's lipstick to leave us a message. Was it a cry for help, Jacob?
1AF74F95     //  For the last time, I didn't kill my wife.
DCF94553     //  I'm done with you. You should charge me or let me go. If not I'm gonna get myself a lawyer.
319B2AD5     //  I'll see what I can do for you, Jacob. But I'm not promising. It still looks bad for you.
D197016D     //  I don't see any way out of this unless you give us something.
0099BD01     //  Why did you break into your wife's house, Jacob? Why steal the ring?
C12220C9     //  What? What are you talking about? I've got a key. 
18BA3C4F     //  Why would I need to break in?
1CDFD8D1     //  You took the ring because you found out who gave it to her.
C8E25565     //  What are you talking about?
7E5C2B9B     //  Her prized garnet ring, given to her by her old boyfriend Dick McColl.
AB54734D     //  I never knew that. 
F6E90F1C     //  I lived with that woman for three years and I never knew that. 
A83A1476     //   In that case, I think you should be talking to Dick McColl.
95AE7F08     //  We'll do the detective work, lunkhead. Just answer the questions.
94BFE49F     //  So a burglar broke in the same night that Celine was murdered. You expect me to buy that?
4B43F800     //  I didn't break in. How many different ways do you want me to say it?
7BEDC091     //  Where did you hock the jewelry, Jacob? 
73B1DB3B     //  Do you know how cheap you're going to look to the Grand Jury? 
42A8F7C4     //  'Husband murders wife and sells her jewels'?
28FBCF39     //  I didn't steal my wife's ring. I've never stolen a goddamn thing my whole life and I'll fight any man who says I did.
2A702949     //  I may not have a fancy job, I may not have a lot of money. But I still have my pride, you dirty son of a bitch.
9EFF582F     //  No, no, no, no, no, no...
703470DC     //  And then you stomped her. 
0EACAD39     //  You stomped her because she's a drunken whore and she treated you like shit. 
D4C91643     //  You stomped her for all the years you had to take it. 
2B564907     //  You stomped her because you are such a weak fucking sister, Jacob, 
3532F552     //  and you wanted to erase all memory of it. Go on. Try to deny it.
78169EF4     //  I was at home. I should have gone to her at the bar but I didn't. 
0A540D77     //  You can't prove I wasn't home.
A2633357     //  I can. The bar owner - McColl - gave you up. He called your house, right at the time that someone was smashing Celine's skull in, and got no answer. If we find that socket wrench you're going to fry. Get it off your chest. Tell me you killed her.
DCD59AE0     //  I killed her alright. I killed her dreams. 
3A6A91FE     //  She was an aviator, famous in her day. 
91265875     //  Flying around up there like a bird, but she never wanted to come back down. 
9A6FA5B4     //  You know, my pop was a sod farmer. Dirt poor. 
C6CF0D2C     //  I joined the Corps, trained to be a mechanic. 
CBD49383     //  I did better than my father did. 
E9007F34     //  I worked hard for it. 
90D8ECBF     //  That's all you can ask of a man. 
3F366108     //  But Celine, she never wanted to come down from the clouds. 
7202BD71     //  She wanted everything I couldn't give her. 
6C76CF92     //  All I had was security. 
4DCB544C     //  That was never going to be enough.
EECA376D     //  I hope if you ever suffer a loss, people treat you with more dignity than you've been offering me.
76DCE5A1     //  You did it. Everything points to you. What does 'Tex' mean, Jacob?
E430773C     //  I don't know what you're talking about.
D3C4BE56     //  I need a reason to believe you, Jacob.
2532BFF5     //  You want a confession? That's what you want?
A33F453B     //  That's exactly what we want.
1691B23C     //  Seems to me there are two types of marriages. 
CF839ABC     //  The first, where the couple love each other equally and everything's roses. 
03434E83     //  And then there's the other, where one person loves the other more than life itself and always puts them first. 
F7CDE0D5     //  Chumps like me, who love them no matter what, no matter how badly they behave. 
A4CF89B9     //  That's it. That's my confession. 
52DF51A7     //  I loved my wife. And I'll take any test you got to prove it.
C98E06B7     //  Phelps. Outstanding, young man.
98534D0F     //  In the good old days we would be calling for the hangman.
23D2DA39     //  We have another lead, Captain. This guy, Mendez.
1B3BDDA9     //  You've laid a charge?
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
2169460F     //  So be it.
8064ACCD     //  Mendez. Apartment sixteen.

AE10EF8C     //  She'll tell you I left, and what time.
216BFE5E     //  That's a lie, and you know it. You tailed her, watched her come out of a bar, and then beat her to death. Admit it, Henry.
4889C836     //  Why would I do that, Detective?
7C57311F     //  My wife was a drunk. It was a sickness with her. Doesn't mean I didn't love her. Would you stop loving your wife if she was unwell?
684D87CC     //  No, I wouldn't.
47B62734     //  So who could have killed Celine? Where did she go last night, Jacob?
E445BEB9     //  A bar, I suppose. Look, I don't know.
980F5D37     //  We know that she drinks, Jacob. Drunks have regular haunts. Places they feel relaxed.
611DF9DE     //  Celine did most of her drinking at home. She didn't have many friends left. Not many alcoholics do. Not real friends anyway.
3FFE231E     //  We get the impression that Celine liked to live the glamorous life. How did she end up with a hump like you, Jacob?
64CC769C     //  Celine was one of the first woman pilots. 
61DD3F88     //  She hung out with movie stars and royalty, 
A60522FE     //  but when she came back here broke and struggling, 
818B2D5C     //  she married a mechanic who put a roof over her head, food on the table.

D14D6ED9     //  I'm not ashamed about that.
FA04CFF5     //  You know where she went, Jacob. You're lying. Why would I help you if you keep lying to me?
138321F9     //  Look, I'm telling you I don't know.

95AC58C1     //  I came back here. I was here all night.

1D5BB2F6     //  Did a neighbor see you? Did you talk to anyone? You need an alibi, Jacob.
80CAF292     //  I don't have one. I was here. I listened to Amos and Andy on the radio and then I went to bed.
C747E5EE     //  So you were here tucked up in bed, while someone was out there beating your wife's brains out? That's all you've got?

DC23F07F     //  McColl says he called and called and you didn't pick up.
75EC264B     //  I tried to get her help and she laughed in my face. Then of course she needs me. I'd had enough. Everyone has their limit.
8FE834EA     //  We're still going to need you to come Downtown, Mr Henry.
4F8CDC2A     //  We can get this all down on paper, Jacob. How you got fed up with your wife, and how you figured killing her would bury all your troubles.
9B525833     //  I don't think Jacob is our man but we should see what he has to say.
D7502D35     //  Jacob Henry's apartment again. The boy has skeletons in his closet.
1BFC6EDA     //  Alright, knock. All nice and polite.
43900F04     //  Search the place. We need something on this guy. Something that'll stick.
4C56FA7F     //  Ask him some questions. Keep it simple. I'll do the rest.
9820E5E0     //  Hurry it up and call in, Phelps. I'm not sitting on this asshole forever.
56C314D2     //  Why not follow up on the Bamba? I could use a belt.
8B54859A     //  We should get back to the Bamba, check for witnesses and evidence and junk.
A5A1CF92     //  Bartender, Phelps. Go. Then I can get a drink.
F45D0E32     //  What? Jesus. Can you go talk to the owner already? Leave me in peace for a second.
6D195C5D     //  Probably better call in that license plate, Phelps. See if we can turn that car up.
BE431189     //  I wonder if we should check that Turkey Bowl lead before it goes cold.

D6429A6C     //  There's only so far we can get leaving Jacob to stew, Phelps. Let's get back in there and take another run at him.
3B1AE49B     //  Soon as we set foot in that interview room, I bet Henry will crack. Let's get there.
2A80C3F2     //  We can still pull down a conviction for the Skipper if we chase down this Mendez guy.

611C1B4B     //  The hot sheet is posted here next to the map.
DE729A80     //  What's his problem?
683180FE     //  That's Biggs. He's an institution.
7ABD1779     //  So this is what all the fuss is about.
9975B0F1     //  Why couldn't they build a freeway that goes past my place?
7BE945D1     //  They haven't even approved the money yet, kid. The bond issue won't be till December. It will be years before any of this will happen.
7CD7A2AB     //  Here's your new partner, Stefan Bekowsky.
72D0D7AF     //  I've heard all about you, Phelps. You go easy on me and let me earn the odd citation and maybe we will get along fine.
3A6B0630     //  I'm here to learn, Detective.
6FE99379     //  He's an intense one, isn't he, Mel?
66AB3126     //  Who's intense?
0D90CDDB     //  The newly minted detective here. Cole Phelps.
D16AF186     //  Hi, Phelps. I'll be keeping an eye on you. I could spend a little time basking in reflected glory. 
1812F67F     //  Would make a change from busting hookers and dope fiends.
982AAA59     //  Who was that, Commander?
A3B91056     //  Roy Earle, Chief Detective in Ad Vice.
A2B6736B     //  Do they all dress like movie stars?
97CFA47D     //  Roy is a movie star, and the whole of the seedy side of LA is his audience.
07AAEB02     //  What is that supposed to mean?
D6F59958     //  Stick with me, kid. You'll find out.
62E7000C     //  And now, some housekeeping. A warm Central Division welcome for Detective Cole Phelps.
67654735     //  Some of you guys may know Phelps. He's the cop who broke the jewelry store murder. 
DA44C80C     //  Stand up and take a bow, Phelps.
3416AA0B     //  If it's alright with you, sir...
E68D68FC     //  That's an order, Phelps.
217F3864     //  Phelps is one of only two serving LAPD officers who received the Silver Star during the war. You really gave it to those lousy Japanese, hey, Phelps?
5CB2550D     //  I did my best, Captain.
05775FB4     //  Why are you war heroes always so modest?
50709EA4     //  I've partnered Phelps with everyone's favorite Pole, Stefan Bekowsky.
EDBD5CD5     //  Hope you like work, kid. Bekowsky sure as hell doesn't.
DE933463     //  That's why we have partners, right?
45BD46E6     //  Okay, okay. Can it, guys. 
72D25DF0     //  Stick with Bekowsky. 
F141F55B     //  He's a good cop, and he knows Traffic inside and out.
E2026C05     //  I'm going to start you out with one case. You do okay, I'll give you a couple more. 
0884266A     //  You screw up, you'll be rousting vagrants and running license plates. 
CC9CE33F     //  Now get down to the PE Freight Depot, Sixth and Alameda. 
6F67ABC8     //  A patrolman called in a suspicious vehicle, signs of foul play. See what you can find out.
5DF2CC0E     //  Come on, Phelps.
21759AA2     //  You need a special invitation, Detective? Get to work.
995CEA55     //  Get on with it, gentlemen.
50D32677     //  You're wasting time. Get outta here.
BF8D1F6A     //  They really pushed you through quick, didn't they? Six years on patrol before I got this desk, you were here in five minutes.
6B259499     //  What do you want me to say? I didn't ask for any favors.
70441B15     //  You know this place?
89DF6222     //  You can drive.
1D4D005D     //  Sure. It's near the old gas works and signal depot, in the warehouse district. I'll direct.
043A2862     //  So - tell me a little about yourself, Phelps.
B8179727     //  Are we friends now, Bekowsky?
4D96D11F     //  We have to work together. Don't be so touchy.
70530A4B     //  I grew up in San Francisco. My father was in shipping. Went to college at Stanford, did two years ROTC before Marine OCS at Camp Elliott. Shipped out in early '45 as a First Lieutenant and fought in the Okinawa campaign. I was wounded and shipped back home. Did a year on the beat and now I'm here.
D3B455EB     //  So you won the Silver Star?
A2D4024B     //  I don't want to talk about it.
F20D78E7     //  Let me get this straight - you singlehandedly killed forty Japs on this hill in Okinawa...
A5C1F573     //  No.
7CDBB570     //  You were up there all night, draped in the flag, knife between your teeth, gun at the ready...
B49060AC     //  You finished?
A3F33129     //  The Emperor Hirohito himself leading the charge against you...
74338874     //  I did my part, Bekowsky. What did you do?
E6576C01     //  I kept the streets of LA safe for the people.
FF5060FC     //  Yeah. Now I get it. Unfit for service.
26179627     //  Fuck you, Phelps. I earned a bravery citation during the Zooter riots.
014841D6     //  Sounds like you had it rough.
86094585     //  I did my job.
418DC6AF     //  No-one is saying you didn't.
4F5034F2     //  I did six years as a patrolman.
AC2321C6     //  That's the third time you've told me.
4D6AF7AE     //  That you, Bekowsky?
BEF5D252     //  Go on through. Parking lot straight ahead.
8C888231     //  I think the guys are waiting for you.
B2F3D63A     //  No good asking me. I'm just here to keep the public away.
06BF0749     //  I need to get back to work, Officer.
10C858C5     //  The detectives are here now. You repeat to them what you told me.
7DFEA07E     //  I did the right thing by calling this in. I'm just a working stiff.
A45ADB01     //  Just give them your story and you'll be alright.
444E09FB     //  This is your first case, Phelps. It's okay to admit it if you're stumped. If you don't know what to do next, just come talk to me and we'll see what we can figure out.
30901E7B     //  Thanks, Stefan. You're okay.
11C3C78F     //  I'm Officer Hart.
39678E01     //  Phelps, Traffic. What have you got?
18B15B5D     //  Abandoned car - probably stolen. The solid citizen is Nate Wilkey. He called it in.
7E483BD2     //  What gives with the coroner?
CEDDDDE3     //  There's blood all over the interior. Someone's copped the full Broderick, but no stiff as yet.
45560A8E     //  We have an owner for the car?
34F7796E     //  The car is registered to an Adrian Black, just north of Bunker Hill.
5882E3D7     //  Alright. We'll take a look around.
8F5644CF     //  I'll keep Mr Wilkey talking. But don't make him wait too long. He's the restless type.
8320587F     //  Hey, what's the hurry, mac? Take your time. Smell the roses.
729C4840     //  You giving me the high hat?
1EAEE270     //  This scene is a mess. Could have been a dozen different crimes committed down here with all of the 'bos hopping freights.
5BA5C18A     //  I'll have the car towed down to the impound. That's about all I can do here.
B6EBD356     //  Stenzel glasses. Home repaired, by the look of it.
3449BD2D     //  The brand name might give us something to go on.
357FF34A     //  Victim looks to have lost a lot of blood.
0B72BD4F     //  Mr F Morgan picked up a live pig yesterday?
4C0D829F     //  Thirty-two years old. Married. Sounds like an average guy. What was he doing out here?
2A1BB55A     //  Happier times, I guess.
E7A5D0BB     //  Hey flatfoot! You looking to get rid of that old crate? 
E9FC985C     //  I'll give you a nickel for it!
44CC9169     //  Why you looking at me? I can't help you with what's going on here.
92ED30F1     //  Don't try and drag me into this thing.
E2E64A69     //  What's going on, Detective? Something bad happen here?
ED87F6AE     //  You cops have had the whole place sewn up tight for hours.
CF3BD247     //  I hope you catch someone for this, but don't look at me.
9C930D05     //  You guys take your time. No freight coming through here till you're done, and we're still punching the clock.
4A4B3F14     //  You should see the foreman. I think he's about to blow his stack.
99DAE7AC     //  How long till all this gets cleared? Couple of hours at least, right?
B65EACEB     //  Have you got a wide shot of the car in its surrounds?
63C46A0A     //  Listen, you and I have never met so I'm just gonna go ahead and say this once - you don't tell me how to do my job, and I won't tell you how to do yours.
80A9E00F     //  I've got half an hour to spend on this thing. The lab are short staffed Downtown.
0E97DE45     //  Tech Services and R&I are your best friends, but you better get on with the case.
0DC9CA41     //  Morning, Sam.
6FA2062F     //  Roger.
E0854A44     //  How's the world looking?
771FBB43     //  Always the same through a viewfinder. How about you?
6267B744     //  I've got a mystery sample waiting at the lab. Practical jokers say it's contaminated soil. My guess... it's a big lump of shit.
41CEA9BB     //  I thought you were on vacation?
0B825196     //  Got canceled. The old bounce was a pain in the ass, so I got myself a couple of new ones.
0A9A0E0F     //  How's life treating you?
6C247B62     //  After this, I've got two more jobs in Westlake Park and one up in the Hollywood Hills.
71F014AD     //  Ouch.
070339FE     //  Don't ask questions if you don't wanna hear the answers.
AE7204F9     //  Detective? Take a look at this.
39A2CB59     //  Something for you here.
43C821EE     //  You want shots of this one, mac?
849A5709     //  I think you might want to see this.
92C1649C     //  You wanna talk about women, talk to me. You wanna talk about the case, I'd say the coroner and the witness would be your best bet.
4353C75A     //  Hey, I'm just the lens. I don't know nothing.
BE3E86DF     //  Come check this out. I found a steel pipe with blood on it.
D47722B4     //  Over here, Phelps. The trunk is unlocked. Better take a look at it.
EA9F0AEB     //  Get back here, Phelps. We're not done yet. 
B1F2BE7E     //  Keep searching.
BA7507AB     //  Here, Phelps. This is it.
29DE8B19     //  You going to take a look at this or what?
68DB196B     //  It's crime scene evidence, Phelps. 
A1D8E195     //  You go to it, it doesn't come to you.
883E93FD     //  Sir, I'm Detective Phelps.
4D541D22     //  The name's Nate Wilkey.
EA4E9D18     //  You found the vehicle?
CAD28F12     //  Sure. Saw it just sitting there. A strange place to be parking your car. Figured I'd better take a look, then I saw all the blood, so I called the police.
086C4AA9     //  Mind if I ask what you were doing out here?
407A6081     //  Well, I work for the railway. I was on my way out to the switch and reckoned I'd take a shortcut.
BCE916D2     //  Did you see anybody else in the yard? Maybe somebody hanging around the car?
94626F0E     //  Nope. I hadn't seen a soul all day till you boys turned up.
D6785DB9     //  You're holding out on me. Spill it!
977A33DE     //  I'm telling you all I know. I already wasted hours getting involved in this thing.
18C9B91C     //  Why are you lying to me? You know what happened to the driver.
BB97C690     //  You got some way of proving I had something to do with that car?
F28DCC8D     //  You want to take a look at your attitude, mister.
A52B2E18     //  We found a steel pipe with blood on it near the car. Do you know anything about it, Mr Wilkey?
D474DF02     //  No, sir. I went straight for the law when I saw the car was full of blood.
E30EE4D4     //  When you saw the blood, was it wet? Bright red? Or darker like it is now?
3C79B72A     //  Darker, I'd say. Looked dry already.
19B85829     //  You picked it up. You moved it. Why is it so far from the car?
0359F229     //  Goddammit, how in the hell would I know? That's it for me and police business from here on.
E2291A11     //  Tell me the truth! You hit the driver with the pipe.
F43780C8     //  You can't prove I touched that pipe. I think you should take that gun off, and I'll teach you a lesson in some manners.
6D83B720     //  You want to arrest me now or can I go back to work?
DCBE9A4D     //  The wallet by the car, was there anything in it when you arrived?
5C48F2E5     //  You accusing me of something, mister?
24658004     //  It's a simple question, Mr Wilkey.
5337885C     //  I wouldn't know what was in that wallet. I never touched it.
1BCB6F12     //  Do you want the patrolman to hold you down while we turn out your pockets, Mr Wilkey?
F92795FC     //  Maybe I checked inside that wallet. Not that I was going to steal anything. Maybe I took a look... but there weren't no money in there. Not even change.
15C938A9     //  Tell the truth, Mr Wilkey. You rifled the wallet.
72111E97     //  My money is my money. 
376DEBF6     //  You can't prove I touched that wallet.
75BCE437     //  Man does the right thing and the police try to turn him into a criminal.
71D036EE     //  Do you know Adrian Black, Mr Wilkey?
9AC4626E     //  No, sir, that ain't a name I'm familiar with.
C3DBB127     //  You ever seen the car before?
73660600     //  Funny enough, I did. A couple of nights ago it was over there in the parking lot. I know most of the cars that park here regular, so it kinda stood out.
4970E186     //  Do you want to tell me what you know, or do we have to take you in and loosen you up a little?
A54165D9     //  Who do you think you are, talking to me like that? You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
A50EEEBC     //  Am I going to have to stand here all day until you tell me the truth? You know the driver.
1823FF11     //  I'm telling you I don't know who was driving that car. You can prove it different?
81F113F8     //  The gun, the power - they go to your head, son. It's about time you made me an apology.
64EA6B2B     //  I've been standing around here for an hour, so you damn well listen.
4C762F88     //  You ain't happy what I've got to tell, I'd best be on my way.
FA00D2AD     //  I'd best be heading back to work. My boss is going to give me hell regardless. This is your problem now.
B7BDD492     //  I've told you all I can. I gotta go back to work, or I'll lose my job.
5D11065D     //  You know, my nephew joined the police. And he's a little slow, too.
33D4C33B     //  How long you gonna keep me here, sir?
5A8BA067     //  You know what? I'm done being helpful.
FAF20046     //  No way am I helping you any more.
7AAB3BF4     //  Thank you for your help, Mr Wilkey. We'll contact your employer if we need anything more from you.
6C8EEF18     //  If you have to, I guess. I can't really spend no more time over this.
FDD9D452     //  Don't leave town, Mr Wilkey. We'll get in touch with your employer if we need anything more from you.
C00D41BD     //  I'll let him know why I missed half my shift today. You boys should learn some gratitude.
47CC6F18     //  Thank you for your patience, Mr Wilkey. If you don't mind waiting a little longer, I'm sure we'll have more questions once we've had a look around.
CADDB8D4     //  Doc.
F665A66E     //  Detective...?
FFE02CD4     //  Phelps. What have we got?
7B775385     //  A lot of blood for a blunt force injury. The victim must be in a very bad way.
136A0210     //  Any sign of the guy?
D3EEE466     //  Not unless he's in the trunk of the car.
0540B94F     //  There's something here that you ought to see, Detective.
CC9D0E82     //  I have another five cases to get to this morning, Detective.
C87299F3     //  The blood... the sheer amount of it is puzzling... not much I can do without a victim.
5CCD15FE     //  We're going to notify the wife. You seem to have it under control here.
862B8E36     //  Yeah. I got this.
0FDD5D0E     //  620 Bunker Hill Avenue. You know where that is?
7FFD086B     //  Behind Bunker Hill. Couple of blocks north of Central Station.
75F34A7B     //  So what do we tell the wife?
8C943265     //  We play it by the book. There's no stiff yet, so let's see how it plays out.
380876BE     //  Could be a car theft gone wrong. Make Black drive somewhere lonely then give him a tap...
EBA238AD     //  But why leave the car?
1D4C7E59     //  Well, obviously someone got a little heavy-handed...
8751F98D     //  It's the wrong way around.
28408047     //  How so, genius?
63755F82     //  Where is Adrian? 
43528C52     //  If you've gone to all the trouble to steal the car, 
9CBF9551     //  and it goes wrong, you'd leave the body behind. Not the car.
CA17B4C6     //  You've got something there, Phelps. It doesn't add up.
91A67A5D     //  You read about the guy on the crossing yesterday?
CC1AD17D     //  No. What happened?
02722CEC     //  Over on Lincoln Avenue. 
5F7AC6A3     //  This guy is driving along and his oil light comes on. 
B6762074     //  He stops the car and gets out... he pops the hood, and...
667819C4     //  He's on a rail crossing?
E4D21C74     //  You got it. 
B7674BC9     //  He's got his head under there checking the oil 
6A38FEEF     //  when the Southern Pacific freight slams into his car doing ninety miles an hour. 
E1AA01CD     //  Car came to a rest more than a mile down the track.
32E78354     //  What a pointless waste of life.
70D2CB66     //  You'll get plenty of blood and guts and mindless stupidity working Traffic, Phelps. 
991F9035     //  Who needs the 2nd Amendment when we'll give a goddamn fool the license 
FDB3F093     //  to get behind the wheel of an automobile?
2FC240FA     //  Where you going, Phelps? This is the place.
8CB6BE62     //  Just a minute!
3B33ED0B     //  LAPD, Mrs Black. May we come in? 
87583678     //  We have some bad news and we would rather discuss this in private.
5F15386D     //  I'm Margaret Black. We can discuss this in the living room. Please, come in.
38C0F38F     //  Your husband drives a blue Lincoln, Mrs Black?
7486A61D     //  That's correct.
B2C77EC5     //  The car has been found abandoned, and I'm afraid there are signs of foul play.
3B217B7C     //  I knew something was wrong when he didn't come home!
25300011     //  We believe your husband may be injured. We found a pipe on the scene with blood on it.
E67BD110     //  Oh no! My poor Adrian.
C1394B10     //  Does the name InstaHeat mean anything to you, ma'am?
A025C713     //  Yes, it does... we've just had a new water heater installed.
BE490E60     //  Whereabouts, Mrs Black?
9A80BEF9     //  Just outside the kitchen window. At the side of the house.
56BB24E8     //  I'd like you to try and stay calm and remember everything that you can about last night. My partner and I are going to take a look around. When you're ready, we're going to have some more questions for you. Is that okay?
94ADFA41     //  Of course, Officer. Anything to help secure my husband's safety.
0A91945E     //  Let's check the place out. Come on.
9A5E7AD7     //  This must be Adrian's.
AD840B9B     //  That can't be right.
00AF86A8     //  No, that won't work.
88EDB75E     //  That looks wrong.
6DB6E61A     //  Doesn't go there.
80C4C359     //  No use leaving the thing half finished.
6BBA0933     //  Stenzel. So, the glasses are a match.
D69C8A6B     //  InstaHeat. Well, at least we know their wares are built to last.
9F21D475     //  So the pipe missing from Mr Black's heater is the same one that killed him. Seems like the assailant is a little closer to home.
4BBC838D     //  Separate bedrooms, separate pictures. What gives here?
0C1ED216     //  'To my Adrian'... 
F9EF6B38     //  This thing gets more and more interesting.
F52FBFE0     //  Cavanagh's. So who brought this home?
4086B2FC     //  Maybe Adrian was a patron? R&I should have an address.
C8744B39     //  A used ticket to Seattle and a suitcase gone missing. Someone couldn't wait to get out of this house.
09F710DF     //  This was only recently installed. Not two days ago.
FB585449     //  So this is how all the pieces fit together.
BC32034E     //  I wonder if someone in the house bought this unit knowing how they would use the parts.
20C46DB8     //  I found a pipe with InstaHeat on it at the crime scene. I wonder if someone in this house bought the unit knowing how they'd use the parts?
29B4131F     //   I'm alright now, Detectives.
89C7E237     //  Do you think you could answer some questions now, Mrs Black?
87B42BEB     //  Of course. However I can help.
BF7464F0     //  We found a receipt in the trunk of your husband's car for a live pig. The receipt was made out to an F Morgan.
E4953438     //  A pig? Adrian runs a tool business. That would be Frank Morgan. God knows what he is up to.
7C778264     //  What makes you say that about Morgan, ma'am?
BFE3BBEC     //  He's the foreman at my husband's plant. A very shady character. I've told Adrian he needs to keep his distance from the staff. They're always out drinking together.
75E1C89F     //  This situation doesn't look good, Margaret. You need to tell me what you know.
C1FFC704     //  There's no need to be so aggressive. 
C0BBD7A9     //  I'm also a victim.
C46607EE     //  You're lying. You killed your husband and Morgan helped you cover it up.
59280E19     //  How dare you! I love my husband. 
9BC5DDC3     //  On what basis could you possibly accuse me of wanting to hurt him?
ABDCF168     //  It's hardly surprising the police force has such a bad reputation, with people like you representing them.
CCAE9C4E     //  Your husband frequents Cavanagh's Bar?
E0B0A425     //  How did you know that? Adrian practically lives there after work.
634FADB4     //  So Adrian spends a lot of time there?
D0CF1A72     //  Up until recently. He's been away in Seattle a lot on business.
BD2FCAA4     //  So your husband would rather spend time in a bar than be at home with you, Mrs Black? And that makes you angry?
71223ADE     //  Yes, it does make me angry. 
9C45E608     //  But I know my place, Officer. Unlike you.
BEDA90ED     //  You're lying, Margaret. You're a lush. Cavanagh's is your hangout.
B5C894F3     //  Your tiny mind must really be aching. 
9DD12B11     //  Do you have any evidence that proves I have ever been in that bar?
50EBD224     //  I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
137A5D34     //  I'm going to ring my attorney. 
9E12325B     //  I hope you are well paid, Detective.
2DCB7649     //  Was your husband wearing his glasses when he left here yesterday?
E93CAA87     //  Yes, he just bought a new pair.
DBA8B27F     //  Go on.
337EE3D7     //  I kept telling him to throw those old ones away. He tried to repair them with tape. They looked terrible.
5C0DB6AC     //  So you disposed of the new pair after you killed your husband? You made a mistake leaving the old pair behind.
005887F1     //  I never did! 
46BAAB28     //  How can you be so heartless, throwing around accusations at a time like this?
51EB68E9     //  That's a lie, Margaret. You know exactly what pair he was wearing, because you were there.
052D966D     //  You're being flat-out ridiculous now. Why don't you show me some proof of where I was supposed to be?
B0C38253     //  If I was there, at least I'd know what happened to him. But I don't, Detective. And you might not care, but that is the most terrible feeling.
F774D2D6     //  Tell us about the photo of Adrian in the bedroom.
275F604B     //  What is there to tell? It's from his most recent business trip to Seattle.
D06C7FC0     //  What was the purpose of Adrian's trip to Seattle, Mrs Black?
55D6B177     //  He was meeting with some distributors. 
B10A8780     //  Adrian said that it was important to make contact interstate, if he was going to grow his business.
90ABDE10     //  You and your husband are in separate bedrooms. What gives? Did you want him out of the way, Margaret?
61AF9375     //  No, I did not. My husband and I may have drifted apart but it wasn't my choice.
58564118     //  There's plenty to tell, you just won't tell it. You're lying about the photograph, Mrs Black.
2D857A24     //  You're incredibly rude and insensitive, but I guess you know that. I've told you what I know about the picture.
1A26DBE0     //  You're wrong. I presume it's too much to expect an apology?
1414EDB9     //  What about Nicole, Mrs Black? Was your husband going to leave you for her?
1D0D9FB5     //  I've seen the photo frame. 
C5D768E9     //  He thinks I'm stupid... but women sense these things. 
09A2CD2F     //  I don't know if he intended to leave me, or if it was just a fling... 
DE945E52     //  God only knows. I only want to know that he's safe.
0EDF2496     //  Did your husband tell you where he was going last night?
46EFFA4E     //  All he said was, he was going to meet Frank for a drink.
0A93DD81     //  So nothing out of the usual then?
3719AB52     //  Well, he came home early from work. 
2D9E14F5     //  He never comes home early. 
F1EE8246     //  And he went out early, too. 
7F085DFC     //  He normally never leaves for the bar till about seven.
592CE437     //  So you didn't arrange to meet him out at the railyards?
E859D651     //  I've never been near a railyard in my life.
A23D2E22     //  But you knew where he was really going, because you told him to meet you at the railyards. 
4E5ECDB2     //  That's where you jumped him. 
0E2C9086     //  How did you hide the body?
0E90FA68     //  You have an overly active imagination, young man. 
8AEE2231     //  Do you have any proof of that allegation?
8661197F     //  My husband is missing. 
3567F747     //  You say he may be hurt, and the best you can do is berate me. You're a poor example of a man.
5CE41061     //  I think you should come clean with us, Mrs Black. Your husband is missing and after our search I'm willing to call the circumstances suspicious. Can you account for your movements last night?
F00DA591     //  You're not accusing me, are you? What an awful thing to say! I was here all night, of course, waiting for Adrian to come home!
04DB27A2     //  Is there anyone who can vouch for that?
CD8FEC4C     //  Well... no. I was here alone. 
BB289E93     //  I cooked Adrian's dinner and waited, but he never came home.
BEB6F814     //  The evidence is stacking up, Mrs Black. It all places you at the railyard last night.
A17B90A0     //  I've already told you I was here all night alone. 
525B9BE4     //  Your stack of evidence doesn't change a thing.
7FFEF6B0     //  Yes, I am accusing you. Your husband was going to leave you - that's motive. Now your only alibi is an empty house. Get it off your chest - tell me the truth.
1F3E33DE     //  Whatever your theories are, you're going to have to prove that I was there and that I wanted to hurt him. 
840331FC     //  Do you think you can do that, Detective?
A4188CA1     //  Find my husband, you incompetent fool, or the LAPD will be facing a lawsuit.
F8466A20     //  You're leaving already? You sure you don't have more questions?
E9054E61     //  Oh, is that all? I would hope you're taking this case more seriously, Detective!
B4912053     //  I'm sorry. 
7E3B0E21     //  If there's nothing more, I really think I should lie down.
8D2F4F9D     //  Find Adrian, officer. Bring him home. Please.
67F1E2A6     //  Are you trying to find my husband?
27675BDE     //  Please hurry. My husband might be injured.
A9C0445A     //  Don't you say another word to me. Get out of my house.
AAA6ED0C     //  You're just a bully. I'm not answering any more questions.
E69B783E     //  We'll keep you informed, Mrs Black.
25B0D294     //  Please do, Detective.
AAD5A3B1     //  Our job is to find out what happened to your husband. Your lack of cooperation can only hinder our investigation, Mrs Black.
6C1FB63B     //  I need an address on a Cavanagh's Bar.
2CF9F893     //  Certainly, Detective. One moment... Cavanagh's Bar, corner of Aliso and Hewitt. South side of Union Station.
7916701E     //  Thanks for your help.
979F39CB     //  Jesus, I'm glad to be out of there.
DF2D21A2     //  Mr and Mrs Black don't seem to have the happiest home life.
CBCE0531     //  He's too scared to divorce her, and she's too much of a shrinking violet to throw him out. If this hadn't happened, they could have stayed miserable together forever.
67B04D9B     //  You think she could have killed him?
230CF5F7     //  She sure as hell doesn't seem the type. But stranger things have happened.
230878C1     //  Hey! I know you.
CB69256E     //  No, you don't.
AC57A9CB     //  We were at school together. Hey - how about you buy me a drink for old time's sake?
EA6A80AE     //  Yeah, you and me go way back. Way, way back. Ain't that right?
254E5B0B     //  Bourbon, tall glass, no ice. Hey - just bring me the bottle?
086579CD     //  Wait! I just want somebody to talk to.
BE7C9F9D     //  You looking for someone?
FAC05E61     //  LAPD. We're looking for any known associates of Adrian Black.
FEB30869     //  Adrian? He's here most nights with Frank Morgan. They camp out at the table in back and talk until closing. Frank's back there now.
FA8F3A14     //  You know Frank Morgan?
8327A60A     //  Sure. Frank's a regular. He's the loner in the back.
43029B95     //  Come on, the barkeep doesn't have all the answers. Leave me be.
049D2B83     //  You want a drink or not?
046E64FE     //  I wasn't done talking. Back here, pal.
9936190E     //  Frank Morgan?
B5A5C072     //  Who's asking?
2F0C64B1     //  Cole Phelps, LAPD. I understand you're a friend of Adrian Black.
7915806C     //  Yeah, I know him.
0A6F25FB     //  Are you aware that he's missing?
97AF2FAF     //  No, I hadn't heard that. Tough break.
20E175AC     //  When did you last see Adrian?
47FE7FB2     //  Hell, I don't know. 
92C9C15E     //  I had plenty to drink last night. Things are a little sketchy.
5AF8A66D     //  Come on, Morgan. It was only last night. You must remember something.
657A3C02     //  Look, we might have had a drink. We have a drink most nights after work.
74E60725     //  If he was on his way to meet you when he went missing, 
71C7A385     //  you're going to have to do a lot better than 'I don't recall'.
BFD4A9A6     //  He had a couple and then left, I guess. Maybe he had to go meet someone. That's the best I can do.
C14109D3     //  You're lying, Morgan. What happened to Adrian?
6EB36E0E     //  I have ten guys who will say I was here the whole night. You think you can prove I was there?
FC6A3642     //  You through making accusations you can't back up?
23FEA494     //  You signed your name and left it on the slaughterhouse receipt, Frank. We couldn't have you colder if we'd found you curled up on the back seat.
0794241F     //  Alright, alright. I helped him. He wanted it to look like his car got hijacked. He's fallen for some dame up in Seattle, and now he's gotta go start a new life with her. Goddamn fool.
4DFD7C35     //  We found Black's car abandoned in a freight depot. Covered in blood. You know anything about that, Morgan?
073D7C80     //  Hell no. I'm sorry to hear that. I like Adrian. He's a good boss.
1141C080     //  Oh, please. Don't tell me you actually believe this jerk-off, Phelps.
9BFF0BE0     //  If Black is hurt, anything you give up might help us find him before it's too late.
DC7A0E37     //  Look, if something happened to Adrian then I am sorry to hear about that, 
48B3F820     //  but I don't know nothing more about it. 
40FC9414     //  I can't help you.
6E554842     //  I think you were in on it, Morgan. You drove down there and you let Black have it.
9CD1E52B     //  Ooh, I'm a bad boy? That the best you got?
296B16F3     //  You're lying, Morgan. You were there.
E5B45138     //  And you're talking out your ass, Detective. How about you prove that I was out at that railyard?
2568D154     //  Man can't have a quiet drink on his own anymore.
7D10E4CE     //  You were there, Morgan. We found a receipt in the trunk of the car. It has your name on it. We can call the slaughter yard and nail you on it.
5CBC9C29     //  Alright already. That fool Adrian's fallen for some dame in Seattle. He wanted me to make it look like he'd been attacked.
7B3D6B41     //  So Adrian isn't hurt? What's with all the blood?
6AF0FBF6     //  I don't know. It was dark... 
CDF07F7B     //  He must have caught a nick on something.
33B4A3C9     //  So, tell us what really happened.
B752DAE7     //  I drove with him out there. 
BF6E1998     //  Kind of moral support. 
AF609D00     //  We parked the car and Adrian left the glasses and the pipe. 
45A25C58     //  I took the trolley back here, and Adrian took off.
EE02F62E     //  We have you for aiding and abetting and criminal conspiracy. Do you want me to come up with some other charges, Morgan?
1AFACB3F     //  We bought a small hog and put it in the trunk. 
F8614F73     //  When we got to the railyard I cut the pig's throat and drained the blood into a bucket. 
62E4B4B5     //  I splashed the blood all round the car. 
FAFF7D6E     //  Adrian hit the pig a few times with the pipe to make the pipe look convincing.
5245CB74     //  You're lying, Morgan. You killed Black and hid the body. Where is it?
83ACA5E9     //  Me? All I did was help the fool. 
08E069F8     //  You're gonna need a lot more than that to prove I hurt him.
C9F77E04     //  I've had about enough of you two. How about you guys go find another table? Okay?
54FA5DFA     //  Where exactly is Black holed up?
94066A8E     //  No idea. I think he took off for Seattle.
C966D640     //  How is he getting there?
B5876C0B     //  I dunno, maybe a Greyhound? You guys ought to go try the terminal on Sunset.
5E8F6650     //  I'm tired of your shtick, Morgan. 
DAC5E50B     //  Spill it or we take you out in the alley and we knock it out of you.
B3528A62     //  He's holed up at my place. He's waiting for some money to come through before he blows town.
A4AD03DA     //  An address?
A4E2D9CA     //  It's an apartment house at the corner of Temple and Figueroa. Apartment number two.
5ACC561F     //  Lies, lies and more lies, Morgan. You know where he is.
8F170C1E     //  What have you got that says I know where he is?
6BB997DE     //  That's it for me, gentlemen. Over and out.
E215A078     //  Cuff him, let him go - it's up to you, Phelps. No way I'm writing this idiot up.
79BB9893     //  I think that's all. Thanks for your help, Morgan. We appreciate it.
2D331FC6     //  Hey - I'm just glad I could help. I love cops.
A7AC8CDF     //  This doesn't add up, Morgan. And your excuses don't help. Let's see how you enjoy the LAPD taking an interest in your life.
93CDD66A     //  Thanks, I'm glad we cleared that up.
FDA2BAEC     //  And I thought I'd get some privacy back here. Get lost, huh?
DBD10E11     //  Hey, mister? This is a drinking game for one. Leave me alone.
8A0D49E2     //  Hey, I'm a gold mine of information!
09E89734     //  Why would I give you anything more? You can never trust a cop.
43AEEE8F     //  I'll speak to a lawyer before I speak to you.
22B44707     //  Makes you a tough guy, does it?
00712B28     //  Cops! Always coming on with the rough stuff, then hiding behind a gun.
97F69DA1     //  Well, if it's all the same to you I'll go back to my drink.
EAE489D3     //  I thought cops had their own bars.
306B5D0D     //  I got drinking to do. You're getting nothing more from me.
EE5F2794     //  Alright, knucklehead. You're under arrest for conspiracy.
FDEC3A43     //  Hey - how about that break?
E84FE5A8     //  If it's a kidnapping, why leave the victim's ID? If it's a murder why leave the car? The evidence doesn't add up.
467D8532     //  Free lesson, Phelps. Evidence will only get you so far. You ask me, the whole thing feels hinky as hell.
45045656     //  What I wouldn't give to have your powers of intuition, Bekowsky.
438A55F8     //  Don't worry, kid. Keep watching the master and you'll get there one day.
6966A2DE     //  I've met some pretty good liars in my time. People who sound convincing because they actually believe their own bullshit. That type is clever, hard to catch out.
1C45C694     //  Frank Morgan is not one of those people.
919756F8     //  No, he is not.
C90B67E8     //  KGPL calling Car 11K. 11 King, come in.
FFAB08F5     //  11K, go ahead.
A151D0B7     //  Message from Technical Services: blood found in the abandoned Lincoln at the PE Freight Depot is not human. Repeat: not human. Compositional analysis reveals swine as most likely match.
080C43E8     //  Roger, KGPL. Time to reel this guy in, Phelps.
B299826F     //  Detective Phelps, badge twelve- forty-seven. I need an address for a Frank Morgan.
A3EA84A7     //  Just a second, Detective... Frank Morgan. Apartment building, corner of Temple and Figueroa. Apartment number two.
8DD930D6     //  I bet he wishes he rehearsed that story better now.
06255861     //  He sure left his drink in a hurry.
CFDA5CC9     //  Where are you taking us, Mr Morgan?
2A91B5AF     //  Day one in the big time and you're already tailing drunks home from bars. You having fun yet? I told you it was non-stop glamour working traffic, didn't I?
13452254     //  I'm just trying to learn.
5013003B     //  Oh, come on, Phelps. Save the creepy teacher's pet stuff for Leary. It won't work on me.
36E900FE     //  Alright, let's pay our friend a visit, see if he's missed us yet.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
EBA70909     //  Damn it. There's no way we'll be able to follow him home now.
5DE5B2C1     //  Apartment two.
2A721743     //  Help you, gentlemen?
4FD95C08     //  LAPD detectives, Mr Black. You're under arrest.
16C5A3DC     //  Look - I'm really sorry about this. 
0FF0124B     //  I never tried to hurt anyone. 
BB95AEC1     //  I just needed to get away from LA. 
F47CCC16     //  I won't put up a struggle. Just let me get my things...
1E5F652D     //  I knew it. Phelps, go after him! I'll try and head him off in the car. Remember - the gun is the last resort!
F1601FAD     //  Who the hell is that?
822CC2CC     //  Will you relax? Jesus, Adrian. I told you - we're in the clear. I'll get it.
3BBAA97A     //  Aw shit.
BBDF82C9     //  It's over, Morgan. Mr Black? LAPD! Give yourself up, now!
97F06CC3     //  Don't ask me what's going on here. I ain't got the first idea.
25DBFC05     //  Stop right there, Adrian!
9E4E75CF     //  Why not just come clean with her, Black? 
91701AD1     //  Why the melodrama?
18EDD9C6     //  I thought it would be easier.
2AC1D328     //  No, it just got a whole lot harder. 
2DCC8A71     //  Adrian Black - you're under arrest for conspiracy and fraud. 
506B426F     //  We'll see what the DA has to say about wasting police resources on a wild goose chase like this.
C3D9BD73     //  You're gonna lose your wife, lose your job and probably end up in the big house.

FA58DB39     //  You sure it was three Hispanics? 
5515ED27     //  Not some local kids you're looking out for?
30D47612     //  Hell, no. Little sons of bitches that live around here... 
86DF6547     //  I'd love to see them in Juvenile Hall. 
54D11A08     //  But you got your wires crossed, son.
EE9917E1     //  You're lying, Mr Jacobs. I think you're covering for someone.
41F2071A     //  Well, you must know something I don't.
0584BC4A     //  You've been standing out in the sun too long, boy.
0F64FA07     //  After the Mexicans left you didn't go anywhere near the car?
7F82B208     //  After I scared them off... no, I didn't go anywhere near that car.
DD056F5D     //  Can you describe the men?
5B90278C     //  Like I said, they were beaners.
E148B9ED     //  You went out to the car. Once they were gone, you had to take a look for yourself.
CAEC3348     //  I was curious. Ain't no law against that. So what if I took a look around that car? You can't be accusing me of nothing.
566217DB     //  How do you know there were three of them? It was dark. 
19136C0B     //  It must be fifty feet from the kitchen to the car.
18FFC8F6     //  You telling me I'm lying?
A50B235F     //  I was wearing my glasses. They had the headlights on. I'd say I was a dang sight more observant than you, son.
663F957D     //  Tell me about the car they were driving.
250D67CA     //  It was an old Ford. I didn't catch the license number.
A56D95E7     //  You look like the kind of guy who notices details.
1C115CCA     //  You're right there. The car was old but it looked brand new. Candy apple red paint job. Stands out a mile.
07BB9DE9     //  You gonna tell me what I want to know, or do I have to drag it out of you?
54319B69     //  You should learn to talk to older people with some manners, you son of a bitch.
7859E663     //  You were drunk and it was dark. What's with the smoke screen about the car, Jacobs?
D3C493AE     //  You got better information about that vehicle than I'm giving you, you better use it.
6FB4D6DF     //  I'm about done jawing with you thickheaded sons of bitches.
059403C7     //  What exactly did you see them take?
1C1A5827     //  They was working on the tires. 
9CBFAE18     //  That's all that was took.
55A303AD     //  Did you see them take anything else?
67E08CAA     //  Nope, I don't think so.
1906FBCF     //  Right. So what did you take, Jacobs? You want my partner to pat you down?
5EC5B5B0     //  I found a notebook in the glove compartment. 
1E1CDF13     //  I was going to show you. It's on the chair on my porch.
77BD2EBF     //  Why did you take the license plates?
84D865DC     //  Me? What would I do with license plates? You saying I have them?
FD9FC91D     //  Scratching around in that book won't prove nothing. You should show me some respect.
196EE0EE     //  That's all you're getting from me. Go blow a hose.
905C7C57     //  I ain't got nothing more to say to you.
2C64B3D3     //  Okay, so we have the owner of the vehicle. A degenerate.
2ABA34F2     //  I'll run John Madsen by R&I.
90CD58E5     //  Contact details on a William Dewey. This looks like business rather than pleasure.
5E4FE4FC     //  That all? I run those boys off for you... Ain't that worth something? You should ask me some real questions.
DB2BD1BB     //  Those no-account beaners used to own the whole of Los Angeles. But we ran 'em off. How about you get on with catching 'em?
9B3E6A22     //  I've done the right thing and answered all your questions. 
4B778D1D     //  Now quit sweating on me and go get those boys.
B8B1BB0A     //  Los Angeles' finest, huh? God help us all.
A358132E     //  Hey, I pay my taxes, so do some goddamned work.
3570615B     //  Thank you for your help, Mr Jacobs. You can speak to Officer Tabot about signing a formal statement.
73C05F72     //  When you get the car out of the way, maybe you could come back and do something about those kids?
C30E2C2F     //  How about we bring you an umpire's mask?
49467416     //  That's enough for now. 
3239A43C     //  Remember, Jacobs, it's an offense to obstruct a criminal investigation. 
0A2ED573     //  Let's hope you've given us everything.
943E061A     //  Gimme some room, huh? I have to get this done.
736A3D65     //  Hey - get outta the shot!
E8C44FE4     //  We'll follow up on the owner. Get a statement from Jacobs and I'll read your report back at the station.
B385366F     //  I think we've wrung this place dry. Let's find a gamewell.
B5F1B087     //  You coming? We need a gamewell, Phelps.
665AE629     //  Could you run the name 'Dewey Bros'? 
D023386D     //  Possibly a dealership or car mechanic's workshop.
04C6A21C     //  One moment... Dewey Bros Packard Dealership. 
533131A2     //  629 Figueroa Street.
E34F338F     //  Got it.
9E92E700     //  Messages, please.
ECDCF977     //  There's just one message for you, Detective. 
A502CF86     //  A four-door Packard, diplomatic license number Paul-Robert-Seven-Zero-Six was reported missing 
79D6EC92     //  this morning by a Juan Francisco Valdez.
AB32B91C     //  Could you have him brought in?
24F4C732     //  He's already here at Central, Detective. He's demanding an 'audience', as he calls it.
A5985C7D     //  Thanks. Can you get a message to Captain Leary? 
2F3DC614     //  Tell him we'll be in as soon as we can.
77A2F057     //  Can you put me through to MI 2458, please?
8BB6428A     //  Connecting you now.
EDAE6C43     //  Hello, can I help you?
C75F41E0     //  LAPD, ma'am. Can I speak to John Madsen please?
2B1BEB57     //  He's at school, Officer. What's this about? Is he in trouble?
EF434295     //  How old is your boy, ma'am?
57ADFA7B     //  Just turned sixteen.
9F138548     //  Wrong person, Mrs Madsen. Sorry to disturb you.
7BA50217     //  We can visit the Packard dealership, or head back to Central and interview this Valdez character. Your call.
A1C28BAD     //  You read the story in the Examiner about the Navy developing three dimensional movies?
D0AE4E39     //  What's a dimension?
FF075561     //  You know... like a graph. Vertical axis is Y and horizontal is X.
F2D59D69     //  Well, that's clear as mud!
66FA3FA9     //  Third dimension would be Z. So things would be popping out of the screen.
633B4D18     //  That's ridiculous. You'd scare people out of the theater. Who in God's name would want that?
94408D96     //  I don't know... 
AA8BC42C     //  people scoffed at the idea of talkies, and color. 
A0D7A2F8     //  And look what we have now.
78290567     //  Don't tell me, let me guess. 
C76F78C6     //  You were making your way past the lot, 
9C881678     //  caught sight of the new model four-door and couldn't help yourself. 
FE7EEA4F     //  You could see yourself in that car and just had to take a closer look. 
9C2AAF48     //  Well, I can't say as I blame you.
A4312068     //  LAPD, mac. We'd like to speak with the owner?
25FCF98E     //  That's me. William Dewey, proprietor, at your service.
3BFAC6BF     //  We're investigating the theft of a Packard belonging to the Argentine Embassy.
A4312068     //  LAPD, mac. We'd like to speak with the owner?
25FCF98E     //  That's me. William Dewey, proprietor, at your service.
3BFAC6BF     //  We're investigating the theft of a Packard belonging to the Argentine Embassy.
6371BBF6     //  Are you missing a combination wrench?
AC62D4A4     //  I don't know, Detective. But I know how we can find out. Follow me.
124E2FD5     //  We keep all our tools in here.
96AF7879     //  Mind if we look around?
5B5672D4     //  Be my guest.
B29BE50E     //  Gabriel Del Gado is missing a three quarter.
37FBF1C6     //  No good. We need diplomatic plates.
F0FF4C70     //  A wrench from this dealership was used to strip the wheels from a Packard last night, Mr Dewey. A couple of Hispanics were seen taking parts.
CBF0F715     //  We've had a spate of thefts ourselves. Comes with the location. Thieving bastards will steal anything the minute your back is turned.
227B7BC8     //  So that's it?
DEC6861F     //  Like I said - the workshop is too close to the street. It's difficult to keep an eye on it.
2ADFED81     //  What are you hiding, Dewey? Spill it. You don't want the LAPD getting too interested in this place.
01ADB3BC     //  So I hire a few illegals. 
4BE45D83     //  It's cheaper than hiring returning GIs, and they have less attitude. 
F173122D     //  Downside is, they're a little light-fingered.
C686B82F     //  Stop lying to me, Dewey. The thieves work for you.
D236A232     //  You can't prove that. Go ahead and try!
CF4F7CB1     //  Like I said - my tools get stolen on a regular basis. You don't want to believe me, I'm not going to say anymore.
93EE2E36     //  You have someone working here by the name of Gabriel, by any chance?
BDEC726F     //  Yeah, he used to work here. I had to let him go.
E03F86EA     //  Did Gabriel work on a '47 Packard with diplomatic plates?
B2775BEB     //  He may have done. I'd need to check to be sure.
B513F1CD     //  I think this Gabriel guy stole the car, and that he works for you. But I can stop being interested in him and get very interested in you, Dewey.
A7B9722B     //  Alright already. Gabriel Del Gado. He works here, the stupid son of a bitch. He's an illegal. Kid's been in trouble before, but he swore to me he'd left all of that behind. He was okay until Valdez said something to him and then he blew up. I thought the kid was going to kill him.
6A520870     //  You're running a racket here, Dewey. Selling cars and having your boys steal back parts.
95B0663A     //  That's outrageous. Parts are a waste of time. What stolen car parts can you pin on me?
A766261F     //  Packard delivers me five new cars a month and I have to shift them. I've got no time for nickel and dime stolen parts.
B5B31BDD     //  Packards are great cars, but this doesn't look like the kind of place favored by foreign embassies. 
00A5C3C9     //  How do you know Valdez?
51382CF1     //  I don't know Valdez. The Embassy bought the car. 
9309858B     //  All I know is, he must know a quality car when he sees one.
8F1E1C10     //  So Valdez was just driving by and he saw the car?
A535CAC0     //  Yeah, something like that. Happens all the time.
31BF69C6     //  I've had just about enough of you, Dewey. What's the angle with Valdez?
AB85CEEE     //  The embassy bought the car. 
19731B1B     //  When it comes in for service Valdez picks it up. 
2A90C15B     //  That's it.
CF8F93C6     //  And I know a shyster when I see one. You and Valdez are in this together.
415D7B62     //  Me and Valdez? I hardly know him. Valdez wouldn't wipe his shoes with me.
4DA49657     //  Huh? Are you even writing any of this down in that little book?
D1DF90F5     //  We found your contact details in Valdez's notebook. He had to be calling you for something, Dewey.
90E92B64     //  Okay. So, I met Valdez in a bar. 
0872821E     //  We cut a deal and he bought the car through the Embassy. 
A2316B94     //  I cut him some change on the side. It happens all the time.
94A3792C     //  Where can we find Del Gado?
933A8270     //  I don't know. He sure as hell isn't here.
870D84D1     //  So you don't know where the kid lives?
689BA198     //  He got kicked out of his last place. He might be at his girlfriend's, but I don't know where that is.
34144B54     //  Address, Dewey. Or my partner shoves your head in a car door.
D0D9C912     //  Okay, alright! 
96CF4916     //  Apartment three, 103 Hill Street. 
0116B5A2     //  And tell him from me - 
D1761235     //  if he ever shows his face around here again I'm gonna kick his butt from here to kingdom come.
073E6896     //  You're lying. You've got him holed up somewhere.
16037F2B     //  I'm having nothing to do with that kid and you can't prove any different.
14322F6A     //  That kid's temper is like a time bomb. I want nothing more to do with him or you.
EF922C5E     //  I've got cars to sell. I'm not wasting any more hot air on you guys.
C8F77934     //  I'm done talking. You boys should run along now.
BEA26043     //  Thank you for your help, Mr Dewey. You might need to come down to Central Station to sign a statement.
794EA0C5     //  I got cars to sell. Can't you get someone to bring it around?
E44305E6     //  Look, shitbird - do what the man tells you. We clear on that?
0B700F5E     //  Perfectly. Can I get on with my life now?
185E0804     //  We'll be keeping an eye on you, Dewey, 
88E5FC7E     //  and spreading the word that you don't like to cooperate with the LAPD.
3976BFE8     //  I need to screen my employees better. You've gotta know who you can trust.
326EF281     //  You sure you guys aren't interested in a new car? Hmmm. Maybe a used car? I have some nice used cars for guys in your wage bracket.
9CEA61C4     //  Hey, don't be too hasty. Can I interest you in a new Packard, Detective?
C21066C7     //  Stop and have a look around. That new coupe in Algiers Blue sure looks good...
118ABCD0     //  Boys, if you have nothing to do I have a few cars you could wash. How does ten cents a car sound?
78576E50     //  If you boys are going to stand around all day, maybe you could black some tires.
0829A8F0     //  Thank you for your help, Mr Dewey.
4C5C5438     //  No problem. Goddamn that kid. 
59168509     //  I'm just an honest car salesman. 
19526B99     //  Seems like you just don't know who you can trust these days.
225BD0D8     //  Go into movies, Dewey. You're missing your calling.
7DF89388     //  You know, I drive this very model myself. Yes I do.
4E695422     //  If you're here to buy, I am your man. 
81EFAEEB     //  Otherwise you're wasting my time.
1BBB42F4     //  If you don't mind I got cars to wash.
4726B720     //  Mr Dewey sees me talking to you he's going to dock my pay.
A8C047F2     //  Hey, which wiseacre used the half- inch and didn't replace it?
753EA5BB     //  I bet a broad's been driving this auto. The clutch is a mess.
46AAF34A     //  Whoa! Hold your horses, there. Step into my office, son, we'll sign some papers. Then that baby's yours.
61F863E0     //  We're done here. Let's speak to Valdez back at the station.
AC174398     //  Car 11K, Car 11 King, come in.
FFAB08F5     //  11K, go ahead.
B65C0BE7     //  Car 11K, go to Central Station. Person of Interest ready for interview.
1D6A3A7A     //  11K, roger.
B80C2F46     //  Check in with the Watch Commander, Phelps. At the front desk.
58912BD7     //  Do we have a Juan Francisco Valdez in for questioning?
2D652003     //  Sure do, Phelps. Your bird is in Interview Two. And get this, he's wearing gloves and doing his best not to touch anything. Can you beat that?
72089BAD     //  I'm kinda busy here, fellas. Move it along.
9C7A2E63     //  Get that interview over and done with, and get that whining son of a bitch out of my station.
D1C2DE42     //  Sounds like we don't want to keep this guy waiting. It's this way.
7886A52F     //  About time. Are you the senior officer I requested?
B49866A8     //  I'm Detective Phelps and this is Detective Bekowsky.
ED1606AD     //  Have you any idea how long I have been waiting to speak with you? I am needed back at the Consulate and you keep me here like a common criminal.
EB949ABD     //  Alright, friend. Let's take a deep breath and start all over again.
EE53E178     //  Mr Valdez...
184E1CE4     //  Consul General. I insist on my full title.
D4E7706B     //  Consul General, we have located your car. 
9C1FAA8E     //  Can you tell us how it was stolen?
57BCDBBC     //  It must have been stolen from the Consular garage. 
390FFF37     //  Terribly inconvenient, of course. 
E6134C4F     //  I want the perpetrator soundly flogged.
AD7D5068     //  Unfortunately we don't do that here, Your Worship.
08720E58     //  You didn't use the car last night?
5D081FEF     //  For dinner, yes. But it was back in the garage by nine.
78AE88D7     //  You have a pretty good idea who stole the car, don't you, Consul General? 
81C4C281     //  Are you going to tell me or do I shake it out of you?
4B0EC346     //  There's no call for violence. I suspect a disgruntled boy from the car dealership.
DB19AB69     //  You have a name for this kid?
99D65378     //  Gabriel. Like the archangel. I have no surname.
05DE9DB2     //  I think you know who stole the car and why they stole it, Valdez.
931E59E1     //  How dare you! If I was a younger man I would demand satisfaction. What evidence do you have that links me to the thief?
B22DA6A4     //  An apology is in order before I will continue.
E138EEF3     //  So tell us about this kid, Gabriel. 
3C287569     //  You had a run in with him?
4AB2B28B     //  Mecánico. A presumptuous young man who did not know his place. He presumed to ask me questions.
A174A392     //  We do a lot of presuming here in the United States, Consul General. It comes with the turf.
3373FFA7     //  Had you met the kid before?
2C173B9D     //  I have seen him when the car was previously serviced. He was not impertinent enough to address me on that occasion.
C33366D2     //  So a Consul General gets in a public row with a junior car mechanic? You expect me to believe that's all that happened?
BF5D3D06     //  I expect you to draw your own conclusions and to discontinue this aggressive behavior.
377DE8EF     //  You fuck young boys, Valdez?
BF9EE502     //  Are you a madman? This will cause an international incident!
487E6878     //  When I leave here I will seek legal advice from my government, Detective. And then I will bring your Police Department to its knee.
2B2EB3ED     //  Danny, Ben, Miguel, Tristan and Teddy. Full lips, ring any bells?
F0036797     //  I'm sure we can come to some arrangement?
E590F633     //  Gabriel. Spill it.
08CD30F7     //  A beautiful but impertinent boy. 
69FA2056     //  I mentioned a rendezvous and the young man went quite insane. I thought he was going to kill me. 
B44BC8D6     //  I was prepared to pay.
F78ED710     //  Where did you purchase the car?
132A2633     //  My secretary and driver arranged the purchase. 
0254A0C9     //  A disreputable place - Dewey Brothers by name. 
6ADCE981     //  As soon as I can have it arranged I will have my Hispano Suiza brought up from Buenos Aires.
2028A6EB     //  Dewey Brothers. 
D3D3792D     //  Do you think someone from the garage could have been involved in the theft?
E29EE956     //  It would not surprise me in the least.
7E3C07D5     //  You bought a Packard, Valdez? A snob like you doesn't drive an American car. I want answers or I'll smack you around the teeth.
1E71F98A     //  William Dewey offered me a substantial bribe to make a purchase at his establishment. 
4716C954     //  It is not unusual to make this kind of transaction in the civil service.
3E7647A7     //  Tell that to the Argentine taxpayers.
7ED3C065     //  You're lying, Valdez. You made the arrangements for the car.
C39B1BFB     //  Call the embassy. I decided the color and model but was not involved in the transaction.
24B95296     //  Ya basta! I will stand no more of this.
A102C7AF     //  Your questions are futile. I refuse to answer them.
F7049737     //  I am a diplomat, and I have immunity. I will answer no more of your questions.
B665CC0C     //  We'll be in touch, Consul General.
0E81DC6C     //  I'll be talking to the Gangster Squad about you, Valdez. They're going to love your diary.
B14DA76E     //  No more questions. 
84944998     //  I am late for an important engagement. 
96C33C05     //  When will you deliver my automobile?
A33FF847     //  Gentlemen, your duty is simple. Return my automobile and thrash the perpetrators.
5262347B     //  Where are you going? You have not been dismissed.
B1467ADB     //  Are you sure that you are in possession of all of the facts?
02EDA327     //  You, señor, remind me of my cousin Jose, who was kicked in the head by a polo pony. We shot the pony, but we probably should have shot poor Jose instead.
E773E27A     //  Attention!
78CE02B4     //  I need an address on a Dewey Brothers Packard Dealership.
B2B576EA     //  One moment, Detective... Dewey Brothers Packard Dealership. 629 Figueroa Street. Owner is a William Dewey.
674D0670     //  We're finished with Valdez.

B2B2E711     //  Nearly twenty weeks.
9A152F8E     //  Right. So how's it gonna be when you go into labor and he's not around?
B9EB644F     //  You are wrong about Gabriel. He will be a good father. Already he works hard to provide for us.

320A9665     //  He was here last night. 
1ECC2585     //  I have never seen him so angry. 
C97601F7     //  He went out to his shed and put some things in it. 
538A6303     //  I don't know what and I don't want to know.

21F66379     //  Gabriel wasn't at work. Where can we find him?
1B23B98D     //  He said he would never go back. Gabriel is out driving around in his car.
D5D8538F     //  If you tell us where he is, I will try and bring him in. If we have to track him down ourselves it could end very badly for him, Miss Rodriguez.
D4875F64     //  He is out with his chivatos. Julian and Enrique. They race on the corner of First and Santa Fe. I have pleaded with Gabriel to stop, but he would not listen.

1E06844C     //  I can't tell you anymore.
9A405F7B     //  You're lying, Anna. I think he's somewhere in the building.
CEBF5FEC     //  What makes you say he is here? If he was here he would come out and not endanger his baby.
321DF177     //  No more. You are a hateful and cruel man.
EF4C7FAE     //  Why did he steal the car, Anna?
D2B15F09     //  The customer insulted him. He has his honor, no?
3F75C749     //  His honor, Anna?
BFD17316     //  He said Dewey's friend tried to make a woman out of him. He no longer respects this man Dewey. He took the car to show this maricón that he is a man.
C9A5E178     //  Gabriel's been in trouble before. He's left you here alone to answer for him, and you expect me to believe that his motive was honor?

CEE924FA     //  You must ask these questions of Gabriel. 
EE34A9CA     //  I know nothing of these car parts.
69DB793A     //  You want him home as much as we do, Anna. Tell us where we can find him.
7DCB6493     //  You pretend to be concerned for me, but you would take him straight from here to a cell.
99A8EC75     //  Then tell us where he is. If your baby is born in prison, Anna, the corrections officers will take it from you. You'll see your son or daughter through a metal grate for half an hour a week.
F0EB4C8D     //  The start line is on First and Santa Fe. There is a spillway under the bridge that leads to the river. Many policia have wrecked trying to follow him.

8F7F2D84     //  What proof do you have that I stole the cars?
321C0D6D     //  You come into my house to insult and bully me. I have known many policía like you.
EAD8F489     //  We will put in a good word for you, Anna. As far as we're concerned, this sits with Gabriel.
431B64EB     //  As soon as we corner Gabriel we'll be back for you, Anna. You had your chance to cooperate.
7D14325E     //  Gabriel promised me.

505142DC     //  He's a good man, you have to believe me.
9385A135     //  Please leave. You have what you need.
ED8FB63A     //  You must give me a chance to speak.

CFD21E49     //  Yes, something like that.
4676988A     //  You're making me angry, Miss Galletta. Is that what you want?
0FB911F0     //  Tell me why Mr Kalou shot Mr Gage.
3DD28717     //  Mr Gage hates Jews. A lot of people do. It's not my fault if he has nice things.
344AA6A4     //  I think you're trying to pin this thing on this Kalou character. I think you were angry with Mr Gage and you shot him.
BB2AF645     //  You think that? You're a madman. I don't know about guns. You can't prove I own a gun!
19A0237E     //  I've told you all I know. I think you should leave me alone.
E083E582     //  How many shots did you hear, Miss Galletta?
8E57CB40     //  It's difficult to remember... it sounded like there were so many, and they were so loud...
3EC84C30     //  I need you to concentrate, Miss Galletta. Even minor details can become important later on.
993D9280     //  Well, there was one bang, and then another... and then three very quickly, close together. Five.
82066BA6     //  You have something of a selective memory, Miss Galletta. That won't endear you to any police officers I know.
B4FF1A5E     //  How can you say that? I want to help, Officer, really. 
16F6A3B5     //  But it's all just a blur in my head.
F4B3D429     //  Don't lie to me. If you keep withholding information, I'm going to take you in for obstruction of justice.
0DEAFC65     //  I'm trying my best, Officer. I've got nothing to hide. What makes you think different?
7906CCE0     //  I was scared, alright? Are you happy now? I was terrified, and the last thing on my mind was keeping count.
113DF780     //  I suppose I must look a mess.
F5C6FBD2     //  If you'll excuse me, I'd better get the store closed up.
644BE42B     //  Wait! That isn't everything! You haven't got it all.
670C9911     //  Why are you just staring at me like that? I've done nothing wrong!
EF6983CA     //  Thank you for your help, ma'am, you've been very brave. We'll need you to make a formal statement about what happened to Mr Gage.
A9A14048     //  Does that mean I can still collect my... my... never mind. Yes, Officer, I'll make a statement.
62D3CDB5     //  A man is dead, Miss Galletta. And it's a criminal offence to lie to a police officer. I ought to take you Downtown.
38572D83     //  Get out! Get out, right now! Send in one of the other policemen if you must, but I won't say another word to you!
E80FB82F     //  We have the murder weapon.
1C5EB7C3     //  And the murderer. The girl saw it all. Our killer works at a jewelry store called Hartfield's.
00641843     //  That's a couple of blocks from here.
9EC8DE37     //  You thinking what I'm thinking?
FDB74DC1     //  Tate. Maintain the perimeter.
0A3AFC43     //  We have the murder weapon?
C6F9B337     //  But no murderer. The girl saw it all, but she clammed up on me. We could trace the gun.
64540078     //  Eagleson's gun store is a couple of blocks from here.
9EC8DE37     //  You thinking what I'm thinking?
6D936F11     //  Officers. What can I do you for?
172952DE     //  Officers Phelps and Dunn, sir. Wilshire Division. We need you to trace a serial number.
8DD6805D     //  Sure. What's the make and model?
DB61A704     //  FN Browning, Model 1922. The serial number is 01138.
25C9DEAB     //  You don't say? Well, I didn't sell it. Europeans love them, but it's pretty rare you find one over here. Although I did have one in here couple of weeks back.
07478777     //  You remember the owner?
E1C42D8B     //  Yeah, Kalou. Edgar Kalou was his name. 
4D4B2A2D     //  The thing looked like it had never been fired, but he brought it in here for cleaning anyway. 
3DA3192C     //  Then he bought a box of cartridges and he left.
D1134F6E     //  Do you know where we can find Mr Kalou?
675B22EB     //  Told me he was on his lunch break. Said he worked at Hartfield's, jewelry store just up on Broadway.
7916701E     //  Thanks for your help.
72980E0A     //  Don't know what else I can tell you, Officer. Gun wasn't one of mine. Ain't no market here for those goofy looking Brownings.
A25E9C42     //  All I can say is in the end, it's the guy pulling the trigger who's responsible.
A0B84D6A     //  Hey, Officer? I thought you came in here looking for my help.
B55D878E     //  Officer, can I interest you in a new watch?
8A4F7C59     //  Officer Cole Phelps. Are you Edgar Kalou?
33ADD504     //  Ah... no. Mr Kalou is out back. He said he had to lie down. I'll buzz him for you.
84DC4845     //  Son of a bitch. Go, Cole, go!
1FB205F6     //  Kalou! Get back here!
102F7786     //  Too late, Kalou!
F6611258     //  Don’t make it worse, Kalou!
75A84DE1     //  Edgar Kalou, you're under arrest for the murder of Everett Gage.
14AABFC4     //  We want to trace the gun, right? Let's get to Eagleson's.
0827C071     //  Without a witness we're gonna need help tracking down our shooter, Cole. Back to the gun store.
13821CB9     //  Ask the guy about that serial number.
B7AB0586     //  Hartfield's. It's up on Broadway, Cole, come on.
45733549     //  No way can we let this Hartfield's tip slide. Let's go back.
39DFCF37     //  You do the talking, Cole. Play it cool.
A0BEF907     //  The case that makes you and the case that breaks you. 
5D3B5D2B     //  The one you never solve, the one that keeps you 
D145CCDF     //  awake at night. 
A2053FCF     //  The case that gnaws at your guts and ruins your marriage. 
21F7905E     //  The case that keeps you propping up a bar as you relive 
FFC9D4AF     //  the what-ifs, the might-have-beens, 
1AADB4A3     //  the half-leads and the half-truths. 
344364F6     //  The case that other cops murmur about whenever you walk past. 
B60F09AF     //  The case you never ever discuss.
F1E21079     //  God's mill may grind slowly, but it grinds finely, son. 
C1520BAD     //  I hear it's you who nabbed our malefactor from the shooting yesterday?
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
80378EE0     //  Then tell me, boyo - I hear you're quite the climber, a man of initiative. 
983AF9F6     //  How would you like a chance at smiting this man with the sword of justice?
A4A4D722     //  You're asking me to conduct the interview, sir?
1702FF3F     //  I am, young Phelps. 
792B3A08     //  You've only been with us a short time and you've assembled yourself a stellar arrest record. 
30A375E7     //  Not to mention the fine work you did in the war sending heathens back to the hell they came from. 
E40E52A7     //  But I'm curious as to whether you can turn your hand to interrogation. 
6AB30C55     //  Takes a certain animal cunning, lad. 
02C4A19E     //  Do you think you might be ready for that?
972879CB     //  Yes, sir. I think I am.
63EEEA1D     //  Good man.
6AC72491     //  You need many things for a conviction, young Phelps. 
B066493D     //  A motive, opportunity, hard evidence, and best of all, a confession. 
CA33FA46     //  If you fail in the former you can always use a modicum of violence to obtain the latter. 
82B1E37A     //  How are you feeling, lad?
61B4C999     //  Fine, sir.
B4169C08     //  Very good.
D88D0315     //  The evidence is overwhelming. May the cat eat him and the cat be eaten by the devil.
0093EDB9     //  Bring me a confession, young Phelps.
9C405943     //  This is your chance. Don't fail me.
CF1CCA64     //  Has my lawyer arrived yet? I want to see my lawyer.
ACBD3B41     //  A lawyer can't help you, Mr Kalou. You shot a man dead in cold blood. You're going to have to pay for that.
053A130C     //  Let's talk about the shooting. Do you deny shooting Everett Gage?
568F5CD1     //  I'm a businessman. I run a jewelry store. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sure my lawyer can clear all this up.
BA47F533     //  Come on, Mr Kalou. Make this easy on yourself. Get it off your conscience.
41321FAC     //  You think I'm stupid. You think I'll just do whatever you want because you're a nice guy.
3977D714     //  You blew a man out of his socks over an empty grudge, you son of a bitch. Do you think I have sympathy for you?
9B08F14E     //  That's the way. Keep needling me. Try the rough stuff and my lawyer will be making an official complaint.
E16BFB51     //  You deny owning a Browning pistol, serial number 01138?
F656AF69     //  I owned a gun, yes. But it was stolen in a burglary a couple of years ago. You can't prove I used my gun on Gage.
78AA2C52     //  Gage was an asshole, but his death wasn't down to me.
980237C7     //  You had the gun cleaned and you bought a new box of ammunition. The store owner remembers you and where you worked.
D59950B5     //  Is that so? 
6E10E041     //  It's amazing what the nebbishes will recall when it suits them.
0F697EC1     //  You followed Everett Gage and the girl back to the shoe store. You put five rounds in Gage's back.
16E2D1F2     //  Gage was a bastard. 
634FAEB4     //  Whatever he got, he got what was coming. 
5C42CC3A     //  But it had nothing to do with me.
8D913800     //  I don't know why I'm bothering to try to help you here, Mr Kalou. 
5F40A408     //  I could stand in front of the Grand Jury and say that you showed no remorse - 
A58202AC     //  the defendant is a cold blooded killer.
036F0ABF     //  Very good, boychik. Kiss my ass. 
387C37DB     //  I know what you're doing. 
EEF25BDC     //  I think I'll wait for my lawyer to get here before I make any kind of statement.
700F2363     //  So you shot this guy over the sale of a watch?
26D48536     //  You think Jewish people are going to continue to take it lying down? 
0431FBD8     //  Straight and orderly lines to the ovens? 
852384B6     //  Not this hebe. I say enough is enough. No more.
087B9276     //  You shot Gage, and we know why. We can put you at the scene.
EFE386DC     //  You can't prove anything.
BB88C754     //  You've got nothing, boychik. You're going to be laughed right out of court.
6098091E     //  We know all about the argument. Miss Galletta made a statement.
0CA9510D     //  You're counting on the girl? You think her testimony is gonna stand up in court?
883EB929     //  You're going to the gas chamber, Edgar.
63516015     //  That Jew-hating fuck couldn't leave me alone... I had a sale... that girl was ready to buy...
64891153     //  Let's change the subject. You fasting for Yom Kippur, Mr Kalou?
ED343FF9     //  Yeah, let's change the subject, you goy motherfucker. How about baseball?
15BBE865     //  You're not denying you're a Jew, Mr Kalou?
3C3E576E     //  This is America, it's not Germany. It's not a crime.
5A4EACF7     //  Some people don't like Jews, Mr Kalou.
C7239495     //  Yeah, and I guess you're one of them.
6ABD0068     //  Gage hated Jews, didn't he, Mr Kalou?
E430773C     //  I don't know what you're talking about.
4D8BE99A     //  Gage was a Jew hater. Get it off your chest.
FC716B30     //  Gage and his kind are pathetic.
8C40A3BB     //  You left-wing-leaning parasite. You expect me to sit here and listen to your drivel?
451DE7F3     //  You call me that? You sit there and you call me those names? You goddamned goy putznasher! You and that schtup Gage!
E156E280     //  Why did you do it, Mr Kalou?
BD3EE8F0     //  Gage - he's in the Chamber of Commerce. He's in with all those momzers. He blocked every proposal I ever put forward. Kike this and kike that. He's been trying to ruin my business for years!
F79461E6     //  You're lying, Kalou. I think you lent Gage money and he owed you payment.
E430773C     //  I don't know what you're talking about.
55C3554C     //  I'm done with you. Go flap your gums somewhere else. I want my lawyer.
18A521A0     //  I got nothing more to say to a goy piece of shit like you.
EA746CD5     //  You just remember, soon as my lawyer gets here I'm walking out.
A23BFDB7     //  Didn't I ask for a lawyer? Shouldn't you be on the phone, Officer?
470F15F2     //  I've just got to keep my mouth shut and watch you run around in circles. We're done, unless you want to keep making a schmuck of yourself.
AB59967D     //  Edgar Kalou, I'm charging you with the first degree murder of Everett Gage. 
4A68CB58     //  I respect your beliefs and your right to hold them. 
772C13BF     //  I hope for your sake the jury can commute to murder in the second degree. 
4D1627A9     //  May God have mercy on you, sir.
89022093     //  You disappoint me, Cole Phelps.
E06F7A22     //  Get back in there and raise some lumps, boy. 
1708DE69     //  I need a confession.
E23F1697     //  Masterfully done, Officer Phelps. It is just 'Officer' Phelps, isn't it, lad?
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
F1C58175     //  Then let me have a word with the Chief of Police, young Phelps. The department needs heroes. A shining honest face the public can admire. I applaud a man with your talent for unwavering justice. Back to your duties for now, boyo. But here's a piece of advice - get yourself two suits, get them pressed. You'll be needing them.
F3D141F6     //  Looks like there’s something in this trash can.
8BE37FA0     //  We should go back to the shoe store. There has to be something we missed.
09029ECD     //  What did I tell you about going too hard on the witness? She's a store assistant, not a prisoner of war.
78DF1B2F     //  Is that supposed to be funny?
6B8D074D     //  I'm just saying that sometimes you need to pour some sugar on these broads. A little bedside manner can go a long way.
7FFFF3DE     //  And since when are you the expert? We got the murder weapon, didn't we?
451411E4     //  You shouldn't dole it out if you can't take it, Phelps. She was a looker, though, tell me I'm wrong.
4D102DFA     //  No wonder you're suddenly so obsessed with bedside manner.
87D64E71     //  We're on a roll here. Detective Dunn. Nice ring to it, don't you think?
9370A9CF     //  I can't stop thinking about Floyd Rose's name being in that book at Schroeder's apartment.

42760C55     //  What are you thinking, Ray?
6E068AB1     //  The city keeps tossing us dead bodies. We're just running to catch up.
E7043A93     //  There's more work to do here, Phelps. Leave me be.
A52EAA33     //  I've got no more for you.
41ECAA4C     //  You want to leave me alone so I can get some work done? Go play in front of the trains.
4AAFFEC1     //  Stay out of my way, and I will stay out of yours. 
D5976370     //  Everybody's happy.
9628E256     //  The witnesses, Detective. They have the information you're after.
E98E5D80     //  My job is to secure the crime scene. 
508C19F5     //  You need to review the evidence and speak to the witnesses.
26CF1E2A     //  Hey, how about getting the full report?
EF45B3A5     //  Mal.
9C8BEF22     //  You guys took your time.
85F84887     //  Detective Phelps and Galloway, Homicide. Can you tell me exactly what happened?
FC573C19     //  We were shunting cars over to the main line when I saw this man here lying on top of this woman. The woman wasn't moving and seemed to be in a bad way.
3A5B3AF9     //  What time was this?
8F4B57AA     //  About seven thirty this morning, sir.
16DE25A2     //  Thanks for your help. Have you given Patrolman Hart your details?
5FD2AF72     //  I have, sir.
79641138     //  Thank you. You can go now.
7ED0537E     //  You should talk to that man. See what he has to say for himself.
DB06AF70     //  Something funny about that man, sir.
4A4CD437     //  There's more, sir, if you're here to listen.
44774B36     //  Detective Phelps. LAPD Homicide.
CCE63C58     //  John Ferdinand Jamison.
ED98C73D     //  We need you to answer some questions, John.
86C3EBF9     //  If you don't mind, I prefer Ferdinand.
0ECBABDB     //  Don't push your luck, knucklehead.
4E49C3BD     //  You found the body?
9F944914     //  Yes, I did. I work here. 
76EDFFC8     //  I was coming off shift and headed home.
C9FA798B     //  You just came across the body?
C4CD9392     //  Yes. That's exactly what happened.
8E1FE8A8     //  Why didn't you report the body, Jamison? Do you know how this is going to look to a jury?
E0252ECD     //  A jury? What gives? I could tell that she was dead. 
317596DA     //  I came through here about midnight last night, she wasn't here then.
ECC44D9D     //  Let me belt him again.
6D48CC1D     //  You're lying, Jamison. 
EB036A5E     //  I think you lured this poor woman out here and killed her.
DF813685     //  You're crazy. What makes you say I killed her?
44FA1598     //  Live women really aren't my thing.
09B485C0     //  Shut up. Just shut up or you're gonna get it again.
0F09D69B     //  What were you doing to the body, Ferdinand?
8E9BCFDE     //  Are you sure you won't be upset?
60C9FC81     //  Try me, Ferdinand.
1DE28159     //  I was kissing her...
53A5E1C8     //  It's not against the law! There's no law against it.
23E1880B     //  Shut up and take your beating like a man.
87E563D3     //  Turn out your pockets, Ferdinand.
E351E8FB     //  Classic Carmine.
D25C6860     //  Is this yours, Ferdinand?
9531DFCB     //  No. I found it near her purse. 
47A96F8B     //  I thought she could use some lipstick.
CD5A108F     //  Rusty, stop. Don't hit him.
B8E86F3A     //  You went through her purse?
8FB85990     //  It wasn't like she needed it. I took a look.
BACC9B6E     //  Did you take any money?
87131272     //  Wasn't any to take. 
D75AF809     //  I found her lipstick and her matchbook over on the mat. Not much else.
0F9E6C40     //  You found her lipstick. 
B4F93162     //  What did you write on her body?
485B25B6     //  What are you talking about? I didn't write anything.
3B86D16C     //  So you kill women and interfere with them. That's your MO, Jamison?
5F0E40B2     //  I know some people might find what I do unusual, but I don't kill people. How can you prove that I killed this woman?
5714CE8B     //  I'd like to go if you're quite finished.
6D20E03C     //  You're under arrest, Jamison. We'll see how this plays out. Until then, you can think a little on how you'd like to be treated if you were found dead.
681B202F     //  I'm telling you it's not illegal! Me and some friends of mine...
EAB7B2A1     //  Clyde, can you get this sack of shit into a cell? I'll deal with him later.
C2906918     //  Sure, Rusty.
AD654E06     //  Come on, Officer. You gotta give me a proper chance to explain.
D4217EC0     //  Keep that crazy partner of yours off me!
168AABFF     //  I know it seems weird at first. But over time...
3CEC87B4     //  Quit staring at me like I'm some kind of freak.
ECD76BD0     //  No more questions. You put the book away and get a leash on your goddamn partner.
AC6D4D72     //  We could go over to the lot and see what they know about her.
0B9C58B1     //  That's going to be difficult, Cole. 
40CC4B5B     //  The Keystone Studio lot closed back in '41.
505CD739     //  This is a chit for personal items, not booze. It's an angle worth investigating.
1BBD6F7F     //  There should be a gamewell or a phone somewhere. See if you can get an address on the liquor store.
7EF6DE06     //  I need an address on Levine's Liquor. Closest store to the Santa Fe Avenue railyard, if possible.
A531D532     //  Just a moment, Detective... closest store would be the one at 939 South Hope Street.
6FBD1459     //  You read that those goddamn Chinese want to sell the relief food that we're sending them?
B54243DD     //  Yeah, yeah, I read about that.
10BA778E     //  Those people are starving. They can't do that.
E0234D76     //  They want to sell the food to fund the civil war against the communists.
66BB075F     //  Really? I guess that's okay then.
24FF6E5E     //  Armies can't fight without food. 
E96FBBC8     //  You can spend all your money on weapons but you still have to have the will to fight. 
9F5F1169     //  Unfortunately, the Reds will win in China.
F247F8F1     //  Watch your mouth. Do you know what you're saying?
CB66867C     //  The people of this country overthrew a king. 
9A8998D4     //  Do you think the Chinese will balk at an Emperor if they are starving?
3092D794     //  Drink, fellas?
4798A75D     //  Phelps, Galloway. Homicide. We need to ask you some questions concerning Evelyn Summers.
9F2D443A     //  I'm Walter Mensch. Evelyn Summers? What is it now?
082142DE     //  You knew Evelyn?
078DE60B     //  As well as I wanted to know Evelyn. She's a pain in the ass. Always coming in here, cadging drinks. Never had any money. She was in just a couple of nights ago.
5E93D215     //  Did she ever tell you where she was staying?
63362096     //  I don't know. I think she was living rough. She had that kind of shtunk about her.
CD5781A6     //  Who did she drink with?
CB161C86     //  A bunch of these guys. Ask around.
F4CC0108     //  The regulars might have something else to tell you, but I don't.
81836DCF     //  You're free to speak to the regulars, just don't shake them too hard.
B8BB048E     //  I thought you wanted to talk.
C9DA728B     //  You a friend of Evelyn Summers?
B5A5C072     //  Who's asking?
01F1CE11     //  Very cute. You know who's asking.
AD9CA4A2     //  I know my rights.
773D84F5     //  You don't have any. Answer the question.
09B526CD     //  Evelyn mooches for drinks. I don't have any time for that.
A00EA1C0     //  Was that so hard?
8613D845     //  Keep riding me, copper.
B7B1EF6C     //  Looks like trying to enjoy a quiet drink is against the goddamn law now, huh?
9F9AE28F     //  One more time, pal, and I'll break your fucking jaw.
3330B08C     //  That's it. Keep walking.
57D75928     //  What's your name?
EA139A54     //  Grosvenor McCaffrey.
5E502D79     //  Mind if I ask you some questions, Mr McCaffrey?
08E797FC     //  I'm just a starving writer, Detective. 
13220E78     //  What do you want to ask about?
77DA83A6     //  Evelyn Summers. And why she was found beaten and strangled in the rail depot on Santa Fe.
6F0547A8     //  Okay, I see your point.
61800746     //  How well did you know her?
B34BEE49     //  I can't say that I knew her. It was more like I was aware of her.
CADFA5EA     //  Did you see Evelyn last night?
9337ABB1     //  No. I was at home. Writing.
3A73631C     //  Can anyone corroborate that?
DC280DC8     //  Good choice of word. Am I a suspect?
3D812C8F     //  Do you want to get dragged into this, McCaffrey? Do you want us to get interested in you?
72F5BC0C     //  She hung out with this powder puff, James Tiernan. They haunted the public library together.
5768A9F8     //  How well do you know James Tiernan?
A961D08F     //  I know he works some kind of plebeian job at Rawling's Bowling Alley.
EF40F9BD     //  I think you're lying, McCaffrey. You saw Evelyn last night.
ED39D006     //  Unless you're some kind of oracle I think you're going to have a hard time proving that, Detective.
81F14131     //  I've been helpful. I think it's time you and your colleague ran along.
53E241EE     //  If you don't mind? 
F7F7B504     //  I'm trying to grasp a very elusive thought.
822B96D3     //  At the moment, all I want to do is talk to the bottom of my glass.
9605B166     //  Back here. I've not said my piece yet.
7AB162B2     //  You guys got somewhere you need to be? You're ruining the ambiance.
473CA265     //  Haven't you got parking tickets to hand out?
836D4A32     //  This interview is over.
A712B842     //  Do you have a criminal record, Mr McCaffrey?
F01CC080     //  Nothing serious. I've had a few skirmishes.
E7E864E5     //  But nothing reprehensible?
82EC746F     //  No. The odd parking ticket - that kind of thing.
B5B1A53E     //  Do you want to save me some time, or do you want me to look up your file?
FE0BA20B     //  Industrial disputes, strikes. Worker's rights. That kind of thing.
7818E63D     //  A regular fifth columnist. Nice to meet you, Comrade.
0CC5D651     //  How about murder, McCaffrey? 
72314F08     //  You ever been involved in a murder before?
682807C6     //  If I'm carrying the Mark of Cain you're gonna need something to prove it, Detective.
87B215B0     //  You're ruining my drink. It's time to move on.
42C29EB1     //  You say you barely knew Evelyn?
F985653B     //  Yes, that is correct.
2380126F     //  And what was your opinion of her?
CF39F441     //  Pity, bordering on contempt.
ADB496F6     //  I don't like you, McCaffrey. You look like someone who is trying too hard. Like your whole life is some kind of performance. I think you need to give us something to get us out of your life.
2C315494     //  I don't like you either, you pompous stiff-necked patrician. 
797D29A5     //  You think I don't see through you and all the other minions of the ruling class?
1002839F     //  You're lying, McCaffrey. 
F4C5C201     //  You look down your nose at Evelyn but you knew her, and you have some idea of what happened.
4DAAE2C4     //  I hope you're holding aces.
2EB9BEDC     //   I'm telling you again, I barely knew the woman.
08D14C81     //  Run along back to the station, Officer. 
9A653A60     //  Someone really should think about letting you people out less often.
CFB3311B     //  Why would you lend her your book on Metaphysics if you only knew her in passing? It was more than that. A Renaissance man like yourself, lending his books to his acolytes.
1B39AD3F     //  She hounded me about that goddamn book. 
AC69E341     //  And then she lifts it from my apartment and lies to my face that she didn't take it. 
CBC2D200     //  As if she could even comprehend any of it. 
C35AB4F8     //  I saw her go into a hotel with Tiernan last night. 
C70687C9     //  They had booze in a paper bag. 
9DF13C2B     //  He's your man.
7AFD589D     //  Thank you for the information, Mr McCaffrey.
8EFEBC9F     //  McCaffrey, we're not finished with you. 
58500C3D     //  You had your chance to cooperate.
A8B7F1E7     //  What did you make of McCaffrey?
27131379     //  There'll come a day - and it's coming very soon - 
C2094285     //  we'll run him and the rest of his pinko buddies out of Los Angeles.
733E9940     //  I meant as a suspect, Rusty.
947BDC42     //  What can I do for you?
0F0A5120     //  LAPD. Phelps and Galloway. 
350B9C61     //  We're making inquiries into the murder of Evelyn Summers.
28234F14     //  Evelyn... she's dead?
940CD2FD     //  You knew Evelyn Summers, Mr...?
12043F49     //  Robbins. 
F8F1ABB2     //  Yes, I knew Evelyn. I was a good friend of her ex-husband. 
77D1194E     //  She kept some of her stuff here.
EAD74615     //  Can you show us, please?
0C48313E     //  Sure. Come this way.
49540759     //  She kept a bed here, but I probably shouldn't have let her. 
BFFA6986     //  An alcoholic in a liquor store - that was never gonna work out, was it?
F3C2B753     //  We'll take a look around.
AA6F5515     //  Evelyn was in the movie business?
A1A6B2C9     //  A few years ago. 
AC9EC06D     //  She worked in legal copyrights for music.
C1BEA9E2     //  Rawling's Bowling Alley. 
9BAB5D0E     //  Maybe Evelyn did something other than drink in her spare time. 
0E2EEB05     //  Rawling's. I know that place. 
D10D25FD     //  Corner of Ninth and Grand. 
B044E329     //  A lot of cops bowl there on Tuesday nights.
C9D88029     //  I'm guessing Evelyn hadn't held down a job for quite some time before she was killed.
D1530509     //  She wasn't always such a loner.
EA50ED33     //  Better talk to the owner while we're here. He knew the broad.
6BEA52C5     //  We're trying to account for Evelyn's movements yesterday.
B6E2D9AF     //  She came by in the morning.
C69447B2     //  A social visit, to pick up some of her things?
2CB814B7     //  She had a couple of bucks and bought a quart of rye.
065D1D07     //  Any idea where the money came from?
B6BE503A     //  She didn't mention it. 
389AC8DD     //  But she did say the booze was a present for a boy. 
1422F24A     //  She said they had been fighting and she had to make it up to him.
133EF198     //  She was an alcoholic and your friend, and you still kept selling her booze?
63DABD1D     //  You ever try and stop an addict, Detective? 
9CF4F3A6     //  Better me than having her buy methylated spirits from the hardware store.
0537A8F7     //  She was murdered late last night and still extremely drunk. 
1638B333     //  You expect me to believe that she bought a quart here in the morning 
987062C8     //  and it lasted her and her friends a whole day?
17EEE025     //  You have some way of proving that I'm lying about when she came in here?
80670838     //  You should learn to make the distinction 
5B846B8E     //  between the people who are helping you and the people who are not.
C586BBC7     //  We got the impression that Evelyn had been sleeping rough of late.
988BF695     //  It became difficult for me to have her staying here. Her mother was trying to get her back on the straight and narrow. She's old now. And, to be honest, you have to have a good reason to want to get back on.
80522C31     //  When Evelyn bought the booze, did she say who she was meeting or where she was going?
A98FE0B4     //  A young drinking friend of hers, I think. Don't recall his name.
DDBFD4B9     //  Why the ongoing interest in Evelyn, Mr Robbins? You sure you had nothing to do with the breakup of her marriage?
6ECDA317     //  You think you can prove that I was involved with Evelyn?
996019E4     //  That's a pretty low blow, and I've heard some pretty terrible ones over the years.
C8D6D435     //  Do you know a friend of Evelyn's by the name of McCaffrey?
4AF96763     //  Not personally.
D2C1EBF0     //  She talked about McCaffrey?
F17D93EF     //  Supposedly he fought in the International Brigade in Spain, and in the miner's strikes back in Virginia.
8710B1B6     //  We're struggling for leads, Robbins. Did she know McCaffrey?
DABF28F4     //  She idolized him. 
69495131     //  From what I gather the feeling was far from mutual. 
FC48FB20     //  He seems to peddle a revolutionary stance - fixing the ills of society. 
9A5EF6A5     //  You could see how it would appeal to down and outs like Evelyn.
2942A876     //  You sure you don't know McCaffrey? The book was in your room.
446603C3     //  I would have thought it was pretty obvious the book was among Evelyn's things. 
FA2FF131     //  You think you have some way to link me to McCaffrey?
A03F704D     //  I know life's not perfect. 
016FB808     //  I'm sorry about how it turned out for Evelyn, 
92F65323     //  but I don't think we have to destroy everything and start again. 
8D7AC361     //  I'm no revolutionary.
67F2D174     //  Evelyn was reading Aristotle?
8A0765C9     //  Evelyn wasn't stupid. 
38BBD06D     //  The only stupid thing about her was her need to drink.
7C8ABE3F     //  And she was borrowing books from Grosvenor McCaffrey.
67D1B8DD     //  Were you and Evelyn close, Mr Robbins?
E6E7C7CD     //  Not many people will be sad she's gone. 
16FD5E50     //  I'll be one of the few.
1865704C     //  I'm happy to help, Detective, if I can.
75BF1593     //  I hope the information I gave you is helpful. I hope you catch the guy.
9D8C31E5     //  Gentlemen, I have a store to run.
24F62443     //  No offense, but having cops in the store scares away customers.
569392E8     //  That's all? I can be more use to you than that.
A322BE75     //  You sure know how to rub a guy the wrong way.
A0CD1169     //  Thanks for your help, Mr Robbins.
A06322D6     //  No problem. 
28D2D90E     //  Hey - I'd like to make arrangements for the funeral. 
86409AD1     //  You think I could get in touch with Evelyn's mother?
B09516FD     //  Put in a call to the Watch Commander at Central Station, Mr Robbins. He'll be trying to reach the next of kin.
D81E80DB     //  Thanks. 
D0172E45     //  Get the guy, huh? 
7CDE7412     //  Evelyn never hurt anybody.
35D3D1BA     //  I thought you were Evelyn's friend, Robbins?
C5CD9C24     //  You should learn some manners and some goddamn respect.
8E6FF589     //  We're catching murderers. Not running a popularity contest.
3B2C6343     //  Car 11K. Car 11 King, KGPL.
54E7DD82     //  11 King.
A0DFDD21     //  A message from Captain Donelly. Return to Central. Code Two.
E4091372     //  11 King en route.
09FE10FC     //  Let's not keep the man waiting, Phelps.
9034326D     //  The Captain is downstairs with Ray Pinker and Carruthers.
CB87C77C     //  That's a lot of brass down there to be kept waiting, boys.
69E5B721     //  Downstairs, Detectives. Everyone's waiting on you.
D1507D98     //  Lads - you made good time.
F2530C79     //  What's this about, Captain?
72805903     //   Ray and Mal have some concerns over the Henry and 
B4E21F1B     //  Moller cases, which I don't want aired outside of this room.
3F5C3894     //  The evidence is solid, Captain...
402155ED     //  I agree, Rusty. It's just that corpses keep piling up.
C9BDE32E     //  Copycats.
21797F54     //  I've been banging the same drum. 
F3B44984     //  But the notes and the lipstick messages...
83008E34     //  Evelyn Summers. Cartel Classic Carmine. Each woman, same brand, same color.
BB38F0A5     //  Theresa Taraldsen didn't have a lipstick message.
8A63895F     //  Technically you're right, Rusty. 
5636D9AB     //  She didn't have any lipstick, but she did have a message. 
5767B40B     //  We found it beneath her dress, scraped with a sharp stick.
80BBFDF7     //  What did it say?
AADC6FDC     //  You sure you want to know?
69BD95F2     //  Ray?
FF94F3E2     //  As far as we can be sure it said 'Cunt BD'.
1E9CD690     //  That's one way of looking at it.
439DCBD1     //  Looking at what?
5D654A8F     //  Cunt is all about access, Phelps. You're married. Yours is mortgaged. Some of us like to pay by installments. This guy doesn't like to pay at all.
2FEC0BC7     //  Why are you so angry, Mal?
383D7E32     //  Because I just had to fire one of my assistants. 
741F6BBA     //  He's a friend of Jamison's. 
F364D358     //  God knows what he might have been up to.
CE4E3E45     //  Captain, we have good leads in the Summers case. But it's up to you to decide how we proceed.
D041766E     //  Keep this under your hat for now and follow up on Evelyn Summers. I want daily reports.
101340FF     //  We got our orders. Back to the Summers case. Get an address for McCaffrey - he'll have blown the bar. I'll meet you outside.
C4649D34     //  I need an address for a Grosvenor McCaffrey.
ABF4E654     //  Grosvenor McCaffrey... apartment six, 126 Yale Street, between Ord and Alpine.
9D07102D     //  Hello, Rusty. Two on your usual lane?
0AB34057     //  I'm Detective Phelps. Homicide.
ED8365C6     //  You must be new. What's your shoe size?
47821871     //  This is business, Florence. You got a guy works here by the name of Tiernan?
6B6F5F14     //  Sure we do. He's a pin setter. Clears the jams, works the gutters. Go right in - he'll be hopping around the lanes toward the back. He's a nice boy.
D165FA7E     //  Thanks, ma'am.
DE113E8A     //  We're conducting an investigation, ma'am. Do you know the name Evelyn Summers?
33DD5AB4     //  Sounds like I should. Maybe it could be Jimmy's friend.
657B1E09     //  Jimmy?
926B029F     //  James Tiernan. He's a pin setter. One day he introduced me to a lady after work. It stuck in my mind because she was much older. Too old for him.
DB78C593     //  Where can we find Jimmy, Florence?
E266201F     //  He'll be hopping around the lanes toward the back.
D165FA7E     //  Thanks, ma'am.
F973C3D5     //  You'll find Jimmy monkeying around with the pin machines.
B2DDAD53     //  Why not play a couple of games, Rusty? Your partner looks like he could use a little cheering up.
58662D48     //  Hello? Were you saying something?
A2980053     //  Tiernan? LAPD!
90AC2682     //  Looks like we'll have to wait till he comes round. Call an ambulance, will you, Rusty?
9A98D9FF     //  McCaffrey's in apartment six.
EDEAB284     //  Doesn't look like anybody's home.
42082B7B     //  Terrible shame. Means there's nobody to let us in. You want to do the honors, Phelps?
040B60DE     //  Take a look around.
7CA89E87     //  He said he was at home, he said he didn't know her, and we have the book.
5F9E1FFC     //  Let's see Carruthers argue his way out of this one.
6C113BD5     //  Torn from the letter we found beside the body. At the very least, I'd say it ties McCaffrey to the scene.
49E3ABC0     //  Is that you, Grosvenor?
CB415C71     //  Who are you guys? What are you doing in here?
29DE5367     //  We're from the LAPD, ma'am. Do you know where we might find McCaffrey?
C7454ECF     //  I'm his neighbor. Is he in trouble?
07D6DE72     //  Look, lady - we need to find him and in a hurry. Are you going to give me trouble?
315F4F21     //  He has a pigeon coop up on the roof. He spends his mornings up there when he's been drinking.
81C5BB7B     //  How do we get up there?
32B08F87     //  Down the hall and up the stairs.
99F9598E     //  I've told you where he might be. That's the best I can do.
B4D1F9BC     //  Talk to Grosvenor. I've got housework to do.
4D5999A2     //  Where are you going? Do you still want to speak to Grosvenor?
B400A670     //  Grosvenor McCaffrey!
7A57446E     //  Throwing punches get you high, Grosvenor? That it?
3739C2C5     //  Blood's running now, isn't it? You getting angry, Mr McCaffrey.
15EE3674     //  For a man of the people, you're awfully self-serving.
1D10551C     //  I know we got McCaffrey in the can, Cole, but the tire iron was stamped 'Rawling's Bowling Alley'. We ought to work that angle.
4FDAF0B6     //  McCaffrey, you're under arrest on suspicion of murdering Evelyn Summers.
F37164B6     //  We need to get Downtown and wrap this thing up. 
10302EDA     //  It's gotta be McCaffrey... 
721C4B8F     //  unless Tiernan set him up. 
44CD0EAA     //  You don't think that asshole Jamison could have done it, do you? 
E60CD18F     //  Whoever did it, at least it wasn't that Dahlia fuck.
53974AF4     //  How do you know that McCaffrey didn't do the Dahlia?
37B20C82     //  We have a list of over 200 suspects. 
BAC96EBE     //  His name was never on it.
D5BFFF44     //  Great. Now we have a corpse instead of a suspect. This case is fucked.
2BC506B7     //  You sure you can make it stick with one of these suspects, gentlemen?
5A149D3A     //  It's either McCaffrey or Tiernan, sir.
80103BA9     //  I think Jamison is an aberration.
C9C7132D     //  Alright. I'll deal with that degraded lunatic myself.
3FACD8E4     //  Why did you run, Tiernan?
96887B2F     //  I was the last one to see Evelyn that night. I knew you would think it was me.
FFB77529     //  Can you describe your relationship with Evelyn?
4C878394     //  I barely knew Evelyn.
7DBCC7C5     //  She was old enough to be your mother, Tiernan. Were you banging her?
9AA8CBF4     //  Like I said - we were close.
40DD4E54     //  You a mommy's boy, Tiernan?
06693736     //  Sounds like half an answer to me, Tiernan. Were you sleeping with her?
39CF6851     //  That's none of your business.
120621B6     //  Keep lying to me and I'll have you charged 
FF3D06D3     //  and in front of a Grand Jury before your feet touch the ground.
4A83563E     //  How can you possibly prove Evelyn and I were more than friends?
250961A2     //  How come this is so hard to believe? A man and a woman getting along, liking each other, just as friends?
D0235797     //  McCaffrey gave you up, Tiernan. 
13CF03EE     //  He says he saw you go into your hotel with Evelyn.
8B4CB899     //  I met Evelyn at the Public Library. 
F5361785     //  We would read for a while and then go for a drink. 
13094D11     //  Last night we went back to my hotel room and had some more to drink. 
4EFB9D4B     //  I must have passed out. 
9ADFBB09     //  I woke up and she was gone.
3A5B3AF9     //  What time was this?
7C90BA6D     //  Around midnight. Maybe later.
47E74872     //  And there's no one who can confirm this?
69558716     //  No. There isn't. I knew you wouldn't believe me.
76EA1F77     //  You and Evelyn were drinking together last night, and she had no other place to stay.
0BDE98AE     //  I don't know what happened last night. I don't remember.
89CDADE8     //  Come on, Tiernan. Either you killed her or she left the hotel. Why did she leave?
D543D894     //  Look, I may have yelled at her. I was very drunk. It's hard to remember.
108EE881     //  If you don't give me some reason to think differently about this, Tiernan, I'm gonna have to go to the DA.
F65448CB     //  I drank half a bottle of scotch. 
2896AD28     //  I don't remember a goddamn thing.
60267E59     //  You're lying, Tiernan. You'd been fighting with her. You fought, and...
43568D3B     //  I'm not lying. She got up and left. That was it.
BC47A0D2     //  Don't talk about how it was between me and Evelyn. 
EB2FAD55     //  You don't know anything.
E85EDE21     //  She bought a quart of whiskey to make it up to you. 
17F4B0EB     //  She told the liquor store owner. 
0A0CD850     //  You're in deep trouble, buddy.
AE093E89     //  She said she loved me, that she wanted to care for me. 
5C02EC62     //  But she would never stop talking about McCaffrey. 
2A442E47     //  McCaffrey was a writer, McCaffrey was a hero, McCaffrey cared for the little guy...
47960E02     //  Did you kill her, Tiernan?
685716AE     //  I might as well have. 
DD637BF9     //  I kicked her out. 
B1542DFC     //  She had nowhere to go.
9A58905C     //  She wanted something of his.
15408CC2     //  You don't like McCaffrey, do you, Tiernan?
CEEDA915     //  He's full of the Common Man routine, but he props up a bar like the rest of us. Evelyn thought he was gonna be a great novelist - he had nothing but vitriol for her.
2881FB8E     //  We either hang this on you or McCaffrey. You better give us something.
A7D8346E     //  McCaffrey's been in trouble with the law before. 
B6286833     //  He always makes out it was some kind of labor dispute, but I'm not so sure.
635E30AC     //  You hate McCaffrey. You're trying to frame him for this.
90C50E1F     //  You've got the wrong guy. How can you prove that?
8118E1EA     //  I'm telling you, McCaffrey did this. Do something about it and leave me alone.
83D4E967     //  You've spoken to McCaffrey? I can go? It's all been cleared up?
A7FD6B78     //  Not quite. 
E6CBA9C8     //  We have one more question we need to ask, James. 
902DE994     //  Then I think we will be done.
DFADF610     //  Sure, go ahead.
F61193B6     //  So Evelyn passed out and you walked out. What happened next?
210AD1BE     //  I woke up in the morning. 
1E80A7D4     //  Very hung over.
39E28CE4     //   I thought Evelyn would have come back...
06AF17AC     //  After she left you never saw her again?
3B47009B     //  No. Unfortunately... no.
5B91DCB5     //  McCaffrey's pointing the finger directly back at you, James. You better think of something and think of it fast.
53ED9218     //  I've told you all I know. I wouldn't do a thing like this.
E8BBFF3D     //  I know you're lying, James. You went out looking for her. Tell me what really happened.
8128934D     //  I don't know what you're talking about. How can you say I wasn't in that hotel room?
D2E97131     //  You wound up at McCaffrey's. You were still incredibly drunk. You passed out on his floor. It's time to tell me what really happened.
7DB5B801     //  McCaffrey woke me up the next morning. 
D50DC809     //  He showed me the lug wrench, and the letter and the box. 
A1D44BD4     //  And... 
22A3F1BA     //  he said that I came in with them last night. 
A7AE9DDA     //  He said that I killed Evelyn... 
2FF8330B     //  and that it was all over the radio, and that he would protect me. 
AA058D52     //  And I don't know, Detective, for the life of me I can't remember a goddamn thing. I was angry with her, really angry, I could have done it. 
944887E9     //  Was it me?
6302BADD     //  James Tiernan, I'm charging you with the murder of Evelyn Summers. I believe you didn't know what you were doing. I'll speak to the DA on your behalf. That's the best I can do for you now.
DCFC3652     //  Do you drive, Tiernan?
8BE7E949     //  No, I don't.
1AD434BA     //  Have access to a lug wrench?
E907F434     //  We use a lot of them. To clear jams in the pin setting machines.
AA129E26     //  Evelyn was beaten to death with a lug wrench. We found a wrench at McCaffrey's apartment.
0742FAD7     //  You see? It was McCaffrey. He had nothing but hatred for me and Evelyn.
ECA15847     //  Coroner's report says that Evelyn was killed with a wrench. I think you did it and then planted the evidence at McCaffrey's apartment for us to find.
056B821F     //  We went to his apartment. McCaffrey was up on the roof. Evelyn stole the book. McCaffrey went crazy when he found out. He said... he said he would put her out of her misery. He can be very cruel.
E817D851     //  I want the truth. I think you broke into McCaffrey's apartment and planted a lug wrench there.
9C97C6AD     //  I didn't do that and there's no way you can prove any different.
639A85B5     //  As hard as this is for you to contemplate, I really loved Evelyn. She was kind and gentle to me.
357B5415     //  Evelyn was missing a ring from her right hand.
6907869E     //  That's strange. She always wore it. 
67F08B68     //  A big black circular disc with a white E in the middle. 
5BA85EA1     //  It was made from an old typewriter key. 
E5CF5EC5     //  A present from the prop department at her old movie studio.
E1745012     //  We're going to talk to McCaffrey. You need to think about what you've told us, Tiernan. You're not in the clear.
CC5D1F10     //  No, don't go. We both want the truth here.
851F9D76     //  Aristotle's Metaphysics. The book that belonged to McCaffrey.
7F7EA851     //  McCaffrey saw her looking at it once and laughed in her face.
2B014EAA     //  And you're saying Evelyn stole it?
B4FF26BC     //  I've had my say. 
08648516     //  I'll not say anything more.
CD49259B     //  Don't talk to me about Evelyn anymore. 
18347093     //  It's too... 
696F57AE     //  I can't take it.
83DEA238     //  This standing around, saying nothing. Is this some kind of mental torture?
48603023     //  You should let me go now. I've done nothing wrong.
E7694C34     //  Smack me if you want, but I'm not answering any more questions.
556A7D75     //  I need the jacket on a Grosvenor McCaffrey.
F58B58E7     //  Just a moment, Detective... 
DB27A8EC     //  McCaffrey was formerly under surveillance by the Red Squad. 
6D3FEE8C     //  Convictions for petty theft. 
4C89FE1A     //  Dishonorable discharge from the Army during the Italian campaign - assault on a Sicilian woman. 
96133CE1     //  Says he almost beat the woman to death.
2706F944     //  You ready to answer some questions?
FB783D72     //  You think I have all the answers?
F129C633     //  People who run from the police usually have something to hide.
E712E98B     //  Touché, Detective. Let's see where this takes us.
F8F39A51     //  You told us you barely knew Evelyn Summers.
003DEDD1     //  She hung around sometimes. I had very little to do with her.
CFBC2BFB     //  So she was your follower?
2449F001     //  That's one way of describing her. She was like a stray dog desperate for a master.
F41F0A37     //  Doesn't look good, Grosvenor. It's either you or Tiernan from where we're sitting.
DD148D12     //  Personally, I think Evelyn is better off. 
1700880F     //  But I had nothing to do with it.
D72B5AEF     //  You'll have to do better than that, Grosvenor. We know about you and Evelyn.
414BBABB     //  Evelyn was a lush and a boring one at that. You can't link her to me.
1AA4F05E     //  Seems there's a serious gulf between what you think you know and what you actually do, Detective.
6ECA168B     //  We know that you thought enough of her to loan out your copy of The Metaphysics.
6A4E034C     //  I what? 
BA2AAF26     //  I did no such thing. 
9B116453     //  That bitch stole that book from my apartment. 
605FE1FF     //  The impudent fucking moron...
59270CB9     //  And that made you angry?
602689F2     //  Angry? I was livid. Looking up at me with that stupid face of hers, begging me to forgive her... ah ha. Very good. That's one to you, Detective.
B64A4315     //  We found the lug wrench that Evelyn was battered with in your apartment. And the note from her mother, and your bloodstained clothing. We have you cold, McCaffrey.
DE5A8295     //  You think if I could be bothered to murder Evelyn Summers, 
C9E86E14     //  I would be stupid enough to leave the evidence in my apartment?
9B12EF10     //  So you're telling me you were set up?
988DBCC6     //  That's my conclusion.
ECA29940     //  If it was planted there, then some evil mastermind must be at work here. You got a name, McCaffrey?
8801F6A3     //  Tiernan. Who else?
4B2A7964     //  I was under the impression you thought Tiernan incapable of tying his own shoe laces.
F0BB0F5F     //  I don't believe you, Grosvenor. The evidence says that you killed her.
E750EF61     //  You can prove that I wanted to kill Evelyn?
56F18419     //  Will there be much more of this? It's just that I wanted to get home and work on some pages.
755D4D9A     //  Tiernan is prepared to testify that you threatened Evelyn's life in his presence.
6B7D56EC     //  Self preservation. That's understandable. 
2785ECB5     //  Okay, I'll level with you. 
440C4C57     //  Tiernan killed Evelyn. He came to me for help. 
752B12FA     //  I listened to him and he explained why he did it.
B9DCC775     //  Tiernan went to you for help? You expect me to buy that?
E66087B4     //  That's how it went down. I told him he made a terrible mistake, but he would be throwing his life away if he went to the cops. I took his things and told him I would dispose of them.
1C5A338C     //  But you didn't.
C9FEF157     //  Speak to Tiernan. He'll give it up.
7D6C839B     //  Evelyn died sometime around midnight. Remind me - where were you?
9A41340A     //  I was at home, writing. I'm working on a manuscript.
740BA6E2     //  And you have someone who can corroborate your story?
5EB006BE     //  Unfortunately, no.
D33F8540     //  You're going to need to do better if you don't want to swing for this.
C34748D8     //  I was having a political meeting in my apartment.
FAEE180C     //  Cheese and crackers for the fifth columnists.
538C77A8     //  Some of these people will corroborate your story?
BED638B2     //  I won't give up names of party members.
42B5F34E     //  Good. It's your funeral.
6A2D8340     //  You're lying, McCaffrey. You were out at the railyard.
A2914B7B     //  And what do you have that proves I was there?
3E58BB33     //  How about half of Augusta Summers' last correspondence with her daughter?
C8E25565     //  What are you talking about?
5F96FEDF     //  After you were done beating Evelyn, you searched her and found her mother's letter. 
33CCA5ED     //  That old lady's anguish amused you.
F9EF3897     //  I know nothing about a letter or Evelyn's goddamn mother.
B1359ACD     //  So what was it doing on your writing desk?
4AB51756     //  I don't know, but if I didn't put it there, somebody else did. Try exercising your powers of deduction on that.
63003B82     //  You're going to have to do better than that, Detective.
52211047     //  You were in the war?
4A243758     //  Yes I was. 
E3183590     //  Seeing the things that I saw... it changes a man. 
966EDB63     //  I came back here determined to change things. 
2183C684     //  All I wanted was a pen and an opportunity to speak out.
93DEB42D     //  You told us before that you had only minor run-ins with the police. You didn't mention petty theft.
B6AC7CF5     //  I've never been in trouble for violence. That's the salient point here, isn't it?
C12BC45A     //  So that's the extent of your criminal record?
490CD538     //  That's right. I'm fighting for social change. 
06A611D8     //  I'm no criminal.
F874DEB4     //  You're holding out on us, McCaffrey. What other trouble have you been in?
6DC8DD81     //  I was in a few labor disputes before the war. I didn't use my real name.
7120FD38     //  You're lying, McCaffrey. You have a history of violence towards women.
8D17898C     //  How do you turn a couple of parking tickets and a petty theft misdemeanor into an assault charge?
7E063B43     //  No man should be without history, Detective. 
A0EDEF49     //  Mine is colorful, but nothing more.
1F540FD2     //  We know all about you and your dishonorable discharge - beating some poor woman near to death in Syracuse. You've never been in combat, McCaffrey. Your whole life is a fraud.
BC5689A6     //  She was a goddamn peasant whore. She tried to steal from my wallet. I could have fought for this country. I could have...
4CE30E30     //  You beat her because she stole from you. Because she tried to outsmart you...
DC900426     //  The ignorant audacity of the bitch. What is a man supposed to do? Sit there and take it? How is a man supposed to call himself a man...

EA1F1047     //  Detectives? Over here.
A87BD826     //  Cole Phelps, Traffic. What have we got?
990A6F45     //  Vic is a white male. Name of Lester Pattison. 
D778AD57     //  Walked out of the bar and into the street, car hit over there, and he ended up here. 
27575EE0     //  Dead on impact by the look of it.
9888C184     //  Have you canvassed the area?
11786E44     //  The only one with anything useful to contribute is the young lady over there. 
9B82E8AD     //  She lives above the bar. Name of Shannon Perry. No, it's not a stage name. 
0C1F9CA2     //  Twenty-four years old. She left Kansas to follow the Yellow Brick Road.
00653195     //  Is that so?
79EAA4A1     //  We'll take a formal statement later. Right now we're going to take a look around.
B6C359AB     //  Look, I can't tell you how to do your job.
FCB778B3     //  I've secured the crime scene, Detective. That's the procedure.
30F6F868     //  Landed on his face and ended up here. Car must have struck him from behind.
F33C0EB4     //  We can notify next of kin.
C40F98E3     //  Puncture wound? But he was hit from behind...
005499E7     //  Check the other pocket, Phelps.
97D667D3     //  Pattison has life insurance.
4810029F     //  Careful where you're stepping, Phelps. I don't come down to the station house and tap dance on your desk.
F55A55B9     //  Body traveled a good twenty feet.
2CD2A267     //  So the driver managed to brake before the impact.
93ED49B7     //  Vehicle fled in a hurry once it was over.
2F833F0E     //  You should take a look at the body. Poor guy didn't stand a chance.
A5789C34     //  I made a preliminary examination - You probably want to take a look, then we'll talk.
06983FD1     //  What have you got on the victim?
4CAA25EE     //  From all reports he was intoxicated at the time of the accident. 
03D581B1     //  I'll know how intoxicated once I've done the autopsy. 
9CDEBC98     //  Looking him over now, I'd say he died on impact.
3729E659     //  What about the chest wound? Isn't that inconsistent?
FEBAB627     //  Very common in auto injuries. 
3429168B     //  Look for a car with a prominent hood ornament. 
B4114E51     //  Those things are killers.
18B9D396     //  Sorry, Phelps, do you mind if I get on with this?
166A63CD     //  Maybe talk to some witnesses. We can discuss the autopsy report later.
6AC98532     //  You should be making progress, Detective.
DA2A1E95     //  An accident like this could happen to anyone. I hope you catch the bum.
5F8311B5     //  Hate to say it, but these accidents are a dime a dozen. Hope you catch the bum.
CA99CBE1     //  You need to get out there and catch this guy.
FBA612ED     //  Gang way, Detective.
F4F858B6     //  I'll have some prints ready for your report if you let me get on with this.
7D9AC45C     //  She's all yours, Detective.
2A123D63     //  Did you see what happened, Miss...?
94961094     //  Perry, Shannon Perry. 
96C41E35     //  Yes. I live just upstairs. 
61925ED0     //  I saw everything.
6EE55ACF     //  Miss Perry?
3B616C0D     //  Yes.
A799297A     //  I'm Detective Phelps. This is my partner, Detective Bekowsky.
C9484576     //  Can you tell us what happened?
2BE3C62B     //  Well... I came to the window, because I heard people arguing downstairs.
5169F146     //  Then what happened?
B898065C     //  I saw a car hit that poor man and knock him down the street.
2C337A8F     //  You were already at the window. You're nosy, aren't you, Miss Perry?
FD2E93C0     //  Do you want my help or don't you?
7CD5D65F     //  You weren't at the window, you were in the bar. What's a young girl like you doing alone in a bar?
D92F9797     //  That's a goddamn lie.
5BE406E0     //  Go away.
9042FBC8     //  I can tell you - the police in Shawnee County are a lot nicer than they are here.
6379810E     //  What kind of car was it?
A8229427     //  A dark red Lincoln Continental.
2A883B47     //  Did you see the license plate?
4271BA3A     //  Only the first three letters, I'm afraid.
7E6D4F85     //   3C8.
BB1D0CF0     //  It's pretty dark, Miss Perry. You sure about the car?
17D90301     //  Of course I'm sure.
E0E068FC     //  My uncle Bernie has one just like it back in Topeka.
B273FF71     //  Why are you lying to me, Miss Perry?
0AC9786A     //  You've got rocks in your head. Why would I lie about the car?
3B1FD614     //  I need to go home now. I don't want to talk to you anymore.
5BC5E88A     //  Tell me more about the argument you heard.
438A1E5C     //  Well, there were two voices. 
9E99008F     //  A man and a woman. That's all. 
DBA8B27F     //  Go on.
DBA8B27F     //  Go on.
7B4CE39D     //  Then a third person - another man - got involved.
BA96DA55     //  Why are you holding out on us, Miss Perry?
67E4E505     //  I'm sorry... 
37727B2F     //  I was hoping to tell my story to the newspapers. 
72081DC8     //  I'd like to get my picture in the paper. 
FDCD4854     //  I'm trying to find work as an actress and things are pretty difficult.
57A77F44     //  Cough it up, sister. We don't have all night.
6DEE0EFF     //  The people arguing, they were husband and wife. 
B8F69B85     //  I could tell by what she was yelling. 
052EB61D     //  Intimate things. Very embarrassing for the man.
93E78501     //  That's a nice story, Miss Perry. But it's not what really happened.
39CCE141     //  You think I'm making this up?
43686CC3     //  I'm not a silly little kid. I don't tell tales just to get attention.
07847C13     //  I'm afraid that's all I know.
77FDA2D8     //  The poor man. I'm not feeling that well. I think I should go back upstairs and sit down.
4BD92FE6     //  Detective?
69156205     //  This might not be important, but...
A2CF2877     //  Aren't you at least going to try to catch the man that did this?
CD745B7B     //  I thought the policemen in Hollywood would be friendly. I won't say another word to you.
A70C5EE3     //  I've done nothing wrong and I won't be treated like a crook. Go away.
81EA97BE     //  Thank you, Miss Perry. Your information has been very helpful. You can go now.
42D1B1E4     //  You really think so?
240CBAD6     //  I hope you find that driver and put him away.
F76C743F     //  It's in your best interest to work with the LAPD, ma'am. One day you'll find yourself in trouble and needing a cop.
D19590D0     //  You've certainly got a way with the dames, Phelps.
B3E8356E     //  Give it a rest, Bekowsky.
9E78D1AA     //  Let's see what the patrons have to say.
B77BB81D     //  You could use the phone in the back of the bar. Call in what we have on the suspect vehicle.
05B85E55     //  I need to run a partial license plate, three-Charles-eight.
2355D6F5     //  Cross check possible Lincoln owners.
9B30D4D0     //  Suspect vehicle is a red Lincoln Continental.
AFE3BDB5     //  Just a moment, Detective...
3B29344A     //  Only one possible make on that license.
318213BF     //  Registered to a William Shelton,
7BA8AB2D     //  738 West Temple Street.
599CB830     //  I need a list of dark red Lincoln Continentals.
C6CBAA65     //  Just a moment...
49AFCDC7     //  This is going to be quite a list, Detective.
CB3B6227     //  Cross check for registered addresses. 
DF9CA9D4     //  Top of the pile anything from the Downtown area, around Bunker Hill.
45BF0E62     //  One moment...
E30D99A5     //  Fred Murray, 120 South Olive Street, between First and Second Street.
0E6CED26     //  Harris Jones, number one Dylan Lane.
65F5F3A9     //  William Shelton of 738 West Temple Street.
C9F0ECE9     //  That's all for Downtown.
9300F54F     //  You got that, Detective?
ECA9497D     //  Looks like we caught a break on this one.
BDC02484     //  Might call for some legwork, but it's better than nothing.
70B46AD0     //  I'll take the bartender. You work the rest of the room.
161192D3     //  Yes sir, Detective. The Japanese had no chance, did they?
4958F938     //  I'm Detective Phelps of the LAPD.
C18CBA7B     //  How can I help, Detective?
83754F37     //  Your name would be a good start.
2AD9A251     //  Dudley Lynch. Hired help. I run the place when the owner ain't around.
F3683923     //  Where is the owner?
9C33CEDB     //  He stepped out. Somebody had to take Lorna... Mrs Pattison home.
83789B78     //  What can you tell me about the accident?
7AC8F128     //  Not a lot.
43ED1C06     //  It was busy in here and all I heard was the impact.
B237FBFB     //  Do you know the victim?
194F12A9     //  Yeah. Lester Pattison. He's a regular here, or he was.
BC69D0B9     //  So you didn't see what happened?
89FBF437     //  By the time I got out there, it was all over.
5BA8A754     //  Why do I get the feeling you're holding out on me?
2E26476B     //  Lester and Lorna were having a fight. The owner made them take it outside. It was pretty ugly.
CC77629B     //  Why are you lying, Lynch? What are you covering up?
9BB3A71D     //  Is that the best you've got? 
61C15CD1     //  You expecting me to confess to being the driver?
9414506C     //  I'd suggest you speak to someone who saw what happened. I'm about done speaking to you.
978E2547     //  A witness overheard an argument?
8DDFF206     //  Lester and Lorna.
61F2C839     //  There's nothing like airing your dirty laundry in public, is there?
B9C8FFCD     //  What was it about?
29FF48BA     //  Who knows.
44DCAF27     //  The slightest thing could set those two off.
606F0480     //  Leroy?
E6873790     //  Leroy Sabo. The owner.
35F95020     //  Thanks for your help, Lynch. I'm going to need you to sign a statement with the patrolman.
0C32B5AE     //  Sorry, pal. That's all I got. Even bartenders run out of gossip.
401911BF     //  You need to take this up with Leroy.
F670F94E     //  I'm here all day. You want information, I'm your guy.
16768FAB     //  No offense fellas, but having cops hanging around ain't exactly good for business.
245C32CE     //  I'm done talking to you, copper. Bar's closed.
1A64AF39     //  I got no more for you, and even if I did, I wouldn't share.
509C1F57     //  You get anything out of the regulars?
6FDDAA08     //  They weren't giving too much away.
8D5A2B40     //  They liked watching Lester and Lorna go a few rounds every other day.
E108B35E     //  And Lester was a fan of the love tap.
ECBC9F8C     //  So this is why everybody comes to Ray's.
E64E00D4     //  A knife covered in blood.
E91587B1     //  Could be a steak knife? This is a hit and run case, Phelps. Anyone could have thrown away a kitchen knife.
54FF3437     //  I'm sure Carruthers will confirm this as the murder weapon. Let's talk to Leroy - see him explain his way out of this.
04B377CD     //  An empty space on the knife rack, a bloodstained knife 
124E51E0     //  and a puncture wound in Lester Pattison's chest. 
B4F8402E     //  We finally have the full picture.
59D4D230     //  In any case, we'll want Tech Services to scrub the alleyway before they bag the knife.
EC8C66DF     //  So Lorna finally has enough of Lester, stabs him twice in the chest, and pushes him in front of a car?
B0015344     //  Lorna Pattison stab Lester? She strike you as the type who gets her nails dirty?
969A1BAA     //  Sabo.
36B7DC5D     //  The two of them, acting in concert. We go after Sabo and try for Murder One.
DDF7C5F6     //  Let's try the bar.
DEC750D9     //  We've got a couple of leads to run down. You have it under control here?
A24BC4FF     //  Sure. As soon as the coroner gives the word I'll finish up here.
6A690221     //  We'll check in with you.
96B45A19     //  Okay. I'll get him on to a slab. Should have the report soon.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
2F9F8BD4     //  That's not our vehicle.
421B81D9     //  This thing's been gathering dust for months.
AFA32D65     //  Let's try the next one.
2EE33054     //  Navy blue.
4BD7E5E5     //  The DMV gremlin strikes again.
262C53DD     //  Let's get out of here, Phelps.
9BED1DAB     //  That's the son of a bitch right there.
53C771C8     //  William Shelton?
3B616C0D     //  Yes.
FB945EE7     //  It doesn't look good, Shelton, you packing your bags and making a run for it.
28B78F07     //  You know why we're here?
3B616C0D     //  Yes.
E3A765D8     //  The accident.
4A862422     //  We've got witnesses who can put this car at the scene, not to mention the physical damage. This is open and shut, Shelton.
587BC7F0     //  Don't let that asshole get away.
DCB9767B     //  That coward thinks he can run from everything.
9A4E1FAD     //  No wonder he killed someone driving like this.
B27962BA     //  Hold it right there, Shelton.
0F740EB0     //  He's heading into the station. Go on, get after him!
56A2516E     //  Goddammit. So much for our hit and run case.
79DF7AE7     //  Alright, I give up!
04594526     //  How does a vehicular manslaughter rap sound, Shelton?
C7324B8A     //  I hit him. I admit it. I just panicked. But it wasn't my fault!
71BAF1A5     //  What do you mean?
517D3853     //  The guy jumped right out in front of me. He came out of nowhere. There was nothing I could do about it.
60C706BB     //  Why didn't you stop?
6F4F5C0A     //  I've had accidents before.
80CCE0AF     //  That's it, we're done here. The DA is going to love you.
04098DB4     //  They weren't all my fault.
24220037     //  I'm a surveyor.
86EAB139     //  I need my license for my job.
1CA17F26     //  There were people around... a woman and a man were standing right next to him.
1BC92F56     //  I thought they could get him to a hospital.
66010E57     //  I'm telling you, it's not my fault!
C09D3937     //  The guy is dead, Shelton.
C91082B6     //  You can't be serious.
C2CC7516     //  William Shelton, you're coming Downtown. We need to talk about a manslaughter charge.
D2A2F083     //  You haven't heard my side of the story.
F76A6E51     //  Look, it's very unfortunate that a man has died, but it wasn't my fault.
A6833DAE     //  I want an attorney. I'm not saying anything more till I speak to my attorney.
4258F4CD     //  Leave the coroner and the paperwork. Procedure can wait. We should probably go speak to the wife - let her know what's happening.
63E4A0F1     //  Okay. You become all heart at the prospect of paperwork, don't you?
7A160AAF     //  So, initial report came back with an ID on our victim. Lester Dee Pattison of 182 North Hope Street. The Captain wants us there double quick.
25F94D9F     //  You think Mal is done with the autopsy? Better call it in and check, Phelps. Between the driver and the widow I say we start dealing with the facts.
D17A8DCC     //  It's a lucky break getting a partial ID. These cases are usually dead in the water after twenty-four hours if no one comes forward.
2252436D     //  Why don't they just stop?
627D1554     //  You heard about fight or flight during the war?
525A300D     //  Sure. 'Never back your enemy into a corner'. That kind of stuff.
0936B7F9     //  Right. Well, in a hit and run the perp is already in flight. It's easier to keep going. Takes a degree of moral courage to stop and accept responsibility.
4833FC36     //  You're not as dumb as you make yourself out to be, are you, Stefan?
E49A7C30     //  I didn't know I was making myself out to be dumb.
C0B75F74     //  People are like onions, Phelps. You need to peel away a few layers to see what's really underneath.
0805EC9A     //  So the wife was there when it happened, but then left the scene?
4989EB9A     //  You're right. That's pretty unusual behavior.
1CDB65E2     //  She could be in shock. I saw some people do some strange things in the war after their buddies got hurt.
1B08CCF5     //  Maybe. Maybe she doesn't give a fuck. According to the patrons, her old man was a piece of work.
BBAB689F     //  You don't think...?
F76B46E4     //  Phelps, the guy was run over. So it worked out well for this broad. So what? Maybe she deserved to catch a break. Who knows?
E89632C2     //  You like Polack jokes, Phelps?
41DD60B6     //  Is this a test, Bekowsky?
2C62AB05     //  Lighten up, Phelps. I find some of them funny.
2BA8AB93     //  Okay?
850404CC     //  You were in the War?
3A957AF6     //  Look, we both know that.
ADCAB323     //  Okay, so here's a war joke. How did the Germans conquer Poland so fast?
7ED16B6D     //  I don't know, Stefan. How did they?
E1BF4C64     //  They marched in backwards and the Poles thought they were leaving.
CDDCFB2F     //  Yes? Hello?
F1EE4FD9     //  Mrs Pattison?
2B73668C     //  Is this about my husband?
743615D1     //  We're investigating the incident, ma'am.
76BA32A5     //  I see.
F96E5735     //  Come in, won't you?
E070CBF0     //  Can you tell me what happened?
2B9C2BA9     //  What's to tell?
5049C46C     //  He got hit by a car and now he's dead.
0912FAD9     //  You don't appear to be too upset about the fact.
00C88C82     //  Lester and I met on a furlough in '44.
EAFB4576     //  We got married that weekend.
264DB0D7     //  People don't understand it now but that happened a lot back then.
76BA32A5     //  I see.
D8604507     //  So you probably did well to stick it out this long.
138043C3     //  What's that supposed to mean, mister?
1927BA79     //  I think it's about time you left.
64A39F57     //  I have someone here, and I...
DCDD2839     //  I beg your pardon? You're going to have to run that one by us again, sister.
04CAA9DB     //  We wanted to give you the facts about the accident, ma'am.
4EFA5DD2     //  I appreciate that. But I think I know most of them already, Detective.
861C2275     //  He got hit by a car. Now he's dead.
D0A48D86     //  What more is there to tell?
C8BFF8A5     //  Pardon me, but you don't appear to be too upset about it.
EE689F51     //  Lester and I met on a furlough in '44. We got married that weekend. People don't understand it now but that happened a lot back then.
76BA32A5     //  I see.
AA152E31     //  So you probably did well to stick together this long.
138043C3     //  What's that supposed to mean, mister?
1927BA79     //  I think it's about time you left.
64A39F57     //  I have someone here, and I...
19D804A6     //  Beg your pardon? You're going to have to run that one by us again, sister.
98B56735     //  It's okay, Lorna.
31CF9038     //  I'm Leroy Sabo.
51302910     //  Well, well.
1872BE2B     //  Nice to see you're comforting the grieving widow, Mr Sabo.
E566FD5D     //  Alright, wise guy.
AE07B3F6     //  Do you have any intelligent questions you would like me to answer?
7C502181     //  You can confirm Mrs Pattison's story?
B907BAD3     //  Lester lost at cards.
D51608CF     //  He was kind of hard to control when he'd lost his temper.
5B0D11D5     //  He turned without looking and walked right out in front of the car.
8A997009     //  It wasn't good.
CE060BA0     //  What's your relationship with Mrs Pattison, Mr Sabo?
9573D406     //  We're friends. Good friends.
A64A33EC     //  You expect me to believe that?
5FD32C14     //  Look, I was filing for divorce. Mental cruelty. Lester could be a mean son of a bitch.
FCA12C3E     //  And Lester knew about that?
76B8BD29     //  No. I hadn't told him.
463E0CE8     //  Well, hasn't this worked out well for the two of you?
F6C73B14     //  I feel almost bad for busting in on this little rendezvous.
3D3184B4     //  I'm outta here, Lorna. I've got a business to run.
12F5662E     //  Hey! Come back here! You've got no right...
902CACF0     //  My wife has one of these boards.
0FCA752F     //  Looks like Lorna is missing a knife.
C241FEE6     //  Perfect match. This must have been one hell of a marital home.
DBC7F749     //  How did the car come to hit Lester?
6042A719     //  You were arguing in the bar and on the sidewalk.
2ACB18D0     //  We were always arguing. So what?
F1E59D6E     //  We're going to need more than that.
654499A8     //  Like I said, Lester was a great guy when he was winning. A really sunny, bright guy. Trouble was he hardly ever won. When he lost he was an evil son of a bitch.
342FEC89     //  Alright.
90BD3C85     //  Lester was playing cards out back.
09414F1F     //  He lost, of course, and wanted back in.
99ECB379     //  He suggested I earn the money on my back to get him a stake.
5D0554E2     //  That was the proposition he was putting to his so called buddies.
CB34C939     //  So maybe I was a little angrier than usual.
A0A145F7     //  Let's just say I took exception to his idea.
FA848F27     //  Don't lie to me. Something was different this time.
6EECA54D     //  You're clutching at straws.
D6811465     //  You married? The arguments are never any different.
36B6DB90     //  The bartender said that you and Leroy were planning to go into business together. Can you explain how you'll get the money to do that?
97BF56C2     //  I have a little money saved away.
4D5ABCD3     //  I thought Lester gambled all your money?
0F11A5C5     //  I made sure he didn't get his hands on it.
5470E451     //  Sabo has no money. This place can't be worth much. Where is the money coming from?
E579A744     //  My father left me this house and some money. Lester took out a second mortgage. I held onto the money and kept my mouth shut, and that's all I'm going to say on the subject.
4C953A0F     //  You're being economical with the truth, Lorna.
78F0C22E     //  You want to back that up, little man?
9E037A01     //  You really don't have any idea, do you? You're making a royal fool of yourself here.
3F606F4B     //  You increased the premium on Lester's life insurance.
8221248B     //  GI insurance policies have a $10,000 payout.
C1084A83     //  It was Leroy's idea. Lester lived on the edge. He was always getting into fights, crap games, pinochle, you name it. Turns out it was good advice.
739DBE7D     //  It speaks to motive and premeditation, Lorna.
5EB469C9     //  You're forgetting the hit and run, Detective.
943711FA     //  Did you know you're missing a knife, Mrs Pattison?
8BB82A94     //  Do you mean to say you've been ransacking my kitchen?
56DFE8CE     //  Any idea where the knife might be?
4E704906     //  Look at me.
EDD9E5A1     //  Do you think housewife was the life I was cut out for?
14DEE3EA     //  I do my best around here, but I couldn't tell you how many forks and spoons are in that kitchen.
F9ECB99F     //  You're holding out on us, Lorna. Where is the knife?
0C4BC015     //  Down the back of the sofa?
8A9F760B     //  In the garden?
051A994A     //  How the hell should I know?
E41CF282     //  You need to back off the throttle, little man.
E1AD11F8     //  I think Lester carried it for protection, and I think you know where it is.
06F72E29     //  And how do you work that one out?
D6E04247     //  Lester used his fists.
1F97DAC6     //  I should know.
64CBC49F     //  I'm tired of this and all your dumb questions. I think you'd better go now.
CAC75E10     //  You're missing a knife, Mrs Pattison.
8BB82A94     //  Do you mean to say you've been ransacking my kitchen?
9E6982FA     //  Any idea where that knife might be?
DE427115     //  Look at me. Do you think housewife was the life I was cut out for? I do my best around here, but I couldn't tell you how many forks and spoons are in that kitchen.
F087552A     //  We found a matching knife in the alleyway behind Ray's Cafe. It was covered in blood.
706FF1EC     //  Lester must have taken it.
C9E8E9B1     //  Gambling is a rough career.
72BEF229     //  Things sometimes go out of hand.
276A9286     //  You're lying. You took the knife. You wanted to provoke Lester but the car made that all unnecessary.
A4F6F149     //  Nice theory.
95A09247     //  Have you got any proof?
16F5DEF6     //  I'm not going to put up with this any longer.
D30254A1     //  You can't hang this on me.
BB9F26C1     //  Lester was hit by a car.
5DFFC9EB     //  I wasn't driving it.
80D5DCD0     //  I didn't love him, I admit it, but that's not a crime.
1CF925B2     //  You can only feel sorry for someone for so long before you begin to despise them.
834270D9     //  A woman can never find a man who wants to listen.
7972A419     //  You think I've got nothing better to do? Beat it.
7A64C732     //  You and your friend can get lost.
4A462ECA     //  I'm not giving you any more.
958F2E67     //  I'm not naive enough to expect an apology. Just get the hell out.
1A107D75     //  Lester could be a heel, but
7578ABF1     //  that's a lousy way for anyone to go out.
42C6EB67     //  You know,
B2F2C187     //  I don't really feel like talking to you right now.
0BFC9710     //  You and Mr Sabo have an interesting day.
AC8A9C11     //  I'm sure we will, Officer. Now if you could both just leave?
EC73046C     //  We're leaving, ma'am. Sorry for your loss. I can see what a tough time you're having with all this.
F5E0F0B9     //  We're leaving, Lorna. But this doesn't add up. We'll be keeping an eye on you.
906A8733     //  Come on, Phelps. Let's make ourselves scarce.
37BDB0AD     //  Did Lester Pattison fall, or was he pushed?
5A606BDA     //  That's a very good question. Those two were obviously conspiring, but Lester's death was an accident.
3957A6BA     //  We're missing something. We either rework the crime scene or find out what the coroner's come up with. I say we see Carruthers back at the morgue.
8B09A905     //  Any messages for me?
9310267C     //  Just one, Detective, from the coroner.
5C451CDC     //  Message reads: Phelps - See me at Central Morgue immediately.
F073C737     //  Results of the Pattison autopsy.
1C9989DA     //  Detectives. Thanks for coming down.
E49BC2CA     //  We can put the driver in front of a judge in less than a week.
6BA9F3D9     //  You'd be making a big mistake.
9CD16AB7     //  Run that by me again?
43486D42     //  The victim was dead before the car hit him. Two puncture wounds to the right side of the thorax. Second puncture reached his heart.
87700857     //  You're kidding me.
8A76FB21     //  Been doing this job twenty-three years, son, and no-one has ever laughed at one of my jokes.
ED4C45B2     //  He was stabbed to death?
B2AA4E84     //  Long sharp knife. Length of a bayonet.
46E530EF     //  So the hit and run was a cover up.
F704793A     //  I'd say he was stabbed twice at very close quarters.
A94F5C5C     //  Both wounds thrusting upwards. Then pushed in front of the car.
07284F2A     //  Easy, tiger.
F9986179     //  Clever, really. I almost missed it. The trajectory of the wounds was all wrong if he was impaled by the hood ornament. Find the knife, Detectives.
83C61261     //  Find the knife, Detectives.
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
E49BC2CA     //  We can put the driver in front of a judge in less than a week.
6BA9F3D9     //  You'd be making a big mistake.

1516B6FF     //  We found a knife in the alleyway.
7D87F7CB     //  Where is it now? Was it bagged?
F65AAD7B     //  By Patrolman Kaplan.
7804CC68     //  Perfect. I'll get you a definite match.
B4C14CE9     //  Jesus... we've got them. Murder One. We were right there, and they tried to stare us down. Now they'll both get the gas chamber.
FDD93858     //  You again? If you don't mind, I'm really busy.
136C1E77     //  We promised we'd keep you updated, Mrs Pattison. We've spoken to the coroner, and this is now a Homicide investigation. We'll take that look around now.
A66CFFC0     //  If you must.
1A4E8782     //  We've spoken to the coroner, Mrs Pattison.
11FAF181     //  He confirmed your husband's cause of death.
FC3DF590     //  We'd like you to come Downtown and
4EA83234     //  answer some questions.
C2C89CCB     //  It wasn't me. It was Leroy's idea.
66B1E2B0     //  Leroy stabbed him. I had nothing to
C9077FB4     //  do with it.
703449D4     //  Where is Leroy now?
3879C32A     //  He's in the bedroom...
38468329     //  You're very good, Lorna...
B4B580E2     //  Put the gun down, Leroy.
E585E67D     //  If you do something stupid now, you don't stand a
7D972317     //  Nice of you to give me up, sweetheart.
37DAAFC7     //  Shut up, Leroy. Shut up.
62B51399     //  All that planning. How to get him into the street, how to make it look like an accident.
D89122C4     //  For God's sake, Leroy, shut up.
8E8499DB     //  You think I'm going to fry for you, Lorna?
E8A8EAC6     //  He's a crazy man. Shoot him. Shoot him, for God's sake.
FA848388     //  Go! Just go! I'll check on her.
816DD929     //  You look spooked, Phelps.
95685367     //  I thought you'd been under fire before.
657398E4     //  It never gets any easier, Bekowsky.
302A570A     //  You guys back again, huh?
4E9E36B9     //  We just wanted to check the crime scene over one more time, Mr Sabo. If that's alright?
D9306883     //  Can you be quick about it? 
8290C2E4     //  Cops are bad for business.
C01A2545     //  Really? We'll tiptoe, Sabo. You won't even notice us.
AE7E5F19     //  Leroy Sabo,
B17B7C26     //  you're under arrest for the murder of Lester Pattison.
5CB74779     //  Not gonna happen, fellas.
D750BEC2     //  Go! I'll bring the car around and head him off!
E5F9D0F9     //  He's making for the roof, Cole! The fire escape, quick!
816DD929     //  You look spooked, Phelps.
95685367     //  I thought you'd been under fire before.
51EBEAC8     //  Never gets any easier, Bekowsky.
816DD929     //  You look spooked, Phelps.
95685367     //  I thought you'd been under fire before.
51EBEAC8     //  Never gets any easier, Bekowsky.
8911B460     //  You know what bugs me? 
1AB14AF8     //  Someone still hit that guy and didn't stop. 
37EF17E6     //  As soon as the address on that red Lincoln comes through, I'll send a prowl car to bring the driver in.
C60B84A0     //  Let's get to Ray's Cafe. Take a look at the hit and run while the scene's still fresh.
4F66372D     //  It might be worth working the scene again. Back to Ray's.
6406FE9B     //  We need to check in with the reporting officer. Then Carruthers. Make sure we know all the details.
B8C5F395     //  There's evidence smeared all over the street, Phelps. You'll need to search the whole area.
2007D6FF     //  Witness statements next. We know we've got the girl as an eyeball, but we should check the bar as well.
F9AC2A9F     //  We've gotta track down that Lincoln, Phelps. We find the car, and then we nail the driver.
CCD75878     //  What the hell, Phelps? That was our driver, and he's doing a bunk!
DEEE74E6     //  No more running for this guy. Go ahead - you talk to him.
CE0F070A     //  We have the address. Let's speak to the next of kin.
E855FAEF     //  That Pattison place stinks in my book.
910F0E69     //  We should really find out what's going on.
7C5EB951     //  Let's speak to the wife and get this over with.
9210D081     //  We need to prove the knife came from this house.
4DF9184C     //  We should go, Phelps. I've never felt less welcome in my entire life.
FEDD7056     //  The autopsy result might have come back. Call in.
91CB78C1     //  Back Downtown for the autopsy report. Let's see what the coroner makes of Lester Pattison.
5E2DF16A     //  The body is ninety percent of our evidence, Phelps. We need to see what Carruthers has to say about it.
A35C3B52     //  The full report will go into the case file,
D3A0FA22     //  but Carruthers could probably give you what he has now,
BAC45C82     //  if you go talk to him.
33124162     //  We have the knife, we have the coroner's report and I bet we could roll Sabo as a witness. Let's bring her in.
053692F5     //  Come on, Phelps. Pattison is guilty. All we have to do is bang on the door and pinch her.
520B3E1C     //  I say we do it clean and fast. Hit her with the evidence, and pack her off to Central. Go.
75E09F6B     //  It all comes back to the crime scene. 
73B58AD1     //  We need to hit Ray's one more time and trawl for evidence.
BBBB86F8     //  You remember what the coroner said? We don't leave Ray's until we find the last piece of that puzzle.
ACBCC848     //  We should speak to Leroy. Just so he knows we're sniffing around.
333E88FD     //  Alright. Step by step, check every inch of ground.
977C83D5     //  The knife is cause enough to pinch Leroy. Let's get inside and ask him what it's doing in his trashcan.
A7702E3F     //  So, I give you a hit and run, you bring me back fraud, conspiracy and first degree murder.
7A7554EC     //  This is how a good detective operates, Phelps.
C8008B68     //  You take nothing at face value,
D69C6AE9     //  you keep digging and asking questions until you get to the truth.
A55603EF     //  You've got some sharp elbows on you, Detective.
CCF974F6     //  I like that.
280582BC     //  Keep up the good work.
C2D529AB     //  No, Detective, no.
B723413D     //  You just keep your goddamn mouth shut and listen to me for a second.
0582B00D     //  One complaint, I can keep that in a drawer, no one has to know about it.
1B9570D9     //  Two, three, even four complaints, I can square that with the Board.
18B86BDA     //  But a full fucking dozen?
CD68B23D     //  Harassment, destruction of public property, conduct unbecoming...
F71D82AD     //  Jesus Christ!
935AEF5E     //  You better get out there and bring me a fistful of street crimes
76AAC8A9     //  if you want to keep your badge.
7BE4798F     //  Pickpockets, parking violations, I don't give a fuck.
F6EDF493     //  Just get out of my sight.
339C52D5     //  Sure, no problem.
62FFFD1D     //  Stalling just makes us more inquisitive, Lynch. We'll get to the bottom of this with or without you.
5B76D6E9     //  So what was he doing outside? It's against licensing regulations to drink on the sidewalk.
E5487A60     //  Why was Lorna Pattison in such a hurry to leave? What is going on here?
93F9CF3C     //  Lorna was pretty upset, so Leroy took her home.
5DC2AE23     //  Lorna and Leroy are close.
FE133692     //  They have been talking about opening a new bar.
E11361C3     //  You know what they were fighting about, Lynch.
48132EF4     //  Stop lying to me.
F1329D6C     //  So now you know what I know? You a mind reader now?
096F6897     //  I thought not.
2767FC5A     //  Do you want to accuse me of anything else now?
789018F3     //  How long have Lorna and Leroy been talking about this new bar?
2CA67790     //  Who knows? I just serve the drinks.
3947541D     //  You must have heard something.

E0849AAF     //  The only thing keeping this place afloat are the poker games.

0F73D17F     //  Me and Lorna?
AFCC9CA0     //  That man-eater?
8D5666A9     //  I wouldn't last a weekend with her.
1D52EA4F     //  You're barking up the wrong tree there, partner.
D72336B6     //  You finished scratching around? I've got work to do before I close up. You know the way out.
EB84BC97     //  He walked straight into the path of an oncoming car.
252F1122     //  So he turned blind?
61582344     //  Yes. He was still yelling at me when the car hit him.
111C6F3B     //  You expect me to believe that, Lorna? It's all very convenient.
584FF969     //  Gambling for Lester was like the needle for a hophead. He was yelling at me. He was yelling at the whole world. I kind of felt sorry for the driver. The poor guy had no chance.
0A8B4979     //  You're lying, Lorna. You pushed him in front of the car.
736C3A0C     //  If you think you can prove that, I suggest you arrest me now.
1ADB6E85     //  I would have loved to push him under a car, many a time. But not this time.
0E78AB09     //  Admit it - you were baiting him, pushing his buttons. We can easily get the full story from the regulars in the bar.
41CE03B5     //  Not one of your favorite customers?
BB0C3C3B     //  Lester was special, but not my kind of special.
5585F498     //  Was Lester drinking alone?
3EE9D94F     //  No, he came here with his wife.
FA93E481     //  She didn't seem too interested in the booze, though.
2E60E717     //  I'm not trying to hide anything. Just if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not speak ill of the dead.
807D90E0     //  So Pattison just walked in front of the car and you saw nothing? Why are you lying, Lynch?
7A040728     //  Any of the patrons will confirm I was here behind the bar when it happened. Can you prove any different?

471AE84D     //  All that whispering in my ear. 
8E417FE8     //  Telling me how we had to get rid of him, how good it could be, all the money we could claim...

0F9AE4F1     //  You had all the bases covered, baby.
7A412167     //  I had nothing to do with it.
D9C0B994     //  Do you believe him?
DA8EF5DA     //  I believe he didn't mow down the victim on purpose. The rest of it stinks. His boohoo story about being a surveyor and not wanting to lose his license.
08DFCD3B     //  Well, we'll see how he enjoys surveying the same tiny room for the next ten years of his life. You make a mistake, you face the consequences. You don't run off and hide like some little girl hoping it'll all go away.
1F8C7CBF     //  People make bad decisions in the heat of the moment

F55A9D1A     //  6232 Hollywood Boulevard.
F1B495B8     //  Sounds like a Homicide beef.
CDF28F8E     //  Two of the dead guys caught in the crossfire were carrying Army surplus morphine. Get over there before Homicide tramples all over the place.
674D0950     //  We already cleared that up.
CF52EA50     //  Judge in Pasadena took the big sleep yesterday. 
00009D2D     //  He had a personal stash of twenty syrettes. 
85B08B01     //  Appears we didn't get all of it.
206FB33A     //  Go to it, Detective. I have nothing further to say on the subject.
D3AF2421     //  Get over to the crime scene and see what you can turn up.
3DDCEE7B     //  Parker and Green are going toe to toe for the top job. There's a change in the wind.
DA76E7CA     //  About time.
A668ACA5     //  This wind'll be like a tornado, Phelps. Parker's got a puritanical streak. You never know who will get swept up in a thing like that.
3FE7AE98     //  Homicide guys are already inside.
49E144E3     //  Looks like a warzone in there. You've got your work cut out for you. Best get on with it.
9EFAE04D     //  The sooner you get this thing cleaned up, the sooner I can get back to my beat.
4DC1E454     //  Take a look around, Phelps. Looks like a straightforward execution to me.
9C68C46C     //  You'll have my report when it's ready. Right now you want to be examining evidence.
F19D98DB     //  I've got about sixty rounds to dig out of the walls. 
6D0AAEA8     //  Could we do this later?
D0608A05     //  I'll be bagging evidence for the next four hours.

2CB8FC80     //  Quit stomping around me or all these are gonna come out blurred. Go do some work for a change.

91F0877A     //  Bekowsky.
544150D8     //  Phelps. Back again?
D3C85CBE     //  We're here about the morphine.
4A602E59     //  Over by the bandstand. You can see what's left of the owner. Eddie McGoldrick, twenty-six, former Marine.
00CC9AF6     //  I know Eddie McGoldrick. He was a non-comm in my old unit.
EA707E5E     //  I'm sorry to hear that, Cole. Waitress said he recently came into some money and bought the club.
B6B61268     //  Who are the other vics?
3FBFA0E1     //  Two musicians. Bittleston and Bowe. Get this - they used to be in a four-piece but the trombone player and the drummer OD'd.
47BCC4AD     //  Don't tell me. Lamont and Tyree. 
94C5DCB1     //  We've met the rest of the band.
4731B659     //  Now they're a no-piece.
18DE028B     //  Do you mind if we take a look around?
02765A9E     //  Be my guest. You might want a word with the hostess too. I'll keep her company until you're ready.
AE180A0E     //  Phelps, work the morphine angle. I'll work the stiffs.
D51483FE     //  Captain wants this one cleared up quick. Let me know how it goes with the dope.
13ECEB34     //  .45 calibre. From the spread, looks like a Thompson.
4989D7F0     //  Do we have a new source, or is this coming from what's left in circulation?
A04F2884     //  Well-maintained, custom case. Someone cared for this instrument.
9C0F2E70     //  What's that click?
1B58D3E6     //  Neat trick. The case must have cost more than the trumpet.
8B58254D     //  We should follow up on the musician angle.
FC49ADDB     //  He kept his stash close at hand.
7A8C2D2D     //  This guy had a long term habit.
53D5D145     //  Must have pumped a dozen rounds into him. Certainly sends a message.
ABE8EB88     //  They didn't even try to crack the safe.
9D32C247     //  Bad luck, Eddie. Okinawa couldn't kill you, but knowing the wrong people in this city...
F5490E3E     //  Was this guy hunting for bear? Look at these things...
0B2F9E46     //  They're BARs. You get the odd guy who sneaks one of them home from the war. How did he get three of them?
2BC84F27     //  Dozen packs to a carton, a hundred cartons or more. Looks like a couple of months supply.
450F0F82     //  These look brand new. Never fired. They haven't been degreased yet. We could check on the serial numbers.
019BB102     //  Army surplus again. McGoldrick must have been moving contraband through the club.
9DF42FF8     //  Ma'am, I'm Detective Phelps. Administrative Vice squad.
4F02ED86     //  Welcome to the 111 Club, Detective. 
30192CCE     //  Feels like I've had half the LAPD in here today already.
DEC016D1     //  Any idea who did the shooting?
30AD51FD     //  No idea. It was my day off. 
2DD244E2     //  If I'd been here, honey, I'd be full of holes just like the others.
3CE12504     //  Well, you must have some thoughts?
F9863D12     //  We get all types in here, Officer.
1EB15EE3     //  You want to level with me, Miss Volkert, before we start taking an interest in you?
946534C1     //  This place has been on the slide for years. Eddie turns up, buys the club, then we start getting visits from tough guys. Next thing you know we have the St Valentine's Day Massacre. Are you getting the picture?
259364C5     //  What's this all about, Miss Volkert? Is Eddie behind on the vig?
913FF348     //  Eddie paid cash, sugar. I have no idea what enemies he might have had.
A54D2FFC     //  I'm not your problem here, Detective. Whatever Eddie was up to, he didn't share with me or the staff.
CB739E27     //  Army surplus morphine, Army surplus weapons, Army surplus Valors. Sound familiar?
4632E286     //  We should get back to the station and check the details of what exactly was lifted from that ship.
3FCBB7FD     //  Tell us about Eddie.
E800E542     //  Eddie didn't know a thing about running a nightclub. He came into some money and waltzed in and bought the place. The previous owner thought all his Christmases had come at once.
919B6F8F     //  Where do you think he got the money?
EFCEFA36     //  My guess was that he was selling the sort of quality product that you don't need to advertise.
747E01A7     //  That's some suggestion you're making about a former United States Marine.
10A7E43B     //  Marine or no, Eddie was in over his head. Sorry if I hurt your feelings.
82C4EBCA     //  You're lying. Eddie had enemies. You must have seen them?
343907A1     //  They allow you to booze on the job, Detective? It's giving you funny ideas.
35E2A313     //  When you're ready to have a civil conversation, we can try again.
B9963360     //  I hope you have a plan.
0AF24920     //  I think that's all there is. You better excuse me, honey.
B4CBDF33     //  If you're done, I gotta close this place up and notify staff.
2C12435D     //  This how you usually solve a crime?
057D15D5     //  Come on back and ask your question. I don't bite.
B659F291     //  Thank you for your help, ma'am.
E1F733B3     //  Eddie was in over his head but he was a decent boss.
57B0B469     //  We're trying to find out who's behind this, ma'am. You're not making it any easier.
3FC80AFD     //  Well, you're not being much of a gentleman, honey. You boys take care now.
C258A85B     //  What's going on?
725C37EE     //  That fucking rat Stoker has gone public about Brenda.
8DB391DB     //  Who is Brenda?
01C0460C     //  Brenda is LA's most famous madam.
5D3230FD     //  And everyone knows it?
FA415665     //  Of course everyone knows. Brenda pays her way.
3B4B9085     //  Are we cops or a collection agency?
133E2D6E     //  Whores have been around since the Bible. Our job is to keep it off the street so Joe Citizen and his wife can stroll around unmolested.
5215B7E2     //  Then we should change the law.
63914942     //  Are you out of your mind? Every politician in America is against prostitution, except when they're using them.
8F335087     //  So where does Stoker come in?
F087E8DC     //  He objects to the LAPD and the administration taking its cut.
8FEFA080     //  Is everyone in on this?
2CAE51E6     //  Yeah, and that's the problem. 
0BE8AE27     //  From a little acorn does a large tree grow. 
8E6DE188     //  He could bring the whole thing crashing down on us.
85DDDD5D     //  Aren't you supposed to be working the...
C82BAA1C     //  Sir, do you know which Robbery detectives are working the Army surplus theft from the Coolridge?
078A177A     //  Caldwell and McManus. 
146AD230     //  I saw Caldwell in the squad room not long ago if you want to speak to him.
8AC1FD15     //  Thank you, sir. We'll do that.
235FE9A3     //  This way.
071E0C99     //  Get to it, Detective.
43BDEF95     //  If you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I have other cases.
B14FBDAD     //  Harry. You got a minute?
39D3573F     //  Sure, Cole. Anytime.
2BF19280     //  You been working the docks robbery on the SS Coolridge?
715B7D85     //  Yeah, that's right.
CDAFDE64     //  So how do you see it?
950FF3F2     //  Inside job. Either the guys working the wharves or some of the guys on the ship.
7B5CD56A     //  What else was taken apart from the morphine?
2E4019DC     //  Case of BARs. Case of Thompsons. Crate of Valor smokes.
8BBC9536     //  Homicide just recovered three BARs and a mountain of cigarettes at a shooting at the 111 Club.
27947C41     //  No kidding? I better get over there.
BB66B56B     //  Do you have a copy of the manifest?
D40B9796     //  Yeah. Here it is.
3AFA6AC4     //  So how do we connect the docks robbery to the mess at the 111 Club?
70BDBEB5     //  Here he is. McGoldrick, Eddie.
DD94A437     //  Here's our backroom arsenal from the 111 Club.
3E3A68AD     //  Enough to arm three companies.
233BC1CA     //  This is the crate we recovered.
EA252F85     //  Half a million syrettes loose on the streets of LA.
518146DC     //  Some of these guys are from my old unit. They must have finally shipped home. Kelso, Sheldon... McGoldrick.
4187272D     //  McGoldrick was on the boat?
40438B66     //  Sure. We checked him out.
DC5A44B2     //  McGoldrick bought the 111 Club, Harry. His brains are all over the bar.
94D760B3     //  Looks like whoever stole the dope is getting muscled.
B987E984     //  By whom?
C6236380     //  Dragna or Cohen. They control the hop.
7F348267     //  Sounds like I'd better get down to the 111 Club. Thanks for the tip, Phelps. See you around.
18D11AA3     //  Let's catch up soon, Cole. Now I got to get back to work.
5C800529     //  Detectives! KGPL is going crazy. Shots fired at 1384 North Bronson - some guy with an automatic spraying a Hollywood bus. They want every car. Go!
B7C11703     //  I heard you were in the Blue Room the other night. Shouldn't you have been at home, tucked in bed with the wife and kids?
D3F0B11F     //  Where I go is your business?
9D089AAF     //  It couldn't have had anything to do with a certain delightful but damaged German girl, could it?
36252AA9     //  I don't know what you're talking about, Roy.
3E57A3B3     //  I check coats. That's all I get paid to do.
EAB7D459     //  Excuse me. I've got to sort through some unclaimed items right now.
0EF98A99     //  Take a break, boys.
93F8A2CA     //  We would like them to stay, Miss Lichtmann. We're making inquiries into the recent deaths of four musicians.
E03C0937     //  Since when have the police cared about dead black men?
F9ED717E     //  Good point - we don't. 
66C1A0EF     //  What we care about is two tons of Army surplus morphine showing up on the street. 
D0CC2C24     //  If you care about working in this town, you better give me something on Bittleston and Bowe, 
30364200     //  or their knucklehead buddies Tyree and Lamont.
A7D76A33     //  And this is your idea of making enquiries, Untersturmführer?
63E37FB8     //  I've told you a thousand times about speaking that German gibberish at me, Elsa.
CAF7B9AA     //  Roy, how about you get a drink while I see to this?
0EE2E88E     //  Will you sit down?
30B3093C     //  Why antagonize him, Elsa? You know what he's capable of.
503F1E34     //  Ask your questions, Herr Officer. We have work to do.
5FE754CE     //  My partner mentioned a couple of names. You recognize them?
238C04EB     //  I have no idea what you are talking about.
EC479E8A     //  They frequented the Blue Room. 
0CC2EA72     //  They were musicians. Are you sure?
39D3562B     //  Yes, I'm very sure.
1CAAC12B     //  The only way you are going to get rid of me is to give me an answer.
5DB19647     //  I knew Cornell. We worked together a few years ago. He loved the music but the music didn't love him.
97497996     //  What does that mean?
C54F18C4     //  It means that he just wasn't that good. He was a sad, lonely cat.
3930B816     //  I don't believe you. You knew these men.
A8BCCD25     //  And how would you like to prove that, Detective?
18B0243A     //  You're out of your depth here, Detective, and you're asking the wrong questions of the wrong people.
E7ECE7CA     //  People are dying of overdoses. 
BC9BB853     //  If you know anything about it, you need to tell me.
40FC9414     //  I can't help you.
49FAAEA6     //  A lot of cats are into the thing. That's nothing special about your boys.
AEDE87C6     //  I'm not looking to arrest users. I'm after the supply.
7CA18C8A     //  You just don't get it, do you? Some people can't live without heroin.
7737B26E     //  You can do this the easy way, with me, or I can call my partner back over. I can assure you he's a lot less sensitive.
39082660     //  You think your threats frighten me?
05FDFF71     //  Black man don't supply nothing. 
48801F7A     //  You think that there is a black man in this town holding onto two tons of morphine? 
971B5561     //  He'd be dead in a minute. 
C74C0A59     //  White man supplies. Black man buys.
94C5F81C     //  Hopheads appear to get a free pass at this club. You all know about the morphine.
1366639B     //  And how do you expect to prove that?
9FA466E3     //  I have a rehearsal to finish. It's time for you to leave.
092D7DEF     //  Boys, take five minutes, please. I need to have a private word with the officer.
949138DC     //  Why do you ask people to risk talking about a subject that could have them jailed?
D697E091     //  Drugs are against the law, Elsa.
E3878672     //  Are you so full of courage you have never felt ashamed?
90155E92     //  This is getting us nowhere.
4062E199     //  Do you think you will win your war against narcotics?
17E50D24     //  It's not my war. It's against the law. My job is to prosecute the laws of this city.
5968A92F     //  Do you think you can stop people from needing drugs, Detective?
F8DE4E41     //  I'm asking the questions here!
B522A62D     //  Then why do you come to me with your stupid questions? You know who controls the drugs in this city.
92D11106     //  It's not enough to just survive, Elsa. You have to try and make the world a better place...
A6B6409E     //  Brave words and very noble. But words are just words, Cole Phelps.
BFAAFC25     //  She's right. We need to pay a visit to the Mickster.
7807F158     //  Cohen. You know where to find him?
49060B02     //  This time of day, you'll find him holding court at the Mocambo.
687CE957     //  Leave me alone. I have nothing more to say to you.
8ECE5246     //  No more questions. Arrest me or leave me to do my work.
F8A00ADA     //  Do something. Don't just stand there all day.
9F066164     //  Do you wish to finish the interview?
D31DF458     //  I think you got about just as much as you're gonna get, policeman.
ECB450F0     //  You can tell your drug story again if you want, but I heard it a thousand times. I got nothing more to say on that.
8D92981E     //  I don't know nothing about your morphine, mister.
3A284001     //  You better get going. You probably got a lot of jazz clubs to visit and a lot of colored boys to shake down.
60AB6695     //  It's pointless prohibiting something if the demand is still there.

BDFACEE4     //  You want a city full of hopheads, Phelps?
F61CF97F     //  The same argument was made with booze. Repealing prohibition would create a society of alcoholics. Not exactly how it turned out. We should be spending our time trying to fight real crimes, not trying to manage people's addictions.
BF4E3927     //  Phelps, you should keep this stuff to yourself. You sound like some kind of pinko nut job. Society needs things to demonize. Makes everyone feel good.
D5FCE620     //  Gentlemen. A table for two?
C7F5CC24     //  LAPD. We're looking for Meyer Cohen? I believe he has lunch here.
7DB3A412     //  There's not going to be any trouble, is there?
5DFBA342     //  Which table?
05D79721     //  Number three. If you'll follow me?
3443EE12     //  Sirs? Mr Cohen's table is this way.
C91D1778     //  Your business is with Mr Cohen. I have a restaurant to manage.

4C1CB964     //  If you'd care to follow me outside, sir, away from the customers, there's an alleyway where I'm sure we can straighten out our differences.
A850651D     //  Gentlemen. Messrs Cohen and Stompanato.
4F326DB7     //  LAPD. We have some questions regarding...
6E469A3A     //  Hi, Mickey. How's it hanging?
4B4ED74A     //  Fine. Just fine, Roy. 
87A6717C     //  I see you brought eager beaver along. 
A8972D6B     //  Hope he's not going to put the shakes on me again.
BE20B328     //  Cole Phelps. Mickey Cohen.
1FE7E95D     //  Good afternoon.
8C3D54AA     //  He has manners. 
E1664B6A     //  Aren't you a little green for this, kid?
1917B756     //  Meet Johnny Stompanato, Cole. He has the biggest schlong in Hollywood and the smallest gun. Or maybe that's the other way around. I can never quite remember.
6FE0D1FA     //  You're a funny guy, Roy. 
E9C06ECD     //  Haven't I always said what a funny guy Roy is, 
9AEB66F2     //  and how much fun it would be to get together with him sometime?
71B6A03B     //  Poor Johnny - he's the dark, sensitive type. He's a serviceman too, Cole. Johnny was at Okinawa.
E14F59A4     //  You were in the crotch?
AB6FAE52     //  Sixth Marines.
421586CB     //  The Lieutenant who won the Silver Star up on Sugar Loaf. I've heard of you.
12622474     //  Something like that.
D6EE88E8     //  Alright, have we finished flirting? You got something to discuss, Roy, or are you gonna stand around beating the meat while my lunch gets cold?
7CD463F0     //  We have some questions.
12EA4781     //  Do I need my lawyer?
7F64D05C     //  Your brother-in-law, Lenny Finkelstein, was selling stolen morphine. He had one third of the shipment.
8C5B8962     //  Old news, kid. 
E342D00D     //  I don't know anything about what Lenny was up to.
74186232     //  Word is that Jack Dragna is closing you out. You're going to need friends, Mr Cohen. We need that morphine.
BC96BC2A     //  Dragna? He's an old woman, alright? 
37D83C08     //  He's frightened to cross the road. 
A3D9063A     //  Listen, I don't need your help, boychik. 
28D0F0F3     //  I got plenty of friends at the LAPD already.
A1D4BBC7     //  So I'm supposed to believe that you don't know what happened to the rest of the shipment?
E5982648     //  Lenny - God rest his soul - was a moron. 
9C42D3F3     //  He was family though, and I haven't made a beef about that so count yourself lucky, kid. 
C4A43DAB     //  The H is a filthy habit. And I don't condone it. 
906DFD5E     //  The simple solution would be to have all the dope fiends put down.
B4821602     //  So you don't know where he got the morphine?
45274D8B     //  Kid, ask a question you might get an answer to.
4DBA5074     //  Jack Dragna has you on the run. 
BEEEC973     //  You're muscling the guys who stole the morphine from the ship.
35E9C203     //  You calling me a liar, kid? 
A6B98040     //  You think you can prove that in court?
F6DD4511     //  Nice try, kid. 
7621A0A5     //  But you're going to have do a lot better than that.
10489372     //  We believe there's a link between a group of Marines and the morphine stolen from the SS Coolridge. One of those Marines was shot to death in a club last night.
3CDE806E     //  I wouldn't know anything about that.
C94EBF39     //  Lenny wasn't smart enough to run this operation. He was strictly distribution. This smells of a deal gone wrong.
12513BED     //  You're very perceptive, boychik. But you could never shake hard enough to get me to give it up.
AD73CEA5     //  So you haven't heard anything about what happened at the 111 Club?
DD71148F     //  What can I say, kid? I'm shocked that, in the land of opportunity, Uncle Sam's finest feel the need to resort to crime. It's a dangerous business. I can attest to that. I'd recommend they get out of the life quickly.
0145C562     //  I think you're lying. 
40488881     //  I think the 111 Club was your men. 
6C5CAEDB     //  I think you're trying to send a message.
F252DF03     //  I'll send you a message, kid. 
FBCAEE43     //  You better have some proof that that was one of mine, or else you better have health insurance.
B31F8D63     //  All of the scratching around in that little book is cute, kid. Run along now, huh?
2EBDFC88     //  A few negros saying goodbye on the sidewalk will never make the papers, Mickey, but we had a judge in Pasadena say adios the other day. Prominent white people popping their clogs makes everyone nervous.
0E51F780     //  You know dope has never been my thing, Roy. It's always been for schmendricks like Jack D and Jimmy Utley. But I'll ask around and I'll get back to you. Hey, you boys want some lunch? How about a drink?
62DABA82     //  We'll take a raincheck on that. Come on, Cole, we're leaving.
B20A79DB     //  We have to cut that dope. 
C9C8A224     //  It looks bad with people dying.
2B5AD6AC     //  We have to get the rest of it. 
7E29AC93     //  There's no way of watering down the stuff in those little packages. 
9A6DDB77     //  We have to put the squeeze on those guys and get the rest of it.
9BE1CE20     //  We'll see.
295DA4FD     //  They don't seem the type that frighten that easy.
DF1B65A9     //  We have to cut that dope. It looks bad with people dying.
B635224B     //  We have to get the rest of it. There's no way of diluting that stuff in those little packages. We need to put the squeeze on those guys and get the rest.
E7F8CF47     //  They don't seem the type that frightens that easy.
25089FD6     //  Kid, I'm at work here on my food. I grew up poor, so I don't abide with wasting good grub.
95334BC5     //  I hope you find the humps who did the 111. 
FDFCFA35     //  That kind of thing is bad for business. 
7B5D70A1     //  Goodbye, kid.
24395319     //  I think your bright spark might have blown a fuse, Roy. Hey, you still there, kid?
125069C0     //  I'm sorry, is this kid walking away from me? Back here, boychik.
F4C3C0F3     //  How about we cut this little talk short before I lose my temper?
31C1E5D0     //  Do us a favor. Vamoose, kid.

C32A7A85     //  This is my partner, Roy Earle. We just want to find out what happened.
16CB7B98     //  What happened is that someone took a shot at my bus and then cops turn up and start treating me like I'm some sort of pachuco punk. My people have been in California for over three hundred years.
71FC0DA9     //  Very fucking admirable, Felix.
350D2007     //  You hear anything about the big heist on the Coolridge?
C6200519     //  Yeah, I heard about it.
E2002940     //  So what happened?
9D1EF622     //  Not much. Cops came and interviewed me and all of the other guys on the ship.
94D56DA6     //  Felix, that morphine is turning up everywhere. People are dying. You got something you want to tell me?
767DE174     //  I'm a bus driver. Do I look like I run a dope racket?

3D0F5A6F     //  I heard that Eddie came into some money. 
A85A9C98     //  Too bad he didn't keep a low profile. 
77B9A2A5     //  It's a tough break to get through Okinawa and then have to buy it back home.
1AF5D218     //  I don't believe you, Felix. I've got gunmen blasting away at innocent citizens. This is getting out of hand. Is there something you want to tell me?
7623D438     //  I don't appreciate you calling me a liar, Detective. You want to prove that I was involved?

CDC019F3     //  I've got the LAPD to keep me safe, right? Me and all my people.
8F37F364     //  The dead guy on the roof works for Mickey Cohen. Why would Cohen want you dead?
193B1C6F     //  I don't know anything about Mickey Cohen or any of those gangsters.
28667816     //  Your name was in the sniper's notebook. Level with me, Felix.

D7253304     //  Yeah. You remember Sheldon, don't you, Cole?
76D2A7E8     //  You think I'd be dumb enough to get involved with people like that? No way.

444186B6     //  You heard that Jack is in LA?
81BFF8E2     //  I saw his name on the manifest.
7FB88C6D     //  He's been here a couple of months. Sure glad to see you got over your wound, Lieutenant. I mean... Detective.
E2DB84CA     //  I need to get down to the depot and see what they want to do about my shift.
814BBDC1     //  I quit taking orders when I left the Corps.

97AFBED5     //  My bus is full of holes. I would have thought you'd want some answers.
C1E76C8B     //  You know, you haven't changed one little bit. Get the fuck outta my face, Lieutenant.
3045870D     //  Pretty cool customer.
D7CDEE82     //  He's been under fire before.

B8D55FD3     //  Jack was a Company Sergeant. 
FCA221CB     //  He would never get involved in something like this.
3AAE5B67     //  We brace him and drag him Downtown.

1268A51E     //  Hello, Cole.

389D30A3     //  Do I have any choice?
CB69256E     //  No, you don't.
464F773E     //  Are you going to tell me what this is all about?
5189EFB4     //  It would be better for all of us if we discussed it at the station.
9ADB975B     //  Bad move, Cole.
5EED513D     //  So how have you been, Jack?
7078FFFE     //  Cut the crap. 
E8A8FD4D     //  You pick me up in front of my apartment like a common criminal and then expect small talk? 
23F7C5F9     //  Fuck you.
A6911F08     //  What do you know about the Army surplus robbery from the Coolridge, Jack?
523DE7C1     //  What I know is that on three separate occasions you

89F9599B     //  I don't know anything about the robbery.

F08664D5     //  Gratitude isn't a concept that has much effect on you, is it, Cole?
CC0B3EDF     //  Answer the question, Jack. Let's get this over with.
D31B9F37     //  I was interviewed when the robbery took place. I don't have anything further to add.
EADA1AA9     //  I don't believe you, Jack. You were there.

C09A104E     //  Not you, lad. You get on with your interrogation.
3D43FB0D     //  Roy can take care of himself, Detective Phelps. Back to your case.
F555E8BA     //  You're in Interview Two, Phelps. There's a quack in there with him.
3E63987F     //  What gives?
A399E006     //  Beats me. Word came down from the Chief. Said it was okay.
13E59BF2     //  Sheldon. Is this your attorney?
955558D6     //  No, Detective. This is Dr Harlan Fontaine. 
87040F9B     //  He came down here to help me out.
D29D5CC1     //  How do you do, sir?
1F3E71D2     //  You stole the morphine from the Coolridge.
8535DD34     //  You can't prove that.
5A40765B     //  Let's see if I can try. 
5BEB4B80     //  And what is your relationship to Sheldon, sir?
7D735754     //  Tutor, mentor. 
CC3D4D58     //  Mr Sheldon is a medical student of mine. 
8F9E99B1     //  He has a very bright future...
7B161670     //  That's nice to know. 
EA5586CC     //  Too bad all of your war buddies won't get to see your graduation.
0CA67757     //  You were on the ship, Sheldon.
1FD87E28     //  Yes, that's correct.
BE99454D     //  So you had opportunity?
68734715     //  But it doesn't mean that I was involved.
094CF075     //  How do you think this is going to play out, Courtney? 
ED5D1DB4     //  It's either going to be you or Jack.
FCBEEA48     //  What's this got to do with Jack? Jack would never be involved in anything like this.
8435D9C3     //  But you would.
232C5478     //  He has already denied any wrongdoing.
19414E30     //  So Eddie McGoldrick took his cut and bought the 111 Club?
D15B644F     //  I... I don't know what Eddie has been up to.
1E308478     //  So you don't mind that the mob executed McGoldrick, Driscoll and Beckett to get to you?
CDBFA2F0     //  I don't know why you're trying to pin this on me. Where's your proof?
F099964D     //  Beckett had a message for you before he died. "Bad luck... it was worth a try".
0E3C7497     //  I feel bad about Beckett, Phelps. He was a hard charger. Those guys deserved more. I don't blame them for taking their shot.
017F2425     //  We finished here, Cole?
67D83FB8     //  I would have asked Beckett or Majewski or Driscoll about their involvement but that's difficult, considering they're all dead. That leaves you, Sheldon.
FDC7864C     //  You can't blame their deaths on me, Phelps.
019EC2FB     //  So what are you going to do with your cut, Sheldon? You were probably the bravest man I ever saw, and you're acting like a low coward now.
A03FE7F4     //  I'd ask you not to answer that, dear boy. Do you have any real evidence, Detective?
9B0A4809     //  You're training to be a doctor, Courtney. How do you justify all of these deaths? You're supposed to want to save people.
2CF82C74     //  Before you get on your high horse, I saved my fair share on Peleliu and Okinawa. 
506050AC     //  My conscience is clear. How do you sleep at night?
4F69633F     //  You're lying, Courtney. The other guys aren't smart enough to attempt something like this. You either give it up or I go after Jack for it.
541D69EC     //  And how do you prove that, Cole?
45FE4810     //  We know about your showdown with Cohen. We found notes on your guys.
94D87B82     //  Cohen is hitting our old unit. 
E1E24C39     //  He believes we have the morphine. 
4FA75F78     //  I told him that we don't have it and that's the truth. 
9B17C9CE     //  Isn't it, Doc?
0B4A0DF9     //  I believe Mr Sheldon. I think he's telling the truth, Detective.
29719731     //  Jack isn't scared of you, Phelps. None of us were. We just followed your orders.
75B8F3A6     //  Have you finished, Detective?
5E7B9DD7     //  I'm just getting started. You have an answer for everything, Courtney. Let's hope Jack does, because now I'm going after him. Is there anyone you're not prepared to sacrifice?
ED9BAE97     //  Jack is not in this. He's a good guy.
C8448FF4     //  You or Jack, Courtney. I don't care who goes to jail. I just want the morphine off the street.
EEB0AAEF     //  What are you offering, Cole?
F2AEBC18     //  Don't be ridiculous, son. This man is gambling.
7AB55419     //  What's your offer?
FD906793     //  I don't know what else to tell you, Detective. That's it.
2CBFC204     //  You can ask all day long but I have nothing more to say.
4D70ED2A     //  Stare all you want. I have nothing to hide.
3F4503C1     //  I came down here of my own accord to help with your investigation and you're walking out?
52AB8D64     //  You may well be fascinating to speak to, Detective. But I charge by the half hour, and I guarantee you couldn't afford me.
D81E9A68     //  I've taken quite an interest in Mr Sheldon. So you can understand why it pains me to see him lambasted unnecessarily. Please leave us be.
6A6174CD     //  Doctor. Good to see you.
D216F8E8     //  I'm conducting an investigation...
5AFFC838     //  Upstairs in my office now.
C94418AC     //  This man is about to confess...
4C88B1F8     //  As of now, you're suspended from duty pending a fitness review.
C8E25565     //  What are you talking about?
74FC4E23     //  You heard the man, Phelps. Upstairs and face the music like the hero you were.
488AA275     //  Save it for the disciplinary hearing, Detective.
5DC012C6     //  You'll be back in uniform before the week is out if I have anything to do with it, Phelps. Out of my sight.
664F8673     //  You heard the man. Dope at the 111 Club. That's gotta be a first.
1616C4DC     //  We missed something in that mess at the 111. Let's go back.
4FA62282     //  Find out what's going on from the bulls in Homicide. 
8A3B2856     //  I'll look around.
C4C46288     //  Best search the place, Cole. All of the rooms - joint like this could have some funny stuff lying around.
58E0FEBE     //  Have a word with the broad when you're ready. Maybe she knows what went down.
CAC1B662     //  Back to the station. We need to speak to someone on the Robbery detail.
70E7D56F     //  Come on, Cole. Back to Hollywood Station. We have to find out where Eddie's stash came from.
EF0A045C     //  You worked with Caldwell, Cole. Go catch up and get the scoop on the investigation.
BDA20B42     //  Take a look at the manifest and see if we have a match.
8BD39D23     //  All these junkies seem to get a free pass to the Blue Room. How about we pay a visit?
81C8EBAA     //  Now I know a certain detective who would just love to go back to the Blue Room. Now why would that be, Cole?
C11379FD     //  Have a word with Elsa. And keep your mind on the job, huh?
1C49D264     //  It's time to pay Mickey a visit at the Mocambo.
785972A3     //  Mickey is a tough egg. We've gotta go back to the club and see if he cracks.
396715D0     //  Ask the maître d' to announce us.
E2775710     //  Mickey has been questioned a thousand times. See if you can do any better.
EDF70FFD     //  You heard the call, Cole. Shots fired. Put your foot down. We need to get to the bus stop.
33FA18CA     //  I say we go back to the bus stop, check the physical evidence and work the suspects.
252F538D     //  Where are the uniforms? Speak to them and find out what the hell's going on.
CE95140F     //  Check the dead guy's pockets and see if he has any ID.

6FED1945     //  We need to put Kelso under lights. Back to the station.
3687E54C     //  I think Kelso has you snowed. Get some answers out of the guy.
250ED0E4     //  We need to get to the diner before all your old pals get aced.
F5B453BE     //  Let's go back to the alley where we mopped up these goons. See if we missed something.
36B4E12F     //  Search the bodies, Cole. See if you can ID these guys.
35A34C3D     //  The post office, Cole. And be quick about it.
7BC34503     //  You think the vics at the Post Office had something on them that we missed? We could try there.
A7D82156     //  He was trying to tell us something when he died. You find anything on him?
BFD6AE25     //  We need to get to Grauman's before all these guys get whacked.
73D18663     //  If we can get them all in the alleyway we wrap the whole case.
10B4AE2D     //  This Sheldon guy is waiting at the station, Cole. I know he's your buddy but you have to bring the hammer down on these guys.
849A53EE     //  This Sheldon character is the the last man standing who can explain this shit. Let's get back to the station and have it out with him.
8DE872DB     //  You're on your own, partner. Get in that room and get a confession.
8EC554D2     //  You certainly had us fooled, Detective.
C5EF0FDA     //  Phelps, you're one of my favorite sons. You've broken this old man's heart.
31324655     //  What is this about, sir? I'm closing a case.
B81700FC     //  You're suspended, Phelps. Hand over your badge and gun.
59923EBA     //  Don't keep him waiting.
31656CA7     //  Sir, what is going on...
7B66B4AB     //  Your wife's attorney has pictures of you and the German. Compromising pictures, lad.
F9EEAABE     //  She is pressing charges. You'll be formally charged with adultery.
1A89EEDD     //  A criminal cannot serve as an LAPD officer, as I'm sure you're aware.
C94F6B05     //  I don't understand...
DB67BC67     //  How could you do it, lad? Your wife, your children... consorting with the enemy, and a dope fiend at that. You're lucky the war is over. You'd be taken out and shot.
5B0FFD57     //  The Department doesn't need this kind of publicity, Phelps. 
2FE3FB3D     //  Now hand over the gun and keep your head down until your board hearing. 
3408E9E3     //  I forbid you to make any comments to the press.
68158965     //  What the hell were you thinking?
0E70B8BD     //  Your other dead war buddy. You check his pockets too?
B41A3F40     //  We would like a word.
CFD667CB     //  Would you like to come inside?
F9D033F2     //  You want to level with me, Miss, before we start taking an interest in you?
4548A4D2     //  What's this all about? Is Eddie behind on the vig?
011F94C8     //  Quick, search them. Then let's get the hell out of here before we get dragged into the paperwork.
C16DC80F     //  Christ, I've looked at more stiffs than a cheap whore today.
1C53167D     //  We need to get ahead of this thing before everyone on that ship ends up dead.
7996C1DF     //  The Captain gave us a pretty simple remit.

9741A195     //  Majewski, Beckett, McGoldrick, Driscoll. These are good guys. 
00061ED2     //  Why did they get wrapped up in this thing?
D68D9F14     //  Not everyone has your unwavering restraint in the face of temptation, Cole.
F7A3B8B4     //  How many more friends of yours are gonna get plugged today?
153A66E8     //  Okay, hands in pockets. Let’s see who we got.
8194AF7A     //  You should check out our friend for identification, seeing as we weren't formally introduced.

449A387A     //  A dead judge. That's not good.

18B863A1     //  We go back a long way.
D92DFC92     //  You went too easy on him. Next time you leave it to me. I know how to handle that smug son of a bitch.
D908A581     //  You don't. Jack will never give up his own men.
524B2BDD     //  Everyone has their vices. Even you, Phelps.
C7FD0059     //  This isn't looking good. I feel like the fat kid at the back of a race.
AD037D66     //  You're sure it's Cohen making the hits?
C8180F7F     //  All fingers point his way. Your buddies are in way over their heads. Being a Marine doesn't mean shit out here.
411F74BF     //  How well did you know the owner?
887D5DD2     //  McGoldrick? Well enough. He was in my unit.
0ED047E9     //  That's some cruel irony. You survive the war, then get blown to pieces back home.
44310A47     //  It happens more than you'd think. Young guys, trying to adjust to normal life, getting mixed up in the wrong crowds.
2ADFB5F3     //  The kid had just bought a night club! I'd say he got mixed up in the right crowds.
F6D9C793     //  Until someone filled him full of holes.
F6F38E31     //  You don't come into that kind of money that quickly without pissing a few people off.

7C3DB2E2     //  There were a lot of people on that boat.
DDFD8802     //  Maybe you're behind this whole thing, Phelps. Wouldn't that be a masterstroke? Hey, cut me in early and we'll ride this one into the sunset.
E2246BB3     //  Sounds like you've got the case all sewn up, Roy. We should call it a day and go home.
3FE32AC6     //  And miss out on the Blue Room? I couldn't do that to you.

52F6E4B8     //  The fire brigade come and put it out. 
62A85356     //  Couple of hours later, she does it again, phones up Central and says

EDD8AFDA     //  That's what I'm here for.
D09AC8DA     //  You got the money?
6DBE0C88     //  The twenty? Sure. Right here.
A4CCC740     //  Twenty!
F5078FC2     //  I said...
9315352A     //  You want the money or the alternative?
6337FA49     //  Tell us about the reefer, Freddie.

0C9DEF68     //  Thanks for the twenty. 
EF0B172A     //  I'm outta here.
4236FE4E     //  I got a couple of things that I gotta go do. I told you what I know.

F466D038     //  I keep an eye on the neighborhood. I've got to run along now.
F19DAF5E     //  Suspect is down. In the house. Set up a perimeter and get Tech Services and the coroner down here.
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
C39B70CB     //  We'll handle the body, Detective. You need to pursue the case.
025B105E     //  Scene is secure, sir. You carry on with your investigation.
B912286F     //  You did well in there, Detective. We'll take over from here.

0FB82D28     //  This one is fixed to the...
E0103A9B     //  Now we're getting somewhere.
FAEAB5F8     //  More soup. Who in the hell keeps a secret stash of soup?
FCA7723B     //  I'd say that's pretty good value for twelve cents.
FDBD0200     //  Factory sealed. Someone at the cannery has a lot of explaining to do.
E27852A5     //  With Juan dead we need a new suspect, Cole. Is there a pattern to the deliveries?

5FF0D6AA     //  We should notify the border crossing.
3105649B     //  Those fuckers are probably in on it. 
BA2954F2     //  Let's wait and see how this plays out.
A77E534E     //  I need an address on a Parnell's Soup Company. A head office or factory in the Los Angeles area.
0E903C38     //  Just a second, Detective... only one address listed. 6310 Fountain Avenue.
DBFDADEC     //  Carruthers says the morphine is still turning up.

0042B099     //  LAPD. Who owns this factory, ma'am?
2FB1B039     //  Mr Parnell. Howard Parnell. I'll let him know you're here. Please take a seat.
5AC137E1     //  If you don't mind, we'll come with you.
A66CFFC0     //  If you must.
3260D4D7     //  I'm sorry, I'm just the receptionist here. I can't help you.
9B50A924     //  I hope things work out. I need the job, but they tell me nothing.
3888DF10     //  I'm sorry, Officer? Weren't we in the middle of something?
593E8630     //  If you could show these men in to see Mr Parnell, Doris? They're from the LAPD.
DE757BC0     //  Follow me, gentlemen.
7370FFAE     //  What is going on?
C927211B     //  LAPD. Sit tight, fatso. You could be in very serious trouble.
27597BC9     //  There's no reason to be rude. Doris, you may leave and close the door on your way out. Take a seat, gentlemen. I'm sure we can sort this all out.
6BE5A398     //  Maybe you could explain why we found five dollar bags of marijuana in sealed Parnell's soup cans?
02009C31     //  That's an outrageous allegation.
3637ABCE     //  How do you explain it, chubby? We found at least thirty cans. All sealed up tight with your label on them.
184D09D7     //  Can I get a list of your employees?
60598FD7     //  Of course. We have nothing to hide.
38EA7C2B     //  Doris - can you bring me in the current employee listing?
34921E56     //  Here it is, Mr Parnell.
AB4634F9     //  On the desk, please.
AF8719D0     //  Thank you.
3DAA208D     //  Any name on that list that rings a bell?
FDCF8AB8     //  This is familiar. 
5D2643B4     //  1452 North Las Palmas, a Jorge Garcia Cruz.
4536004B     //  Ever heard of Juan Garcia Cruz?
7AB8F8D6     //  Not that I know of.
8B08774F     //  He has a brother employed here. You know him?
8CD25251     //  We employ large numbers of Mexicans. I'm not familiar with them all.
EB958D55     //  You're not the type of boss who talks to his workers?
853A9221     //  I am, but a lot of them don't have much English.
B8B85F36     //  That's funny, Parnell. He has the same address as his brother Juan, who we shot dead less than an hour ago. You better give me something.
38927CF7     //  Look, I'm not involved in this. I'm getting enough grief from Washington. There's an investigation going on into profiteering. Like a guy shouldn't be able to turn a buck while the war is on.
5309006E     //  I'm sure thousands of dead Marines sleep soundly knowing that you did okay.
86BB2FBD     //  Tell us the truth, Parnell. You and Cruz are moving dope from Mexico and packaging it up here.
4AA7EA81     //  I am telling the truth. You don't have one scrap of evidence that says I'm behind this.
A6C5E5E6     //  I don't need any more federal intervention in my business. So stop making accusations and let's work out what's going on here.
0517625B     //  Tell us about Jorge Garcia Cruz.
2C2F36FB     //  Jorge? I had no idea of his last name. 
A6020272     //  His team does daily maintenance on the conveyor belts and cookers.
14FCDABB     //  So he's here now?
D94E04EA     //  No, maintenance is at night. Night shift finishes around midnight. He would usually come in around 9pm and have everything ready for the morning shift at six.
9E15B3CE     //  You're being made a patsy by a dope ring, Parnell, and you're happy to sit here and let it happen.
F0220A67     //  You want my help? I said I'd help. You want to call me names, you can go fuck yourself.
26231EF4     //  You know this fuck and his brother. They're extorting you and you need to tell the truth.
5E3B28B0     //  You're out of your mind if you think a couple of beaners could shake me down. Where is your proof?
BD47A996     //  Keep making outrageous accusations and you won't get any more help from me.
12B0F471     //  How are your sales, Mr Parnell?
C77CDEFF     //  Just fine and dandy, son. We're entering a new era of prosperity. I hope you're both big soup eaters.
9FCE1033     //  The dope leads here, Parnell. 
EAB337B8     //  Your new prosperity won't mean much when the papers hear that this place 
365BEDD8     //  is a cover-up for a dope operation.
9C324A10     //  Mr Parnell, do you know what kind of trouble you're in? Come clean with us.
9B71C72F     //  Okay, so things are a little flat. We're deciding whether to lower production. It's taken a while to adjust to not having any military contracts. You know we sold Uncle Sam five million cans of minestrone?
0B878F68     //  Son, that is a scandalous allegation. We fed the Army during the war on products canned here and we were proud to do so.
944B08C6     //  You're being economical with the truth, Parnell. You can't keep the business afloat so you've turned to dope.
6AD6C49A     //  Would you like to prove that I'm involved in this scam? I'm a legitimate business man.
C1525DAD     //  I want to get to the bottom of this just as much as you do. You should try being civil and working with me.
DB6D1009     //  The factory sealed cans we found suggest a very professional operation, Mr Parnell. We're looking for an inside man.
A4188D10     //  I know nothing about this! I want this stopped as much as you do.
008F1B71     //  You must suspect someone, Mr Parnell.
87960BB9     //  Are you sure it isn't someone who stole some of my labels? That would be pretty easy to do.
1ACD3406     //  Tell me what I want to know, Parnell, or I will have half the LAPD down here tearing this place apart. 
7B9E9375     //  You're hiding something.
232B44CF     //  Am I right in thinking you would not want to pursue misdemeanors outside your drug case?
71AE96D7     //  Depending on what you call a misdemeanor, we might be prepared to turn a blind eye.
9BEE7C4E     //  The truth is I employ a lot of illegals. No one wants to do menial work anymore. Most of my factory staff are wetbacks. The local blacks and chicanos all want jobs in aircraft factories.
36F70B30     //  Presumably because the pay is a lot better.
0EF3CA20     //  Quit lying, Parnell. How could the cans be coming off the line sealed without your knowledge? You're the kingpin here.
685FA368     //  You want to make an accusation like that, son, you'd better have some goddamn proof.
84DC948F     //  When I work out who's behind this I'm gonna throw them out on their ass, and then I'm gonna throw you out alongside them.
4EB49E9D     //  We'd like to take a look around the factory floor, Mr Parnell.
5D902C02     //  I hope we won't have to shut down the line?
634A03E4     //  No, nothing like that.
EC0B3C9B     //  Thank you. I'm grateful for that.
D0D95870     //  I'll show you around myself.
30A055E6     //  Show us to the factory floor.
FA15F625     //  Now, hold on a second. You expect to storm in here, throw around a bunch of accusations, and then get a guided tour?
A19B17E6     //  Bingo. Let's go, fat boy.
214A9C7E     //  I get off around six if you're interested, but there's really nothing more I can help you with now.
38BBE944     //  You seem like a nice boy, Detective. But if you have any more questions you really should direct them toward Mr Parnell.
4C78342D     //  This is where the produce comes in. We peel and sort all of the vegetables and add them to the line in regular quantities.
1C90AFBD     //  This is the hopper, which boils and purées the vegetables. The other hopper is for the pasta. This way, please.
E4D85A08     //  The soup is ladled automatically into cans. Next stage is labelling.
19935B13     //  I'd like to see the packing and dispatch area if you don't mind.
37DE3F86     //  Sure - it's over here. Follow me.
C973EE96     //  This is one of our dispatchers. Sergio, right?
5B7041CA     //  Yes, sir.
44D135E4     //  These men are from the LAPD.
41E21684     //  What were you expecting?
31571538     //  I'll have to come back at night to find out.
3A5420C7     //  Sergio here records our outgoing deliveries. They all go in the book. Just there, on the desk.
88EFCAEC     //  We're looking for repeat business in large amounts, Cole.
6D312F12     //  What's going on, Parnell? There's enough soup going to this place every day to feed a company of Marines.
C8E25565     //  What are you talking about?
9CF266F3     //  We're a proud company, Detective. If something's going on, I want it stopped.
5B86C224     //  We're a family company using family recipes. We don't know anything about dope rings. I need you to stop this from ruining the company's reputation.
E4B8AFD7     //  Detective, the pot is on the boil. How about getting on with things?
468809EB     //  Don't run off, Detective. I'm counting on you to straighten this out.
AD22D98C     //  I tried to help, but every word I say gets twisted. I'm going to talk to my lawyer, kid. You can work this one out on your own.
04F988F5     //  I'd like a private word with your dispatcher, if you don't mind?
74360436     //  Sure, go right ahead. I'll be over here when you need me.
4934AC11     //  Can I have a look at that coin?
DEAF6D65     //  Sure, why not?
7CB19B96     //  A silver dollar, right?
715B7D85     //  Yeah, that's right.
3B2FED53     //  The markings on it say it's been taken out of circulation.
A7319A59     //  Maybe. I'm not trying to buy anything with it. 
9DC3A440     //  I like it. Brings me luck.
BA8B4528     //  Thanks.
E5DC9104     //  What do you know about the 20th Century Market?
34A9502D     //  Nada. I get the orders from upstairs. I send the goods where I'm told.
F0A005E5     //  And you don't know Juan Garcia Cruz?
666E4493     //  No, not me.
9116BACD     //  We just want to talk to Juan, Sergio. You sure you couldn't tell us where we could find him?
62B2728B     //  Sorry. I never heard of the man.
90D25910     //  Juan Garcia Cruz is dead, lunkhead. His brother works here nights. What can you tell us, Sergio?
124852BA     //  I'm just the dispatcher. Juan was crazy. 
3B258B29     //  Puto loved guns.
4FF63531     //  You're a liar, Sergio. You're in it and I'm going to break you for it.
560E291A     //  You're loco, placa. I got nothing to do with Juan Garcia.
B43F11C3     //  We found a matching silver dollar on Juan Garcia. What are the odds of that, Sergio?
5B7260B3     //  Juan and Jorge aren't brothers. They're cousins. They work for some evil gabacho. The guy is an aberration. He gives out the silver dollars. Jorge gets me a list of deliveries every morning. 20th Century is always on there.
521272C1     //  You keep your mouth shut for today and I don't take you in. Do we have a deal?
FEB8058A     //  Do I have a choice?
61052C29     //  Is that a serious question?
E550994B     //  I already told you I don't know him. You should listen harder when people speak, mister.
23ADC310     //  Do you have access to the canning area?
51140980     //  I do, but I keep to my station, loading and unloading. Don't care much for soup.
457D72B0     //  Sergio, we know the dope gets canned here. We know it happens at night.
AE7DDD2B     //  And you know I work days and what goes on at night I don't want to know about.
BCE1B09C     //  Sergio, if you don't give me something I'm going to go to Immigration Services and have you deported.
EF9ABCAE     //  They get a shipment once every two weeks. Ernesto does the driving. I don't know his full name. Gets delivered here at night, Jorge gets it canned up. From here it gets sent all over the country.
EC9B91B0     //  Stop lying to me. I think you are muling the dope across the border.
985096C1     //  I'm a simple working guy caught up in the middle of all this. You're crazy if you think you can prove I drive the truck for these guys.
9317BED4     //  I want a deal. 
D8378875     //  I'll help you out if you promise to keep my name out of it. Otherwise you get nothing more from me.
F500FA53     //  That's it for now, Sergio. If we need to speak to you again, we'll put in a call to Mr Parnell.
0B614245     //  If you have to, I guess.
E64CD731     //  Sorry, mister, I can't hear a word you're saying.
BAA0F682     //  I don't think I can help you, mister.
4AEF5D3F     //  As long as Mr Parnell says we can stand around here doing nothing, then it's okay with me.
39777D56     //  If you've got something on your mind, mister, best you come back and say it.
D7A30621     //  You're pretty hard to please, placa. I think you should leave me alone now.
97AB638F     //  We will be in touch, Mr Parnell. 
0E1D436B     //  It is imperative that things appear as normal here. 
B6CDF8FA     //  Keep an eye on Sergio, in case he gets tempted to blow the whistle.
BA060CBD     //  Thanks, I'll do that. 
71AA183A     //  You're going to overlook my little immigration problem, aren't you?
314622AF     //  Cheer up, fatso. 
453E18E3     //  We're going to let you go on squeezing these poor saps a little while longer. 
3CA118EF     //  Well... until some Commie union types infiltrate this place.
AD1DCEA6     //  Second silver dollar today. I think I'll have Ray check out that angle.
0EEF9027     //  How many years have you been in Vice, Roy?
C9064B4F     //  More years than I want to own up to, Phelps.
0FD3C860     //  You have any idea who Rojas was talking about?
6BF78EA1     //  The gringo who runs the operation? Could be anybody. You don't expect those morons to be running the show, do you? If you asked Rojas how much a silver dollar is worth he'd probably say fifty cents.
9944ED85     //  Sit tight. Let's take a look at what's going on.
1EE71FA6     //  Car 11 King to KGPL.
18DB838C     //  Car 11 King, go ahead.
1BA3F381     //  I'm requesting assistance and a B-wagon at 20th Century Markets, 
3E52D503     //  1558 North Highland. Numerous narcotics suspects.
9398E7F7     //  Code Two only, no sirens.
1D6A3A7A     //  11K, roger.
27047A83     //  Okay. Cavalry should be here any minute.
5DD838D7     //  LAPD! Nobody move!
FC4F4971     //  I'll take my chances.
D7CE8C52     //  Come on, Cole. Hurry up and drop this joker.
20DDA0CD     //  Alright! Please - I give up!
939EF311     //  Whatever you're carrying, hand it over.

54F370AB     //  You can't take me in.
74692DA0     //  Take you in? Be glad he didn't shoot you. 
BD9591A2     //  I wouldn't have chased you. 
D876943B     //  If it was up to me you'd be talking out of a hole in the back of your head.
BCDAED6E     //  I want information.
7E6A7323     //  Señor, I would like to help you. 
8891D383     //  But I got a family in Mexico I have to provide for, and my compadres are very unreasonable.
D3C45C84     //  Your compadres? Turn out your pockets.
E7777924     //  I need Ray to run down these silver dollars.
5C4D09A9     //  I need to make a deal. I need guarantees.
20C0EF06     //  You have identification?
C60D6903     //  Sanchez, Airto. Mexican. Tijuana address.
E06AB074     //  Here's the deal, Airto. You give me information and I won't give you to Immigration.
267C1DF7     //  Tell me about the soup cans.
219261F6     //  The soup is very popular - as you can see.
28BB66FB     //  Airto, you can skate on this. We're not interested in a flunky running a farmer's market. We want the people running the operation.
3D58237C     //  You seem okay, but you can never trust a gringo who wants something.
C399D63B     //  Real funny, wise guy. You want to try saying that again with no teeth?
4AA75666     //  I get a delivery at 7.30 every other day from the factory. Jorge organizes everything.
5831BF50     //  I think you're the connection on the Mexican side. I think you're more than you like to make out.
B998742F     //  So now I'm the big man in this?
B9042D0D     //  I have big dreams. I want to make enough to bring my family over. Don't stand in my way, policeman.
3711C4D6     //  We know about Jorge and Juan. Juan is dead.
2C6F45F6     //  Tell us how you know the Cruz boys.
09543771     //  Ernesto put together this thing. He brought in Juan. Juan brought in Jorge.
FAA401C3     //  Continue.
5557D87B     //  I was already here. Ernesto knows I'm illegal, so he threatened to report me if I didn't help... and the money is good. The gringos and the gringas, they love the reefer. And I didn't want to have to leave and start again in San Francisco.
FE9FC1FE     //  You're breaking my heart.
D6989E5B     //  I don't give a fuck about your Mex buddies or their leader, Ernesto. Tell me about the white man with the silver dollars.
80AC0AE6     //  You're plum loco, jefito, if you think I'm going to talk about him. 
A25D2674     //  That man is cursed. I want nothing to do with him.
338A7DAC     //  I think you're related to the Cruz boys and that's how this thing got off the ground.
F2B6CCED     //  There is no way you can prove that, Officer. Do you have our birth certificates?
3EF4E5C4     //  Juan and Jorge are from Matamoros. Ernesto and I are from Tijuana but we aren't related.
BCFC42E3     //  Give me EJ, the driver bringing in the shipments, or I'll make you for it.
EDDA9B68     //  I run the shop. That's all I do.
E27E3230     //  Juan brings it in, Parnell's does the canning, and you sell it. Is that how it works?
A2697842     //  Something like that. I do what I'm told.
40974D93     //  Start talking, Airto. I want the names of everyone involved.
971B2939     //  What difference does it make what I tell you? I'm still going to jail, no?
D4428B7F     //  Tell me the goddamn truth. You are in this with the others.
18C0C56B     //  I told you I know them. I told you my family is at risk. What makes me part of their gang?
EEC49262     //  You have a silver dollar, Airto. Just like Juan. I'm sure Ernesto and the rest have them as well.
6D17A325     //  The silver dollars are his mark.
A65A9AAB     //  Whose? Give me a name.
3CC798F7     //  None of us are allowed to see him. His creatures carry his orders to us. If I gave you his name, I would be buried alongside my wife and children.
3872C4FE     //  If you don't give us something, you will rot in jail while your family starves on the street.
CA599C36     //  Ernesto Juarez... tonight at 1am. He is bringing the truck into the soup factory. Please help me, sir. Ernesto can be very cruel.
14D0F16A     //  I am not like them. They do not care if others suffer.
5D5DE49C     //  You're under arrest, Airto. I'll speak to the DA and see if he will agree to not seize your assets or deport you. That's the best I can do.
680E1A92     //  You're going to jail, Airto. Our jails may be nicer than what you could expect in Mexico, but I can tie you up in red tape for years.
DF9E3BDE     //  You've got this one chance to cooperate, Airto. Give me your delivery boys or you'll do every year that we were saving for them.
45D02B86     //  Alright! I... there's a shipment coming in tonight, to the soup factory. 
196690D6     //  Parnell's Soup Factory, 1am. Ernesto will be there.
9F870294     //  I did all of this for my family. You gringos have no idea of the poverty... the things you throw away could feed a family. I have nothing more to say to you.
E7772A94     //  My future is here in California. I don't want to talk to you anymore.
53E0A1E6     //  Please... may I go, Officer?
CD8A67E9     //  Don't go. I will give you all the help I can.
DFD96AD3     //  No. You cannot protect me. I have to keep my mouth shut.
5BEF34F4     //  We should get some backup and stake out the cannery tonight.
0637BD64     //  Look, they're moving wholesale amounts of this stinky shit. I say we go back to the factory tonight.
75D1D42B     //  Freddie said they were moving fifty pounds a week. That's a lot of soup cans.
D38A116A     //  I think this is an interstate operation moving dope around the country to selected grasshoppers. Local weed gets distributed in the usual way, through pachuco street punks.
205AD544     //  Someone must know something about this drug baron character...
E5D9FB4E     //  Here they come.
17DD7069     //  Let them unload the goods first.
10842C82     //  Now?
61B0BAC1     //  Let's get 'em.
CD9F3366     //  Whoa, Cole. Let the boys in blue take the heat, then we'll mop up. That's why we brought them, right?
3B4E825C     //  LAPD! Put your hands where we can see them!
8EDBAFF2     //  I saw someone trying to get out through the offices! Let's see if we can flush him out.
F612EFFD     //  All clear? I think that's the last of them, Cole.
AE198441     //  Detectives? Found something here you'll probably want to see.
75EA80BD     //  Tijuana address. We should see what the Federales have on him.
428B9ED8     //  One dollar per dead man. Doesn't seem like much for a human life.
0BD05BCB     //  Goddamn. I think we've found our stash, Cole. 
3C81C02A     //  Take a look in these boxes.
8C929494     //  At the very minimum, another fifty pounds.
F7796FAB     //  Detectives. I think we got the guy. Does the name Cruz mean something to you?
5E133392     //  Must be a thousand dollars here.
149DF4FA     //  Yet another silver dollar.
B244BA04     //  Phelps. Earle. Looks like quite a bloodbath. What was this all about?
A9BA6569     //  Drugs and money. What else? Speaking of money... where did that roll go?
BEC8462D     //  I picked it up for safekeeping. The department owes me fifty.
2CF5A8AA     //  Ray - I have another two coins for you.
858F9677     //  Great. I've got something to show you. It's all set up on the table over here.
5AD28314     //  There... take a look at these coins you've been collecting.
B2E9A36E     //  There are letters cut into each coin, along with 'not legal tender'. What does it mean?
5F705654     //  Those are Morgan silver dollars from the twenties. 
CEFDEC00     //  They were removed from circulation and sent for disposal. 
395B51C4     //  A number of smelters around the country had the contract. 
34CCD3CB     //  Look at them together. 
D7B32EB1     //  Can you work out what it says?
226674A3     //  The first coin, 'MAS'. The second, 'ANG'. 
E9C3BF56     //  The third, 'KAY'. The fourth, 'MET'. The fifth, 'ALS'. 
82D2B4BA     //  Masangkay Metals.
D473FE23     //  A metal foundry. Would you like the address?
E0BC380A     //  Would I ever.
41C0FFB3     //  1034 Vine St, Hollywood. We'll finish up here. 
BD9CA844     //  It's already been a long night, Phelps. 
22DC42EB     //  See if you can talk them into giving themselves up.
1F472AF5     //  Phelps, you have an address. Get on with the case.
62B49413     //  Let me check out the bodies. I'll call if one contains something more interesting than bullets. You need to find the foundry.
A9A7E44E     //  You want me to clean this mess up, Phelps, you'd best get back here and explain.
BB941441     //  Quite a coin collection you've gathered, Phelps. Let me look after the evidence. You get on with the case.
14797587     //  You've done the detecting. Now go out and arrest the bad guys.
DB1B3184     //  Phelps, wait. Trust me, you want to hear all of this.
E48D4956     //  Locked. We need another way in.
4347C640     //  If these guys are anything like the Cruz boys there's going to be plenty of lead flying. Take it careful and slow.
D51AF3A0     //  Cover the back door, Roy.

E8C314DE     //  What can I say? I got lucky.
77702260     //  Bullshit. You're cheating and I'm going to catch you at it before the night is out. Now deal.
71244ACD     //  I'll take three.
0EFD7FF4     //  None for me.

D22A2015     //  Need a hand here, Cole! I'm outnumbered!
AA3D86F0     //  Phelps! Get over here! I got this son of a bitch holed up!

541433ED     //  The distinctive twin Gothic towers of the Hall of Records rise above a domed skylight some fifty feet across. The glasswork depicts a mountain cave overgrown with plants and wildflowers, and a waterfall chandelier hangs downward over the lobby.
9AB157F8     //  Crossroads of the World
B33C08D4     //  Ella Crawford, widow of murdered underworld boss Charlie Crawford, funded the construction of this lavish outdoor shopping mall in 1936. It is designed to look like an ocean liner, and the 30 foot tower is topped with a revolving world globe.

F8EB1E68     //  The Hollywood Roosevelt was built in 1927 at a cost of $2.5 million. Its 'Blossom Room' hosted the first ever Academy Awards ceremony on May 19, 1929, where 'Wings', a silent film about fighter pilots in WW1, won the inaugural award for Best Picture.
22331AEB     //  LA Cold Storage Co.
96E3E3B9     //  The Los Angeles Cold Storage Company built its first ice production plant in 1895. Feeding the growing city meant keeping produce fresh, and the six story 4th Street warehouse was constructed, with more than a million cubic feet of freezer space.
68A1B640     //  LA County Art Museum
2E14F22D     //  This site hosted racing and gambling until 1909, when concerned citizens had it recreated as a 'cultural center'. The museum kept fine art, while the rose garden hid wonders such as a sphere-within-a-sphere celestial model, or 'armillary sphere'.
1A6E15F9     //  LA Public Library

D2DB8B7F     //  That's the guy from the papers. Solved that big case.

6B414585     //  Isn't he the cop they been talking about on the radio? Won another commendation?
813069D1     //  Isn't that the cop who solved the big case and got promoted?
81EA6BEB     //  That's the guy . I heard he's an honest cop. Now there's an oxymoron for you.
FB8F7C93     //  Isn't that the cop who caught the guy who was pretending to be dead?
CBBC6B52     //  The kid who died in the street car race. I think that's the cop. Lucky he wasn't killed.
68CA002A     //  Did you read about the woman who stabbed her husband then pushed him in front of the car? That's the cop who caught her.
8EC60B8C     //  That's Phelps. You must have read about him. Shot it out with those hoodlums from the stolen car ring.
60B7550A     //  He's the cop who arrested that movie producer. Its about time some of those movie people went to jail. They think they're untouchable.
C0EC8E28     //  See him? I saw his picture in the paper. He worked that case with the lady cut up like the Dahlia.
BD6339F9     //  That's the one. About a week ago this guy murdered his wife and dumped her, but that's the cop who put him away.
5052037F     //  I think his name is Phelps. He brought in the case of that poor lady killed near City Hall.
B0BCFE34     //  Did you read about the TARALDSEN case in the paper? That's the detective who solved it. Those poor kids, losing everything like that.
DB5D8822     //  Remember the dead lady they found under the train? He solved the case. Booked some barfly for the murder.
96AB532D     //  Here's what I heard: that cop caught the guy who did the Dahlia, but they covered it all up. Some kind of big conspiracy.
5E4B6486     //  I know that face. That's the guy who busted all those negro drug pushers last week, isn't it?
88AE40F1     //  I'm telling you, if there were more cops like him around, I wouldn't be so worried about my children getting hooked on the reefer.
B6D56C79     //  You watch the Hammond-Galahad fight? Some mess that was. Anyway, that's the cop who caught the guy.
A8E7B76D     //  I heard about that cop! He's the one who chased that big monkey up the hotel tower! Wow!
6956F499     //  Remember Mickey and his boys were shooting up the whole town last week? I heard that cop there was the only one fighting back. He's either brave or crazy.
6B283D0B     //  There. Phelps, that's him. Well, he can solve all the cases he wants, he's still a lowdown dog for what he did to his wife.
123BD04B     //  They didn't put it in the paper, but I heard that's the cop working those fires at the housing lots. They say he's getting somewhere with them, too.
88BCC63F     //  A dozen city blocks go up in smoke, and it all comes down to one cop to solve it. You ask me, Detective Cole Phelps just got lucky.
BBBA9B8C     //  That's the creep. Walked out on his wife.
AD23BF97     //  Phelps, that's him. Bent cop. He's on the front page of the Times.
1C6C0435     //  You sure that's not that crazy cop who almost ran me over?
906A0334     //  That son of a bitch looks a lot like the cop who pointed his gun at me.
F3F99A00     //  That's him, that's the cop. Tried to poke me in the nose.
84C80ADA     //  I was walking down the street and that heel sent me flying.
53A19D67     //  That's the swine. Look at him.
BA47F52B     //  He's the dirty cop from the newspapers.
F1E4F1C0     //  Uh... you got a problem, pal?
516B91EA     //  This guy's got a screw loose.
E9BDE8BE     //  Buddy? You drop something?
3F0BA13F     //  Who's he hiding from?
92834C21     //  I think someone's had a few too many.
CEFA951E     //  Will you look at this clown?
4254D079     //  There gonna be an air-raid or something?
