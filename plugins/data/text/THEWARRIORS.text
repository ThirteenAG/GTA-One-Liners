BD40BAD5    //   Man, he's gotta lay off that shit.
6C8D265A    //   Man, the Huns got this marketplace sewn up tight.  Cleon says that anything that comes in or out gets marked down in the ledger.
40F95C04    //   Man, why'd you have to fuck up there?  We needed it, man!
AF037362    //   Man, you an' the boys laid a nice beatin' on those Warrior chumps Birdie.

9B29320B    //   Maybe we ought a talk about this later huh?
E31F1D96    //   Maybe we oughta pull a train on you.  You look like you might even like it.
D44ABD0D    //   Maybe we oughta worry about who set that goddamn fire.
24089CC8    //   Maybe we should get up to Tony's and check it out?
00FB2BD2    //   Maybe we should split up!
7CC917C0    //   Maybe we'll get to waste a few heads along the way.

D80C2E85    //   Nice work Warriors, but we gotta stay sharp, this here's gonna be a real rough one...
B2E8654D    //   No chance.
9D70AC08    //   No more than 9 delegates may attend from any given gang, and on this day I want no action.
D0994200    //   No problem Warlord.  I'll take the Warriors all city.  There won't be anybody in New York who doesn't know this gang.
38B3746D    //   No reason.  I just like doin' things like that.
DD459E0A    //   No soldier will carry a shank, a bat, a brick, a stick or a gun.
93AD934A    //   No sweat.  They're looking for the Warriors remember?  We can do some looking ourselves.  Ought to make you feel better.
DAD202C6    //   No wonder Virgil didn't show!  It was a setup!
10D4446F    //   No, no , no... we won't be takin' the heat.  Yeah.

07E34C1C    //   No.  Nooo.  It wasn't us.  It was them, the Warriors.
B4CEAC8D    //   No.  There will be no retribution.  Unity and peace, is what matters.  What is the name of this outfit?
81E6D4B1    //   No.  Watch yourselves though, I don't need you gettin' wrecked up there.
4F5E0A23    //   No. We taught the Huns a few things though, right brother?
7FFD95AC    //   Nobody is wasting nobody.  That is a miracle.  And miracles is the way things ought to be.
85454785    //   None of you make your home in El Barrio.

E3AC063D    //   Nothin' yet, he's around though.  Keep lookin', but be careful, he's got a knife.
5819F238    //   Nothing officer.  Just heard that the Jones Street Boys had some kind of heavy setup.  Sellin' shit real cheap outta their digs.
F3BE6850    //   Nothing would move without us allowing it to happen.
2C691608    //   Now Cyrus don't want anybody packed, and he don't want anybody flexing any muscle.  So I gave him my word that the Warriors would uphold the truce.
F24823A2    //   Now everybody says that Cyrus is the one and only.  I think we'd better go and have a look for ourself.

0A2B5CF3    //   Right now, we're gonna need some cash to get you fixed up.  The way a Warrior makes his bread is by mugging, stealing car radios and doin' smash an' grabs.

6D784AA2    //   Shit!  The Warriors!  They can't hold me down, you know?  Try to grab a Hurricane, it's like air, man, like air.  Hurricanes para siempre!  Show me another set that rules like us, eh?
710D5335    //   Shit!  The pigs got Fox pinned down!
86DCDAFA    //   Shit!  This train's had it!

E471BD85    //   Solid.
DFA80610    //   Some of our soldiers got japped.  They put up a good fight though.  Those Warriors are gettin' pretty heavy Virgil!
726AB1D2    //   Some two-bit outfit almost got them, but they bopped their way past.  We can make them at the 96th St. Station.  The platform's probably crawling with cops.
5C292714    //   Son of a bitch.
E2349712    //   Soon's I get back....
D4F26B8B    //   Sorry Warriors, looks like you're about to be blown away!
3EC76664    //   Sorry, b-b-but the celebration has b-b-been cut short.

ED0E3536    //   That dickhead thinks more about that junkheap than he does about me and I don't like it.
BD9C0A92    //   That fucker ain't gettin' away from us.  Snow, you take Rembrandt and go that way.  Cochise, you're with me.  If we don't see each other, meet up at the subway!
D3263453    //   That fucker got wasted.  I'm gonna tear their fucking hearts out one-by-one.

32425FA5    //   That's great, Rembrandt!  Really great!  Man, they're gonna be so pissed!
3AED3BDA    //   That's it.  The contest is finished.  The best writer showed he ain't no toy and he do not mess around.  All the way from Coney Island...
2D9D206C    //   That's right Warrior.  We heard you guys were good, that's why we called you in to help us take down Jones Street.
9F8330C0    //   That's the dude we want; the accountant.
89E78EB3    //   That's the only way we gonna come up in this city.
1D736CD4    //   That's the plan little man.
BAF65AD5    //   That's what I like to see, Rembrandt.
