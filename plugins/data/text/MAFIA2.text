00_01_00_0010     //  My name is Vito Scaletta.
00_01_00_0020     //  I was born in Sicily in 1925.
00_01_00_0030     //  That little guy's me. I'm standing there with my parents and my sister Francesca in front of our old house.
00_01_00_0040     //  I don't really remember too much about the old country... except that we were pretty hard up. And then one day, my father decided it was time to move away.
00_01_00_0050     //  Away from Sicily.  Across the ocean to start a new life in America.
00_01_00_0060     //  Never in my life had I seen anything as fantastic as Empire Bay. It was beautiful.
00_01_00_0070     //  On the other hand, I'd never seen anything filthier or more disgusting than our new shithole of an apartment.
00_01_00_0071     //  "The American Dream."
00_01_00_0072     //  It was more like a nightmare.
00_01_00_0080     //  We went from a poor village in Sicily to a dirty, overcrowded ghetto in America.
00_01_00_0090     //  My father started working at the port for the guy who arranged our emigration.
00_01_00_0100     //  It was back-breaking work, and what little money he made mostly went towards booze.
00_01_00_0110     //  Eventually my parents sent me to school.  I had to learn English, and I sure as hell wasn't gonna do that in a neighborhood full of Italians.
00_01_00_0120     //  That's where I met Joe...
00_01_00_0130     //  Over time, Joe and I got to be best friends.  And since we were both poor, and there were wasn't much work around, we started a little business of our own...
00_01_00_0140     //  C'mon, Vito. Hurry it up. We ain't got all night.
00_01_00_0150     //  I was the brains and Joe was the brawn.  We got into all kinds of trouble together.
00_01_00_0160     //  Shit. Vito! Run!
00_01_00_0170     //  Vito! This way!
00_01_00_0171     //  Freeze! Police!
00_01_00_0172     //  Stop!
00_01_00_0180     //  Throw me the bag!
00_01_00_0190     //  Stop or I'll shoot!
00_01_00_0200     //  Shit.
00_01_00_0210     //  OK, ye bastard, spread yer legs and put your hands on the fence!
00_01_00_0220     //  Fuck, I'm sorry, Vito.
00_01_00_0230     //  Well, that one time it didn't work out so good.  The year was 1943.  America was at war and the Army was lookin' for guys who spoke the language to help with the invasion of Sicily.
00_01_00_0231     //  I was eighteen, and anything seemed better than jail.  Who says you can't go home again?
00_01_00_0300     //  Shit.
00_01_00_0500     //  You pull this off, I won't forget it, trust me.
00_01_00_0510     //  Not too many guys got the stomach for this line of work.
00_01_00_0520     //  We need guys like you.
00_01_00_0530     //  Our new friend, Vito Scaletta.
00_01_00_0540     //  Where'd you get all this money, Vito?
00_01_00_0550     //  Started a fucking war.
00_01_00_0560     //  About time you showed up.
00_01_00_0570     //  These guys ain't cops!

00_62_03_0001     //  Vito Scaletta came to America from Sicily as a child, learning about poverty first-hand in Empire Bay's Italian ghetto. He watched his father work himself into an early grave and soon decided that life inside the law wasn't for him. Growing up on the streets, Vito crossed paths with Joe Barbaro, a loudmouthed bully who eventually became his best friend. Vito and Joe were the brains and the brawn behind a hundred petty crimes, all the while watching the neighborhood's wealthy gangsters and dreaming of the good life. Now an adult, Vito is determined to make something of himself at all costs.
00_62_03_0002     //  Joe Barbaro is a career criminal and lifelong friend of Vito Scaletta. Brash and unpredictable,  Joe can seemingly make trouble out of nothing. As a child, Joe was the neighborhood bully. He met Vito when the younger boy offered to fight him for a place in his gang. Over the next 10 years, the two of them made a great team, rational Vito keeping wild Joe in check as they enjoyed a life of petty crime. These days, Joe lives large - strong booze, fast cars, and loose women. Moving up the criminal ladder is the perfect way for him to feed his vices.
00_62_03_0003     //  The son of a Sicilian mobster, Henry Tomasino was sent to America in 1931 by his father to escape Mussolini's crackdown on the Sicilian mafia. Upon arriving in Empire Bay, Henry came under the protection of family friend and ruthless mob boss Alberto Clemente. Now a full member of the Clemente family, he is regarded as a loyal soldier and respected hitman. Henry is reserved and has few friends. His sole motivation is pride.
00_62_03_0004     //  Vito's mother, Maria Scaletta, has seen tough times. She came to America with her husband, Antonio, and their two children seeking a better life. Instead, America brought little but poverty and hardship. She watched as her husband's will was broken through years of toil and alcoholism, and as her son turned to a life of petty crime. Devoutly religious, Maria has faith that God will save her family and steer Vito to an honest life. Now a widow after Antonio's death, Maria still lives in the small family apartment with her daughter, Francesca.
00_62_03_0005     //  Antonio Scaletta married his wife, Maria, in the tiny Sicilian village of San Martino in 1920. Their daughter, Francesca, arrived one year later, soon followed by Vito. In 1932, Antonio and his family made the long journey to America. Arriving in Empire Bay nearly penniless and unable to speak English, Antonio accepted work and housing from union boss Derek Pappalardo. Trapped in a vicious cycle of backbreaking labor and extortionate rent, Antonio grew distant from his family as he turned to drinking, his dreams shattered. He drowned at the Southport docks in 1943 after falling into the water, apparently drunk.
00_62_03_0006     //  Francesca Scaletta is Vito's older sister.  A shy and quiet girl, she graduated from high school with honors and has run the church youth club since she was sixteen. Francesca tried to steer Vito away from the local street gangs when they were young, rewarding him with candy for doing chores and attending church. Now that they're older, all she can do is pray. Francesca, or "Frankie" as Vito calls her, lives at home with her mother, supporting them both with her bookkeeping job at the Trago Oil Co.
00_62_03_0007     //  Eric Reilly was born in Empire Bay to Irish immigrant parents in 1918. He grew up in Millville, working with his father servicing trucks for Trago Oil. Eric married Sara Collins, the daughter of the Trago motor pool boss, in 1936. After the wedding, Eric was rarely at home, stumbling in late at night after drinking with his delinquent friends and often verbally and physically abusing his wife. She left him after two miserable years. Eric lost his job soon after, and now earns money working occasional bar shifts and dealing marijuana.
00_62_03_0008     //  Martin Santorelli was born in Empire Bay in 1933. His dad worked as a projectionist in the huge theater in Midtown, so Marty watched a lot of movies as a kid, especially gangster films. Marty dreamed of life in the mob, and in his teens took to hanging around Freddy's Bar, just like his childhood neighbor and role model, Joe Barbaro. He now runs errands for Joe - delivering messages, collecting his winning bets, and waxing his car. He nags Joe to let him come along on some of his jobs, but Joe sees Marty as a kid brother and too naive to get involved in serious business.

00_62_05_0001     //  One of the most dangerous men in Empire Bay, Eddie Scarpa is a jovial sociopath. Once a Moretti family hitman, Eddie now runs many of Carlo Falcone's rackets out of the Maltese Falcon restaurant. Born in 1908 in Tamborra, Eddie fell in with organized crime at an early age. He and Carlo met while smuggling liquor into Empire Bay during Prohibition. When Carlo became the head of the Moretti (now Falcone) criminal family, he wanted to reward Eddie so he appointed him the owner of the Cathouse. The two are still close friends, although Carlo secretly views Eddie as a liability due to a poorly concealed drinking problem.
00_62_05_0002     //  Luca Gurino is a capo in the Clemente family, a position to which he rose after entombing his predecessor in the foundation of the Culver Dam. Always meticulously presented, Luca tries to mask his crude nature with an air of sophistication, though his ignorance always shows through. He was involved in Clemente's bootlegging operation during Prohibition, and afterwards attended to some of the family's more grim tasks at the Clemente slaughterhouse, where his ruthless nature drove him up the ranks.
00_62_05_0003     //  Federico "Fat Derek" Pappalardo is a Vinci family capo and head of the local chapter of the longshoreman's union. He started working the docks as a strikebreaker in 1916. It was his involvement in dockyard smuggling that led to his introduction to the Vinci crime family. After spending two years in prison for embezzlement, he played a prominent role in Empire Bay's Vinci-Moretti war in the early 1930s, after which he was rewarded with his current position. He then married Frank Vinci's goddaughter, bringing him further prestige. Derek is vulgar, violent, and greedy - perfect attributes for his job.
00_62_05_0004     //  Carlo Falcone arrived in America in 1913 and quickly fell in with the Moretti family. He ran their bootlegging operation during Prohibition, working with Eddie Scarpa to run alcohol from Canada. Carlo secretly conspired with Frank Vinci to assassinate Tomaso Moretti in 1933, bringing the Vinci-Moretti war to an end and taking control of the Moretti family himself. An apt strategist and modernizer, Carlo has no time for Sicilian mafia traditions. He recognizes that the mob got rich through Prohibition, and that they need a similar revenue stream to stay at peace.
00_62_05_0005     //  Alberto Clemente is head of the Clemente crime family. After killing a Palermo police captain for his uncle Silvio in 1920, he fled to Empire Bay. There, through his uncle's underworld contacts, he eventually made big money smuggling liquor during Prohibition. He was approved by the Commission to start his own family in 1929. Though powerful, Clemente's gang is still seen as second-rate by the other families. This is mostly due to Clemente's crooked business practices, even by mob standards.
00_62_05_0006     //  Frank Vinci is the long-standing boss of the Vinci family. Arriving in Empire Bay in 1908 with close friend Leo Galante, Vinci quickly set up extortion rackets in the Italian immigrant community. His gang ruled the city for the next decade. Frank operates discreetly, having close ties to politicians and police. When Prohibition cash dried up in the early 30s, tension between the Vinci and Moretti families erupted into a full-scale war. This conflict cost Vinci his underworld primacy, but he remains a powerful advocate of traditional mafia values, especially when it comes to drugs.
00_62_05_0007     //  Leo Galante is consigliere to Frank Vinci, and the mastermind behind the most successful criminal organization in Empire Bay's history. Upon arrival in 1908, the pair set up the Vinci family; Leo strategized and Frank provided the muscle. The pair took control of the Southport docks in the early 1920s, which made for easy smuggling of alcohol during Prohibition. Leo's passion lies in sports, especially boxing and horse racing. For 20 years, Leo ran the city's biggest bookmaking operation. He was arrested for fixing fights in 1943 and sentenced to five years in jail.
00_62_05_0008     //  Stephen Coyne is an enforcer for the Vinci family. Steve grew up in rural Birkland, moving to the city at the age of sixteen. While being arrested for battery, Steve badly beat an EBPD officer and was sentenced to ten years, of which he served five. It was in prison that he started working as muscle for fellow inmate Derek Pappalardo, a relationship that continues on the outside. Steve can never be a full member due to his Dutch-Irish heritage, but became the family's most trusted associate after he assassinated rival boss Tomaso Morretti to end the Empire Bay mob war.
00_62_05_0009     //  Dipton and Kingston are two of the oldest districts in Empire Bay, and the O'Neill gang that rules these areas has a long history. Brian O'Neill is the grandson of Jimmy O'Neill, head of Empire Bay's once-powerful Irish mob. The O'Neill clan first settled in the city in the early 1800s. Brian has his own ragtag gang of flunkeys, and employs them in rash and violent criminal acts. Smash-and-grabs, burglaries, muggings, and hold-ups are Brian's specialities - anything where his brute force and limited intellect can earn him the cash for a night out and the company of the city's many prostitutes.
00_62_05_0010     //  Mr. Wong holds the rank of Enforcer in Empire Bay's Triad criminal organizataion. He operates out of the Red Dragon restaurant in Chinatown. The young Zhe Yun Wong came to America as forced labor on a ship smuggling opium. He escaped when they made port at Cape Peak, and headed east to Empire Bay. Penniless and unable to speak English, he fell into servitude to the Triads. He moved up the ranks slowly, guarding opium dens and eventually masterminding their smuggling operation. He killed his cousin for stealing a shipment of opium, proving his loyalty and thus earning his current position.
00_62_05_0011     //  Antonio “Tony Balls” Balsamo is an aging mafia soldier in the Falcone crime family. Tony has worked for the Falcone family for over twenty years. He was once Tomaso Moretti's personal driver, and was badly injured when a car bomb killed Moretti in 1933. Since then, he has spent most of his time working the Falcone family's protection rackets. His most recent assignment is to protect the family's accountant, Harvey “Beans” Epstein, and the secrets he holds.
00_62_05_0012     //  Street punks known as Greasers first appeared across America in the early 1950s, named after their slicked-back hairstyles. Greaser interests include motorcycles, hot rods, and rock and roll. Rebellious troublemakers, greasers are the dirtier side of the rock and roll generation - barely organized, tough delinquents with attitude. Greasers in Empire Bay are led by ex-U.S. Army tank engineer Billy "Bones" Barnes, and hang around the garages and vacant lots of Millville, racing their cars, drinking alcohol, and partying.

00_62_07_0001     //  Mike Bruski runs the junkyard in Riverside. Ostensibly a mechanic, Mike is a career criminal, having served two brief prison terms in his early twenties for involvement in Lost Heaven bank heists. After his second stretch, Mike moved to Empire Bay and used his stashed earnings to open a junkyard. Mike runs various scams - trading in stolen auto parts, fencing stolen goods, and allowing the mob to use his junkyard to dispose of incriminating evidence.
00_62_07_0002     //  Carlos "Charlie" Lopez owns a series of body shops in Empire Bay. Born in Cuba, he came to America in 1922, barely speaking English and hoping to find work. He drifted between farms in the southern states, eventually learing to repair agricultural vehicles. By 1930, Charlie had saved enough money to move to Empire bay and open his own garage. He expanded throughout the Great Depression by "legalizing" stolen cars, many of which were sold abroad by Vinci capo Derek Pappalardo. Despite making an honest living from his body shop chain, Charlie continues to provides these services to the mob.
00_62_07_0003     //  Nathaniel Harold "Harry" Marsden III is a gun nut who sells black market miltary ordnance out of his basement shop in Kingston. He served six years in the U.S. Army and fought in France in WWII. It was in Normandy, during a nighttime visit to a whore house, that Harry earned a discharge when he poked out his left eye on a branch while climbing over a fence. Upon returning to Empire Bay, Harry worked with some Army contacts to get his hands on surplus ordnance. In between studying military history and drinking with fellow war vets, he supplies weapons to various organized crime elements in the city.
00_62_07_0004     //  Bruno Levine is a mob-backed loan shark based out of a small office in Southport. He sits at the top of a network of loan sharks in Empire Bay, and is officially sanctioned by the Commission. He lends mob money to small-time sharks, crooks, and businessmen, charging extortionate rates of interest and backed up by mob muscle. He is fair in so far as he treats all debtors equally. He will honor his side of any bargain to the letter, but expects the same in return. Numerous stories exist of those who have failed to pay Bruno back on time.
00_62_07_0005     //  Andreas "El Greco" Karafantis is an expatriate Greek doctor.  He provides discreet medical services to Empire Bay's mafia families. El Greco studied medicine in London, and originally served as a doctor in the Greek Embassy. He was transferred in 1927 to the office of the U.S. Ambassador in Empire Bay. El Greco was dismissed from the embassy three years later after a dalliance with the Ambassador's wife, and went into private practice. After being handsomely rewarded for saving the lives of a number of gangsters during Empire Bay's Vinci-Moretti war, he began offering his services to the underworld.
00_62_07_0006     //  Giuseppe Palminteri was regarded as Italy's most talented forger and safe cracker, renowned by the underworld and police alike. He often worked directly for the Sicilian mafia, including when he helped to break thirteen notorious gangsters (including Alberto Clemente's uncle Silvio) out of a Palermo jail in 1917. When Mussolini rose to power, Giuseppe relocated to Empire Bay, where he once again began providing illicit services to the city's mob families. Now retired, Giuseppe is a friendly old man with no known family, who lives only for his craft.
00_62_07_0007     //  Freddy Macchione is the bartender and proprietor of Freddy's in Little Italy. Freddy's was a speakeasy during Prohibition, funneling alcohol smuggled by Alberto Clemente to thirsty customers, and enjoying protection from Clemente's gang. After Prohibition, Clemente capitalized on Freddy's gambling debts to buy into the bar, funded a refit, and re-opened it as a bar and restaurant. Freddy's now plays host to the day-to-day operations of the Clemente family, in addition to laundering money from Clemente's protection rackets.
00_62_07_0008     //  Jack Olivero is the bartender at the Maltese Falcon, one of the classier restaurants in Empire Bay and the base of the Falcone family's operations. Jack worked for Eddie Scarpa during Prohibition, running alcohol out of Tamborra. When Jack was arrested for smuggling in 1928, he refused to cooperate with authorities and did his time. He was rewarded with his current job by Eddie and Carlo upon his release. These days, Jack is happy to work the bar at the Falcon and turn a blind eye to the daily traffic of mobsters, money, and contraband.
00_62_07_0009     //  Sidney Pen, or “The Fat Man“ as he is widely known in the Empire Bay underworld, is a crooked businessman and former associate of Alberto Clemente. Clemente bought a stake in Pen's Empire Bay Cab Co. in the late 1920s and began laundering his bootlegging profits through the company. The two fell out when Pen opened a distillery in Sand Island in 1939 and refused to give Clemente a piece of the action, assuming the evidence he had against him would keep him safe. After his men killed two would-be hitmen sent by Clemente, Pen stepped up his personal security.

00_72_00_0009     //  The British used prison ships in Empire Bay to hold thousands of American POWs during  the Revolutionary War. The conditions were so terrible that more men died here of disease than in the battles of the war itself.
00_72_00_0010     //  The landscaping of Lincoln Park began in 1867. Named to commemorate the death of the popular president, the large green space was designated by public-minded city planners to preserve a pleasant area in the rapidly expanding metropolis.
00_72_00_0011     //  Empire Bay Diner's famous Bay Decker sandwich is now served in an estimated 50,000 hotels and restaurants across the world. Its inventor, Ernie Sands, first created the sandwich using leftovers from a buffet lunch celebrating the end of the first World War in 1918.
00_72_00_0012     //  Irish fabric manufacturer John Dipton opened the first Dipton Apparel clothing shop in Kingston around 1850.  Since then, the business gained a reputation for great quality and value, with stores found in every major US city.
00_72_00_0013     //  The Empire Arms hotel in Southport was famous for hosting glamorous balls attended by movie stars, business moguls, and politicians. It burned to the ground in 1942, and is now being rebuilt as a million-dollar development that will stun the world.
00_72_00_0014     //  The iconic Grand Upper Bridge spans the Culver River, linking the districts of Uptown and Hunters. When completed in 1894, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world and remained so for the next ten years.
00_72_00_0015     //  The hills behind Empire Bay are dominated by the fantastic Culver Dam. When completed in 1933, it was the world's largest hydroelectric power plant, and still provides electricity to over 20,000 homes in the Bay State area.

00_72_00_0019     //  Empire Bay's Chinatown is the largest concentration of Chinese people in the Western hemisphere. The first Chinese to arrive were traders and sailors in the mid 1700s, but the population explosion mainly occurred in the twentieth century when garment, laundry, and restaurant trades attracted thousands to emigrate from the Chinese mainland.
00_72_00_0020     //  The Bombers gang runs the streets in the slum districts of Sand Island and Hunters in the southwest of the city.

00_72_01_0001     //  
00_72_01_0002     //  Omerta is the code of silence that members of the mafia swear to uphold when joining the organization. Those who break Omerta by giving information to the authorities are given a death sentence by the mafia's ruling body.
00_72_01_0003     //  The word "mafia" roughly translated from Sicilian means "swagger" or "boldness". It is a term given to the organization by the press, with mafiosos having many different ways of referring to their gang structure and hierarchy.
00_72_01_0004     //  The boss of the Vinci family is Frank Vinci. Frank is a firm traditionalist with interests in construction and gambling. Vinci also controls the Southport dockworkers union, using his influence to bleed money from the merchant vessels that use his workforce. Controlling the port also helps him smuggle black market goods into the city.
00_72_01_0005     //  Carlo Falcone heads the Falcone crime family. Carlo is a ruthless modernizer who sees the American Mafia as needing to break from its Sicilian traditions. Carlo and his underboss Eddie Scarpa are two of the most dangerous men in Empire Bay.
00_72_01_0006     //  The Clemente family is led by Alberto Clemente. Clemente runs Freddy's Bar in Little Italy, a slaughterhouse in Riverside, and various small rackets around the city. Clemente is cheap and underhanded; his organization is viewed as second-rate by the other families.
00_72_01_0007     //  A consigliere is an advisor to the boss. This role is granted to an especially trusted confidante who can mediate disputes with other families, offer advice, and administer the legitimate side of the business.
00_72_01_0008     //  A man must be able to claim Sicilian or Italian descent to become a member of the American Mafia. Non-Italians are often associated with the mafia, but can never join the organization itself.
00_72_01_0009     //  When a man becomes a full member or "made man," he cannot be murdered by other members without prior approval from the boss of his family.
00_72_01_0010     //  A "pentito" is a term used for a mafioso who turns informant. In the late 1930s, Tommy Angelo famously informed on the Salieri family in Lost Heaven, and in doing so revealed the inner workings of the mafia to both law enforcement agencies and the American public.
00_72_01_0011     //  The Mona Lisa bar on the city's west side is owned by mob boss Frank Vinci and is used to launder money from his other less legitimate businesses. Frank named the bar for his late wife.
00_72_01_0012     //  The Falcone crime family operates out of the Maltese Falcon restaurant. It got its name due to  Carlo Falcone's love of detective novels. Falcone underboss Eddie Scarpa runs the day-to-day business of the restaurant, spending most of his time at the bar.
00_72_01_0013     //  The Commission is the ruling body of the American Mafia. Comprised of the heads of major families, the Commission oversees mafia activities in an attempt to avoid inter-family wars.
00_72_01_0014     //  The American Mafia amassed huge fortunes bootlegging alcohol during Prohibition. Since the ban on alcohol was lifted in 1933, profits have dried up and the tensions between mafia families have been rising.
00_72_01_0015     //  Organized crime in Empire Bay is dominated by three families - the Vinci, Falcone, and Clemente gangs.
00_72_01_0016     //  Luca Gurino is Alberto Clemente's capo. He operates out of Freddy's Bar in Little Italy. Luca is a vicious sadist and is notorious amongst Empire Bay's prostitutes for his violent behavior.
00_72_01_0017     //  Frank Vinci and his close associate Leo Galante first arrived in Empire Bay from Sicily in 1908. Together they set up the most successful criminal organization in the city's history with Frank providing the muscle and Leo the brains.

00_72_02_0001     //  Tommy Angelo's testimony, trial of Ennio Salieri, 1938
00_72_02_0002     //  I became a criminal because I did not want to become a victim.
00_72_02_0003     //  Lost Heaven is rotten to its core. Even the police and politicians are in hock to Mr. Salieri or his associates. And a wider network most certainly exists between gangs in other American cities and even overseas.
00_72_02_0004     //  I am describing a way of life that was brought over from the lemon groves of Palermo fifty years ago and hasn't changed one bit - an honored society which operates above the law.
00_72_02_0005     //  I witnessed at least fifteen occasions where murders were sanctioned by Ennio Salieri himself.  He orders the deaths of his employees and clients in the same way that a gardener pulls weeds from his flower bed.
00_72_02_0006     //  At all times we operated with layers of deniability. The boss passed orders down the ranks, and each rank distanced itself from the crime. Mugs like me and Paulie took the risks, while the top guys sat comfortably and safely in their homes.
00_72_02_0007     //  Bootlegged alcohol brought in a lot of money, but that wasn't it. I knew pimps, loan sharks, forgers, and smugglers who operated under license from Salieri and kicked money back to him.
00_72_02_0008     //  When you are a member of these gangs, your life is based on violence and will most likely end violently. Very few men who choose this line of work die a natural death.
00_72_02_0009     //  Ennio Salieri preys on people's fears of losing what they have, so they become obedient to the protection he promises them.
00_72_02_0010     //  If a regular guy like me could kill the most powerful man in the city, what good was all his power? It seemed to me that no matter how strong someone is, there'll always be somebody stronger to clip his wings.
00_72_02_0011     //  When you work for the mafia, you're respected by the people you meet.  Everybody knows you can help them, but you can also destroy their lives. The choice is yours.
00_72_02_0012     //  Most guys get into this line of work because of a thirst for power. They don't care about anybody's rules other than their own.
00_72_02_0013     //  Look at what happened during Prohibition -  a handful of poor, uneducated immigrants from Sicily became stronger than all the laws, courts, and police here in the States.  That took some doing.
00_72_02_0014     //  You know, the world isn't run by laws written on paper.  It's run by people - some according to laws, others not.  It depends on each individual how his world will be, how he makes it.
00_72_02_0015     //  There is no such thing as honor among thieves.  These men take oaths of loyalty, but to their bosses these pledges are simply means to sanction murder and justify reprisals.

00_72_03_0002     //  If the car you are driving is wanted by the cops, you will see a license plate icon above the radar. Change license plates or repaint the car at a body shop to legalize a vehicle.
00_72_03_0003     //  If the cops have your description, you will see a mugshot icon above the radar. Cops will recognize and chase you while you are a wanted man. To lose this status, you can bribe a cop or change your clothes.
00_72_03_0004     //  Use phone booths to call in a bribe and lose your wanted status. You cannot use a phone booth while in sight of the cops, so you need to lose them first.
00_72_03_0005     //  Sprinting also allows you to climb over obstacles like fences, cars, and crates. Climbing over obstacles is a good way to elude gangsters and cops.
00_72_03_0006     //  The citizens of the city will report you for serious crimes. The cops don't need to see you commit an offense to get your description.
00_72_03_0007     //  To avoid speeding fines, use a vehicle's speed limiter. Driving carefully in the city is a good way to avoid both the police and large repair bills for your favorite cars.
00_72_03_0008     //  Picking the locks of cars is a good way to avoid unwanted attention. If you are already being chased, then smashing the window might be the best option.
00_72_03_0009     //  Sticking up shops is a quick way to raise money and obtain free goods if you are desperate, but it's also a surefire way of getting police attention.
00_72_03_0010     //  Displaying weapons in public is illegal. Keep all weapons hidden when walking the streets; only take them out when you intend to use them.
00_72_03_0011     //  Crush cars using The Beast at Mike Bruski's scrapyard to raise money. Derek Pappalardo also buys luxury 1950s car models to export to South America.
00_72_03_0012     //  Save your favorite cars in your garage to build your collection. Upgrade them to ensure you are always driving the fastest cars. Just be sure to store them after you visit the body shop.
00_72_03_0013     //  Your health recovers over time. However, after taking too much damage, your maximum health limit will be reduced. Eating or drinking will replenish the health bar back to full capacity.
00_72_03_0014     //  The police in Empire Bay are a force to be reckoned with. Make sure you are carrying cash in case you need to bribe a cop for minor offenses.
00_72_03_0015     //  There are three radio stations in Empire Bay. Central plays the latest pop hits, Classic is for fans of older tunes, and Delta is the home of rhythm and blues.

00_72_03_0020     //  Search walls and alleyways around the city to collect posters of wanted criminals. View the mugshots of these dangerous criminals in the Collectibles menu.

00_72_03_0022     //  Enemy gangsters roam the streets of Empire Bay. Attacking them will cause other gang members to join the fight.
00_72_03_0023     //  Visit body shops to personalize cars and enhance vehicle performance. Upgraded vehicles make it easy to escape from the police.
00_72_03_0024     //  Use cover to stay out of sight from police in the city.
00_72_03_0025     //  A wanted car will stay that way until you take action to legalize it. It's usually cheaper to change your plates than to bribe the police.
00_72_03_0026     //  Empire Bay police expect you to obey the speed limit. Use the speed limiter function to drive safely. If the cops want to give you a speeding ticket, you can pull over and pay it or risk further retaliation by trying to escape.
00_72_03_0027     //  If a vehicle takes too much damage it will break down. You can fix a broken car engine by popping the hood, but full repairs can only happen at a body shop.
00_72_03_0028     //  If a car's tires are shot out, it will be difficult to handle. Shooting a car's gas tank will cause it to explode.
00_72_03_0029     //  Taking cover during gunfights is essential to staying alive. Almost any solid object can be used as cover. Use the zoom function to aim and shoot around cover objects.

00_72_03_0031     //  Be careful not to pull a weapon inside a gun shop. The owner is usually armed.
00_72_03_0032     //  If the cops are chasing you, keep an eye out for shortcuts and alleyways.
00_72_03_0033     //  The more crimes you commit, the higher the density of police on the streets of the city.
00_72_03_0034     //  To better avoid the cops while speeding, check the radar for cops in your vicinity.
00_72_03_0035     //  Use the handbrake to help make tight turns at high speed.
00_72_03_0036     //  When you're in a fist fight, be sure to dodge your opponent's blows. If you stay too close to an opponent he'll clam up, so pull back if an enemy is constantly dodging your blows.
00_72_03_0037     //  Be careful driving during the winter. Icy roads offer less traction.
00_72_03_0038     //  If you are trying to avoid attention, sneak up behind enemies while crouched to perform a stealth kill.
00_72_03_0039     //  When you have a wanted status, any cop in the city that sees you will give chase.
00_72_03_0040     //  Certain places in the city, like mob-run shops and bars are considered friendly locations. These are places that you would not want to damage, so the use of weapons is disallowed.
00_72_03_0041     //  Stay behind cover while reloading so you are less of a target. Almost any object that looks like a cover point will be usable, including cars. Staying out in the open during a gunfight is like buying a one-way ticket to the morgue.

01_04_00_0005     //  Corporal, corporal, you alright? C'mon, we gotta get out of here, let's go, c'mon!
01_04_00_0006     //  f_Clear!
01_04_00_0007     //  f_The rest of them must be here somewhere.
01_04_00_0008     //  ehh, alright...
01_04_00_0010     //  f_Come on. There has to be more of them!
01_04_00_0020     //  f_No prisoners. If you find anyone alive, put a bullet through his head.
01_04_00_0021     //  f_No prisoners. If you find anyone alive, put a bullet through his head.
01_04_00_0030     //  f_I'm telling you, I don't like this...
01_04_00_0040     //  f_Do what he says. We should kill anyone we find.
01_04_00_0050     //  f_What are you two talking about?!
01_04_00_0060     //  f_I was telling my friend to be careful.
01_04_00_0070     //  f_Don't bother with being careful, just do as you are told!
01_04_00_0080     //  f_Come on, let's check the next room.
01_04_00_0090     //  f_Don't shoot, boys! You know me. I have an offer for you. The war is over!
01_04_00_0095     //  f_The Americans have come to liberate us. They are our friends. They will get rid of Mussolini for us.
01_04_00_0100     //  f_If you don't do anything stupid, you can go home to your families today. You're safe. I guarantee this! You know you can trust me. What do you say?
01_04_00_0110     //  f_Come on, boys. Trust me, I'm telling the truth. Your mothers and wives are waiting for you at home.
01_04_00_0120     //  f_You don't want to leave them home alone, what if something happens to them? You know how cruel the bandits are these days.
01_04_00_0130     //  n_That's it, boys. Leave the weapons here and go home! I'm happy for you, and if you ever need anything, you know where to find me.
01_04_00_0140     //  n_What the hell is that? Who the hell does he think he is?!
01_04_00_0150     //  n_Is that really... Don Calo?
01_04_00_0160     //  n_Yes, yes - I remember him from my cousin's wedding...
01_04_00_0170     //  f_Who the hell is that? You know him?!
01_04_00_0180     //  f_Everyone knows him. Don Calo, he's a man of honor.
01_04_00_0190     //  n_That's a stupid American trick, don't tell me you believe him!
01_04_00_0200     //  n_No, it's the Don for sure. You Italians should take some local advice for once. Should we surrender?
01_04_00_0210     //  n_We will never surrender! Don't listen to that traitor!
01_04_00_0220     //  n_If you surrender, I will shoot you where you stand, you stupid Sicilian hicks!
01_04_00_0230     //  f_Asshole.
01_04_00_0240     //  f_Yeah. We should have done that sooner.
01_04_00_0250     //  Don Calo, the head of the Sicilian mob. An entire garrison of troops surrendered that day. Why? Because he told 'em to.
01_50_00_0027     //  Pick up Pietro.
01_50_00_0292     //  Search the guy
01_51_01_0001     //  Follow the old man.

02_01_00_0050     //  How'd you know?
02_01_00_0060     //  I got my sources. Come on, let's take a ride.

02_01_00_0080     //  Comes with the territory.
02_01_00_0090     //  I know you're itching to get home, but first, let's get a beer.
02_01_00_0100     //  Yeah, sure.

02_01_00_0235     //  Salut!
02_01_00_0241     //  So how come you're back? They let you out early for good behavior?
02_01_00_0250     //  Na, I took a bullet a couple of months back, spent some time in the hospital, and now I'm on leave.
02_01_00_0260     //  Wait, wh-wh-wh-hold it... you mean you gotta go back?
02_01_00_0270     //  Hehe, what did you think? The war ain't over yet.
02_01_00_0280     //  You don't want to go back, do you?
02_01_00_0290     //  Ah, of course not, but what can I do?
02_01_00_0300     //  One minute! Wait right here...
02_01_00_0301     //  Hey, Giuseppe, it's Joe. Remember last week, you know ...
02_01_00_0302     //  ... the guy, the guy's name is Vito Scaletta ...
02_01_00_0305     //  Thanks, Giuseppe. Alright, I'll see you later.
02_01_00_0310     //  OK, listen up. It "appears" that your injury is much more "serious" than it first appeared and the doctors say you can't fight no more.
02_01_00_0320     //  What!? Oh, whoa, whoa  - Did you just...!?
02_01_00_0330     //  Like I said, I know people. You get all the official paperwork tomorrow. When it comes to the right stamps and signatures, it's just a question of money...
02_01_00_0331     //  Like I said, I know people. You get all the official paperwork tomorrow. When it comes to the right stamps and signatures, it's just a question of money...
02_01_00_0340     //  You're kidding me, right? Isn't that a bit risky? It's me that could end up in the slammer, you know. And how am I going to pay for it?
02_01_00_0350     //  I got it covered. Think of it as a welcome home present. And don't worry. The documents will be clean. Trust me.
02_01_00_0360     //  Well... thanks...
02_01_00_0370     //  You're welcome. Come un frate, you're like a brother to me...
02_01_00_0380     //  Now you can start thinking about what you're gonna do next.
02_01_00_0390     //  Sure, but first I gotta go home.
02_01_00_0400     //  Alright. You want a ride?
02_01_00_0410     //  No thanks. I want to walk around a little, see what's changed since I been gone.
02_01_00_0420     //  No problem. Say hello to your sister for me. Come see me tomorrow. We got a lot to talk about.
02_01_00_0421     //  No problem. Say hello to your sister for me. Come see me tomorrow. We got a lot to talk about.
02_01_00_0430     //  I can't believe you just got me out of the service. Thanks again.
02_01_00_0440     //  No problem.
02_01_00_0445     //  I'll catch up with you tomorrow.
02_02_00_0010     //  Hi, Mamma. I'm back.
02_02_00_0020     //  Vito! Vito, my boy! My boy is home!
02_02_00_0025     //  I thought I never see you again! Francesca and me, we wait and we wait for you!
02_02_00_0030     //  Hey, sis, what's going on? C'mere...
02_02_00_0040     //  Vito! Oh, I'm so glad you're finally home!
02_02_00_0050     //  Sit down, sit down, you must be hungry, Vito. Francesca made you a special dinner. Zuppa di pollo... It's good for you.
02_02_00_0051     //  Sit down, sit down, you must be hungry, Vito. Francesca made you a special dinner. Zuppa di pollo... It's good for you.
02_02_00_0060     //  Wow, looks good, Frankie...
02_02_00_0061     //  It's a shame your papa didn't live to see this. He would be so proud, Vito.
02_02_00_0070     //  Yeah, sure...
02_02_00_0080     //  Vito! You know better.
02_02_00_0081     //  Sorry, Mamma, sorry...
02_02_00_0110     //  Bless us, O Lord! And these Thy gifts for which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.
02_02_00_0111     //  n_ Bless us, O Lord! And these Thy gifts for which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.
02_02_00_0112     //  n_ Bless us, O Lord! And these Thy gifts for which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.
02_02_00_0130     //  Amen.
02_02_00_0320     //  So you have to go back soon?
02_02_00_0330     //  Actually, uh, it looks like I won't.
02_02_00_0340     //  Really!? How come?
02_02_00_0350     //  Uh, Joe's taking care of it for me.
02_02_00_0360     //  JOE! Do you want to get into trouble again?
02_02_00_0370     //  Mamma, would you rather me go back and get shot again?
02_02_00_0380     //  No, no....
02_02_00_0390     //  Exactly. Joe probably saved my life.
02_02_00_0400     //  So what are you going to do now?
02_02_00_0410     //  I don't know. Probably get a place and find a job.
02_02_00_0420     //  Promise that you won't get in any more trouble with that Joe.
02_02_00_0421     //  You know, your papa used to work for this man at the waterfront named Papalardo. He's in the union. You could talk to him, work hard like you were your papa.
02_02_00_0422     //  Talk to him. Please, promise me you go talk to him today.
02_02_00_0430     //  OK, Mamma, OK. I promise.
02_02_00_0440     //  Grazie a Dio!
02_02_00_1000     //  ...I don't give a damn.
02_02_00_1010     //  I'm sorry.
02_02_00_1011     //  We'll get the money, I promise.
02_02_00_1020     //  I don't care if you gotta sell everything you got -
02_02_00_1030     //  n_Hey, hey!
02_02_00_1031     //  What the hell's going on here?!
02_02_00_1080     //  You mind your business, asshole!
02_02_00_1090     //  Oh yeah?
02_02_00_1100     //  Vito.
02_02_00_1101     //  No!
02_02_00_1110     //  Yeah?
02_02_00_1120     //  Urgh!
02_02_00_1200     //  Aw, fuck this!
02_02_00_1210     //  Yeah, that's right, get the fuck out of here!
02_02_00_1230     //  You're gonna be sorry, the both of you's!
02_02_00_1250     //  What the hell was that all about?
02_02_00_1260     //  I'm sorry, Vito. We didn't want to bother you with this.
02_02_00_1270     //  Bother me? Bother me with what? C'mon, tell me what's going on here, Frankie!
02_02_00_1280     //  Right before he died, Papa borrowed money - a lot of money - from a loan shark, thinking he'd get a better job and pay him back. We found out right after you left for the war.
02_02_00_1290     //  How much?
02_02_00_1300     //  Two thousand dollars.
02_02_00_1310     //  What? Shit...
02_02_00_1320     //  The worst thing is this guy wants it all back by the end of this week, otherwise... the debt goes up again.
02_02_00_1330     //  I ain't gonna make that kind of money working at the port. Who is this guy?
02_02_00_1340     //  I don't know, Mamma won't tell me. It's OK, Vito. We'll manage somehow.
02_02_00_1350     //  Don't worry. I'll take care of this... I promise.
02_02_00_1355     //  Thanks, Vito. Take care of yourself.
02_02_00_1356     //  I gotta get my hands on two grand, fast... I bet Joe could help me out.
02_03_00_0010     //  Oh, is this a bad time?
02_03_00_0020     //  Haha, what are you kidding, no, not at all!
02_03_00_0021     //  I picked up these broads on my way back from the store. I've been waiting for you.
02_03_00_0022     //  I picked up these broads on my way back from the store. I been waiting for you.
02_03_00_0030     //  Come on in. Let's talk.
02_03_00_0031     //  Ugh... You disgusting pig.
02_03_00_0040     //  Alright, girls, that's it for now. I got business.
02_03_00_0050     //  Stop by tomorrow, OK? We'll pick up where we left off. Chop chop.
02_03_00_0060     //  Come on, Joey! Why do we have to stop when we can all have fun?
02_03_00_0070     //  The fun's over, baby. Later, I said. Me and Vito here haven't seen each other for a long time. We got a lot of catching up to do.
02_03_00_0080     //  Looks like you're doing OK, Joey boy.
02_03_00_0090     //  Not bad. I tell you, that little Spanish broad is fucking wild.
02_03_00_0100     //  So how'd it go at home?
02_03_00_0110     //  Good. Mamma wasn't thrilled when I mentioned your name, though. You know how she is. She wants me to get a straight job.
02_03_00_0120     //  You gonna look for one?
02_03_00_0130     //  I don't know, but I sure as hell ain't gonna make the same mistake my old man did. I got to pay off his debts then get back on my feet and get my own place.
02_03_00_0131     //  I need to make some real money and punching a clock ain't gonna cut it.
02_03_00_0140     //  Hey, you can stay with me as long as you need to. And we'll find you a job where you can make good money without killing yourself, alright?
02_03_00_0150     //  Music to my ears. Right now I'm living off the twenty bucks the state gives me every week.
02_03_00_0160     //  Hehehe, I know lots of people who pay well for, uh, "risky" jobs, so to speak... I'm sure I can line something up for my oldest friend. The working man's a sucker, that's for damn sure.
02_03_00_0170     //  You said it.
02_03_00_0180     //  OK, step one - I gotta introduce you to Giuseppe so we can pick up them discharge papers. Let's go.
02_04_00_0050     //  Hey, look who's here.
02_04_00_0060     //  Hey, Mikey Boy, what's going on?
02_04_00_0070     //  Shit, Mike! You could wash your fucking hands once in a while. Now I need a fucking bath!
02_04_00_0080     //  Hey, I been working. Working people occasionally get dirty, you know. Besides, I just wiped them off.
02_04_00_0090     //  With what? The same fucking rag you use to clean the toilet, you filthy fuck?
02_04_00_0100     //  Put a lid on it. What are you, from the health department or do you want to do some business?
02_04_00_0110     //  Business, of course. This here's my friend Vito. Vito, this is Mike Bruski; but don't shake his hand, I ain't got that much soap at home.
02_04_00_0120     //  Nice to meet you, Vito.
02_04_00_0130     //  Uh, me and Vito go way back. He's just come back from overseas and he needs some cash. So, I figure he can help with your, uh, "supply problem." I can vouch for him.
02_04_00_0140     //  Uh huh. OK. Joe told you about our side business, right?
02_04_00_0150     //  Yeah.
02_04_00_0160     //  I only want regular cars, nothing fancy. You get a cut of every car. I take as many as I can handle.
02_04_00_0161     //  And don't bring no cops around, OK? If they follow you here, I don't know your ass from Jesus. You get me?
02_04_00_0170     //  Got it.
02_04_00_0180     //  Goddamnit Mike! You put your grubby mitts on my fucking coat! I paid a fortune for this thing!
02_04_00_0190     //  Alright, calm down or I'll stick 'em up your ass, you sissy.
02_04_00_0200     //  Do you know what dry cleaning costs these days?
02_04_00_0201     //  Plenty, and who knows if they can even get this filth out.
02_04_00_0210     //  Jesus Christ.
02_04_00_0211     //  Will you shut up?!
02_04_00_0218     //  Vito, listen to me - I need a Walter coupé today. I got a few people looking for parts, but I can't find a car.
02_04_00_0220     //  ...Because you don't know where to look! Every time I drive down Hunters, I see one parked by a bar there. I think the place is called The Lone Star.
02_04_00_0230     //  Isn't that a mulignon neighborhood. I'll stick out like a sore thumb.
02_04_00_0240     //  Alright look, I'll give you three hundred and fifty bucks for it. It's worth the risk, right?
02_04_00_0250     //  Four hundred.
02_04_00_0260     //  Haha. Alright... Deal.
02_04_00_0270     //  Alright Vito, come on, let's go. Andiamo.
02_04_00_0280     //  Meantime, I'll be sending you the cleaning bill for my coat!
02_04_00_0285     //  Yeah, I'll change my address, you rat prick.
02_04_00_0350     //  OK, listen up, this is your maiden voyage, so to speak. So try not to fuck it up, huh?
02_04_00_1180     //  Here, Vito, take this. Just in case...
02_04_00_1190     //  Hey... nice.
02_04_00_1195     //  Hey Mike! You mind if I test this thing out here?
02_04_00_1200     //  Sure, knock yourself out.
02_04_00_1201     //  Here ya go, aim for that old wreck over there.
02_05_00_0010     //  It's that cream-colored baby over there. Be careful. Do it quick and get the fuck out of there. Break a window if you have to and go. I'll wait for you back at Mike's.
02_05_00_0020     //  What if I run into problems?
02_05_00_0030     //  Then you deal with 'em. Look, consider this a test. If you fail, I hear they're hiring down at the factory.
02_05_00_0040     //  Right. Just asking.
02_05_00_0050     //  Good luck, pal. I'll see you back at Mike's.
02_05_00_0073     //  Hey! Hey what you doing motherfucker!
02_06_00_0010     //  Hey! Mission accomplished! How'd it go?
02_06_00_0020     //  Piece of cake, except for the fact that the car belonged to a bunch of moolies who immediately tried to kill me right after you left!
02_06_00_0030     //  Eh, probably the Bombers. Hunters' their neighborhood. Guys like that you don't have to worry about them. They just hang out on the street, talk shit, steal shit, and smoke dope.
02_06_00_0040     //  Let's see what we got here...
02_06_00_0043     //  Hmm, nice. No stains. Clean.
02_06_00_0047     //  Where'd that lowlife get the money for this? Probably stole it himself. It's nice, though.
02_06_00_0050     //  How much did I say I'd give you for it again?
02_06_00_0060     //  Six hundred.
02_06_00_0070     //  Hahahoho! I like your buddy, Joe! Here's your four hundred bucks.
02_06_00_0080     //  Stop by again, OK? We can do some more business.
02_06_00_0090     //  Yeah, you bet, Mike.
02_06_00_0100     //  I'll see you, Mike, I'll stop by again real soon.
02_06_00_0110     //  Me, too.
02_06_00_0120     //  Alright, boys. See you later.
02_06_00_0130     //  Here's your three hundred bananas. I'm taking my cut as the middle man. Next time, you're on your own.
02_06_00_0140     //  Alright! Thanks, Joe.
02_07_00_0510     //  Hey, Giuseppe! I brought you a new customer.
02_07_00_0520     //  Hello, Joe.
02_07_00_0521     //  He's, uh, straight up, right?
02_07_00_0530     //  Yes, sir, all the way. This here's Vito, my oldest friend.
02_07_00_0531     //  This is Giuseppe, the best safecracker in Empire Bay.
02_07_00_0540     //  Retired, please.
02_07_00_0541     //  How are you? The papers for you?
02_07_00_0550     //  Yeah, they are. You got 'em finished already?
02_07_00_0560     //  It was a pain in the ass, but sure, they're done.
02_07_00_0570     //  Well, thanks. This really gonna work?
02_07_00_0580     //  Nobody from the army will bother you again, trust me.
02_07_00_0590     //  You see? What'd I tell you? Here's the money. Take your papers, Vito.
02_11_00_0010     //  n_  ...munching food...
02_11_00_0011     //  Whoa, close the door, it's windy! What do you want?
02_11_00_0020     //  Uh, yeah, I'm looking for a Mister Papalardo.
02_11_00_0030     //  Oh, yeah? Why?
02_11_00_0040     //  My name is Vito Scaletta. My old man used to work for him and I'm looking for a job, so I came here.
02_11_00_0050     //  Well... You're in the right spot, sonny boy. Federico Papalardo at your service. You can call me Derek. I think I remember your dad.
02_11_00_0055     //  Good guy, but drank like a fish. What's he up to these days?
02_11_00_0060     //  He's dead.
02_11_00_0070     //  Oh... Well, we all got to go sometime, right, Steve?
02_11_00_0075     //  Sure, Derek.
02_11_00_0080     //  So, you need a job, huh? Well, you're in luck. We just got a new shipment to unload. Steve will show you around. Now scram, my steak's getting cold.
02_11_00_0090     //  Hey, you done?
02_12_00_0020     //  Yeah I'm done. And you can keep the ten bucks! When I said I needed a job, I didn't mean slave labor.
02_12_00_0030     //  Whatever. Get the fuck out of here then. Don't show your face around here again.
02_12_00_0040     //  Yeah, don't worry. I can make a hundred times more working for Barbaro Incorporated.
02_12_00_0050     //  Wait!... You said Barbaro? Joe Barbaro?
02_12_00_0060     //  Yeah. So what?
02_12_00_0070     //  Shit! Nobody who works with Joe would carry crates for ten bucks! What the hell are you doing?
02_12_00_0080     //  Come with me.
02_12_00_0090     //  What now?
02_12_00_0100     //  Well, this one don't like manual labor.
02_12_00_0110     //  What the fuck!
02_12_00_0120     //  Said he works with Joe Barbaro.
02_12_00_0130     //  Bullshit. Who'd want to load crates if he works with Joe?
02_12_00_0140     //  You'll have to explain this one to me, sonny boy. What's your story?
02_12_00_0150     //  Uh, well, my mother wanted me to come talk to you about an honest job, but I-I need some real money, so this ain't going to cut it.
02_12_00_0160     //  Hehehe, damn women! They're all the same. Right, Steve?!
02_12_00_0170     //  Sure, Derek.
02_12_00_0180     //  She doesn't want you hanging around with Joe, right? Hehehe. My mother was the same way and look what become of me! Union boss! I got the whole fucking waterfront under my thumb.
02_12_00_0181     //  So how's Joe?
02_12_00_0190     //  Pretty good, I guess.
02_12_00_0200     //  How'd you meet up with him?
02_12_00_0210     //  Uh, we go way back to the old neighborhood. I just come back from overseas and he's putting me up until I can get back on my feet.
02_12_00_0220     //  Listen, you gotta understand a person in my position's gotta be careful.
02_12_00_0230     //  Certainly.
02_12_00_0240     //  So you won't mind if I give Joe a call, right?
02_12_00_0245     //  No, go ahead.
02_12_00_0250     //  Now where'd I put his number... Oh! Here it is.
02_12_00_0260     //  He might not be home...
02_12_00_0261     //  That wouldn't be good.
02_12_00_0270     //  Hi, Joe! Hey, this is Derek... Listen, I got this guy here...
02_12_00_0275     //  Uh, what'd you say your name was?
02_12_00_0280     //  Vito.
02_12_00_0290     //  Vito. He's looking for a job, he says he's a friend of yours. A good friend. I just wanted to check with you first...
02_12_00_0295     //  Aha.
02_12_00_0300     //  Sure. War hero and all that shit ... Alright, alright, thanks then. I talk to you later.
02_12_00_0310     //  Sorry pal, I had to check you out. Joe says you just come back from Italy. You must be able to handle yourself. You want to make a little more money, I got just the thing.
02_12_00_0315     //  The guys here at the port are supposed to pay a monthly fee to the barber, but half of them never cough it up. I need someone to give 'em a little nudge... Ten bucks a man.
02_12_00_0320     //  What if they don't need a haircut?
02_12_00_0330     //  Well, then you'll have to convince them otherwise.
02_12_00_0340     //  I see. What if somebody makes a fuss?
02_12_00_0350     //  Then you kick the shit out of them!
02_12_00_0360     //  Well, let's say you teach them a lesson that doesn't require that they miss work, you got it? Which is why Steve ain't doing the job. Right Steve?
02_12_00_0370     //  Right, boss.
02_12_00_0380     //  Collect at least a hundred fifty bucks and I'll give you fifty. Just for walking around, taking in the sea air, and meeting new people. Easy fucking money, huh? What do you say?
02_13_00_0010     //  Here's the money, boss man.
02_13_00_0020     //  Good job. Here's your share.
02_13_00_0030     //  I watched you take care of Bill. You were good. Steve damn near got his ass kicked when he tried that, right, Steve?
02_13_00_0040     //  Yeah. Right, Derek.
02_13_00_0050     //  Here's a bonus for sorting him out.
02_13_00_0051     //  That guy's been a real fucking pain.
02_13_00_0060     //  Thanks.
02_13_00_0070     //  Now get outta here kid. I gotta be getting back to business. And say hello to your mother for me! Tell her you got yourself a job as my new assistant!
02_13_00_0080     //  Yeah, will do. I'll see you later.
02_51_00_0001     //  HOME SWEET HOME
02_51_01_0001     //  Walk to your mother's.

03_02_00_0020     //  I came right over as soon as you called. What's going on?

03_02_00_0080     //  Here, he's coming... Don't say nothing stupid.
03_02_00_0090     //  Hey Henry! How are you?
03_02_00_0100     //  Hiya Joe... This the guy?
03_02_00_0110     //  Yeah, this is Vito, an old friend of mine.
03_02_00_0120     //  Good to meet you, Henry.
03_02_00_0130     //  You vouch for him?
03_02_00_0140     //  Absolutely, Henry. Trust him with my life.
03_02_00_0150     //  OK, listen. I got a job for you. The money's good. I need gas stamps. They're worth a fortune now because of the gas shortage.
03_02_00_0160     //  Where can we get 'em?
03_02_00_0170     //  In the Office of Price Administration.
03_02_00_0180     //  Ah, that's a federal government agency.  Isn't that a little risky?
03_02_00_0190     //  What? Too much for you?
03_02_00_0200     //  No...no, no... Just trying to think of how we can pull it off.
03_02_00_0210     //  Ah, can't be that hard. The stamps are kept in the safe at night, but the keys are probably around there somewhere.
03_02_00_0220     //  You got somebody inside?
03_02_00_0230     //  Yeah, one of our guys, his sister works there.
03_02_00_0240     //  Can she help us out?
03_02_00_0250     //  Ask her yourself.
03_02_00_0260     //  Her name's Maria Agnello. Here's the address. Tell her I sent you.
03_02_00_0270     //  Alright, what about the safe? What if the keys aren't there?
03_02_00_0280     //  That's your problem.
03_02_00_0300     //  What's the job pay?
03_02_00_0310     //  I'll give you six hundred bucks for ten thousand gallons worth of stamps.
03_02_00_0320     //  OK, we're in.
03_02_00_0330     //  No, no, I need Vito to do this alone. I got another job for you, Joe.
03_02_00_0340     //  So, what do you say, Vito?
03_02_00_0350     //  Yeah. Sure.
03_02_00_0360     //  Hey, and don't forget to take a piece with you. You never know what's gonna happen. Better to be safe than sorry. A capiche?
03_02_00_0370     //  Wait, wait, wait... This isn't some liquor store stick-up. I want this to be a clean job. If you kill anybody, your cut drops to a third. Capiche?
03_02_00_0380     //  Yeah, I got it, no problem.
03_02_00_0390     //  OK. When you're done, you come back here and we'll settle up.
03_02_00_0395     //  Alright, I'll see you.
03_02_00_0400     //  Good luck, Vito.
03_04_00_0010     //  Well? How'd you make out?
03_04_00_0020     //  Uh, things got out of hand. There's nothing I could do about it.
03_04_00_0030     //  We had an agreement, remember? You only get a third of the money if there's any shooting.
03_04_00_0040     //  Piece of cake. They're in for a shock in the morning.
03_04_00_0050     //  That's good. I see Joe knows how to pick his friends.
03_04_00_0060     //  Argh, let's see what we got here.
03_04_00_0070     //  Ah, shit!
03_04_00_0080     //  Something wrong?
03_04_00_0090     //  You bet your ass there's something wrong. These stamps you took have an expiration date, and that date is tomorrow!
03_04_00_0100     //  So, uh, what exactly does that mean?...
03_04_00_0110     //  It means they're gonna be fucking worthless. But wait... if you can get them to the gas station attendants by midnight, they'll be able to stamp 'em and redeem 'em.
03_04_00_0120     //  You better bring 'em to every gas station in town. They gotta get there by midnight or we're screwed. You don't sell 'em in time, you get nothing.
03_04_00_0130     //  Wait a minute! That wasn't our deal! You didn't say anything about any expiration dates.
03_04_00_0140     //  Well, shit happens, doesn't it? Look, you pull this off, I won't forget it, trust me. Now get going... The faster you unload 'em, the more money you get.
03_50_00_0010     //  Yeah, can I help you?
03_50_00_0020     //  Yeah, hello, ma'am, Henry Tomasino sent me. He said you might be able to help me with a little "problem" down at the Office of Price Administration.
03_50_00_0030     //  Yeah, I heard about that. What do you need from me?
03_50_00_0040     //  Uh... I need to get in there tonight.
03_50_00_0050     //  Alright, tell you what, my sister's in the hospital right now. If you give me a lift over there, I'll tell you everything you need to know. It's right across the street from the OPA, so it ain't like you're gonna be going out of your way.

04_02_00_0100     //  n_ What?! Since when do his fucking problems become my fucking problems! The fucking prick is jerking us around! He had his chance to pay. Now I'm gonna have to take it from him.
04_02_00_0101     //  Alright, alright. I'll only take what he owes for now. Just for now. But when Alberto hears about this, the shit is gonna hit the fan, believe you me.

04_02_00_0130     //  Somebody you don't need to know right now.
04_02_00_0140     //  Alright, listen up. There's a guy who owes the boss some money. He borrowed it to open some big jewelry store and he's not paying it back fast enough. We're gonna collect his payment tonight.
04_02_00_0141     //  In jewels. Plus, uh... a little extra for our trouble. Joe, fill him in.
04_02_00_0150     //  The jewelry store's in the shopping mall in the middle of town. There's no guards at night, so all we gotta do is pick the lock and waltz right in.

04_02_00_0181     //  n_... drinking ...
04_02_00_0190     //  Because it is simple. Why's everything gotta be so fucking complicated with you?
04_02_00_0200     //  Yeah, says the guy who can barely change a lightbulb.
04_02_00_0210     //  Look, don't worry. I thought of everything. I got these phone company uniforms so we can pretend to be fixing something.
04_02_00_0220     //  Fair enough, let's go.
04_02_00_0230     //  Alright! We're gonna rob this fuck blind. All we gotta do is wait until dark...

04_03_00_0050     //  Hehe, you're a little late, chief. There's nothing left here for you.
04_03_00_0060     //  Fuck off, fatso! This is our heist! If you want to get out of here in one piece you better hand over everything you've got.
04_03_00_0070     //  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, the sign outside didn't say Brian O'Neill's place. If it did I wouldn't have robbed it.
04_03_00_0071     //  Instead, I would have set it on fire -
04_03_00_0072     //  And I suggest you get lost before the cops show up.

04_03_00_0100     //  Let's get the fuck out of here!
04_04_00_0010     //  Fuck off, copper! I didn't do nothing! I want me lawyer.
04_04_00_0020     //  n_ Shut your mouth, dirtbag, and get in. Your mouthpiece can meet you down at the station.
04_04_00_0030     //  n_ I don't want no fucking "mouthpiece." We want a fucking lawyer!
04_04_00_0040     //  n_ Situation under control. Suspects were armed. Looks like one of the Irish gangs...
04_04_00_0050     //  n_ Hahaha...

04_04_00_0085     //  Shit, the cops! C'mon, get out of the light, let's go! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

04_04_00_0090     //  Quiet, they're looking for us.
04_04_00_0091     //  Will you shut up?! Joe, Jesus Christ, you're gonna get us fucking arrested over here. Hahaha. Stop it, c'mon, what's wrong with you.
04_04_00_0092     //  n_laughing
04_04_00_0094     //  Will you be quiet?
04_04_00_0100     //  Don't worry, give me your bag. I'll go ditch the goods.
04_04_00_0110     //  Alright pal, meet you back home. Try not to get pinched on the way there.
04_05_00_0010     //  Shit!
04_05_00_0020     //  Jesus, be careful! Almost lost you there.

05_01_00_0021     //  Joe ain't here right now. He said for you to meet him for lunch at Freddy's.
05_01_00_0030     //  I see.
05_01_00_0040     //  Too bad you were passed out when I came in. We could've partied. Hmm... Maybe next time, doll. Bye.
05_01_00_0050     //  Ahh, that was something...

05_02_00_0010     //  Hey, Vito, this is Luca Gurino. He'd like to talk to you and Joe. Luca, this is Vito.
05_02_00_0030     //  Good to meet you, Mr. Gurino.
05_02_00_0040     //  No need to be so formal. Call me Luca. Take a seat, Vito.
05_02_00_0090     //  I heard about your run-in with the micks. Heh. Great fucking story! Hehe. And I want to congratulate you two... on a job well done. Salut!
05_02_00_0091     //  Ah salut.
05_02_00_0092     //  n_ ... eating ...
05_02_00_0150     //  I was in the war, Mr. Gurino. All I did was kill people I was told to kill. People the president pointed his finger at.
05_02_00_0160     //  Hehehehe, that's good, the president, yeah, I like that. Yeah. But you're uh... You're talking about the krauts, right? You know, the... "bad guys." That's not what I mean. Understand?
05_02_00_0161     //  n_ahahhaha
05_02_00_0162     //  n_hahaha
05_02_00_0170     //  Yeah, I understand.
05_02_00_0200     //  Good. We need guys like you. Guys who can follow orders without asking questions. You handle this next job like you handled the last one, and there's a good chance you'll be accepted into the family.
05_02_00_0205     //  After you pay the initiation fee, of course.
05_02_00_0210     //  And how much is that?
05_02_00_0220     //  Five grand apiece.
05_02_00_0230     //  That's a fucking fortune!
05_02_00_0240     //  Hey! Nobody said it was cheap, ha? But trust me, the benefits far outweigh the cost. I'll leave it up to you two to decide.
05_02_00_0250     //  Henry's gonna fill you's in on the rest. I'll see you's guys later.
05_02_00_0281     //  Thanks.
05_02_00_0282     //  So Henry, what kind of job we talking about here?
05_02_00_0290     //  I gotta take a guy out.
05_02_00_0291     //  It's my contract, but I need some help.
05_02_00_0292     //  That's where you two come in.
05_02_00_0300     //  Who's the lucky guy?
05_02_00_0310     //  Some fat fuck from across the river. The guy's been warned, but he thinks he's untouchable.
05_02_00_0320     //  Huh. And is he?
05_02_00_0330     //  Well... somebody tried to take him out once before...
05_02_00_0340     //  And?
05_02_00_0350     //  Let's just say they slightly underestimated him...
05_02_00_0360     //  How much is slightly?
05_02_00_0370     //  Fatally.
05_02_00_0380     //  That's a fancy way of saying they're dead, right?
05_02_00_0390     //  Hey, they fucked up. We won't. I rented an apartment across the street from his business. We'll sit there, and we'll wait 'til that fat fuck shows up and then boom! ...We blast his ass.
05_02_00_0400     //  How we gonna do that?
05_02_00_0410     //  With an MG-42.
05_02_00_0420     //  Uh... where are we getting an MG-42 from?
05_02_00_0430     //  Harry.
05_02_00_0431     //  Yeah.
05_02_00_0432     //  He's a vet, like you. He's got a private little gun shop over in Kingston.
05_02_00_0433     //  He can get you anything from a pea shooter to a bazooka.
05_02_00_0434     //  And you don't need no fucking gun license neither.
05_02_00_0440     //  OK, Joe and me will go to the apartment. You go pick up the machine gun at Harry's shop in Kingston. It's all paid for, just tell him I sent you.
05_02_00_0441     //  After that, meet us at the apartment. It's in Sand Island, the building across from the distillery, apartment two thirty-three.
05_02_00_0450     //  OK, apartment two thirty-three, got it. I'll meet you fellas there in a bit.
05_02_00_0451     //  Good luck, pal.
05_02_00_0452     //  Alright, see you later.
05_02_00_0500     //  What can I get you?
05_02_00_0510     //  Same thing I'm having, and hurry it up.
05_02_00_0520     //  You guys did a hell of a job. Not too many guys got the stomach for this line of work.
05_02_00_0530     //  So now, uh... I'm wondering if you's are ready to take the next step.
05_02_00_0540     //  Yeah, sure, uh, what next step?
05_02_00_0550     //  I'm talking about taking somebody out... just 'cause someone points his finger at him and tells you to do it.
05_02_00_0560     //  There you are.
05_02_00_0565     //  Heya, boss.
05_02_00_0570     //  You take care of the thing we talked about yet?
05_02_00_0580     //  Yeah, yeah. It's all under control. Henry's -
05_02_00_0590     //  That's what you said the last time. Don't disappoint me again.
05_02_00_0600     //  Boss, I - I...
05_02_00_0610     //  Don't.
05_02_00_0620     //  Now come with me, we got some other business to discuss.
05_02_00_0623     //  n_ ... eating ...
05_03_00_0005     //  Hello?
05_03_00_0010     //  So, uh, you're the guy Henry was telling me about, huh?
05_03_00_0020     //  Yeah. You got his merchandise?
05_03_00_0030     //  Hehehe, yeah. Well, here it is! MG42. Made in Germany. Hitler's Buzzsaw we called 'em! She's a beauty.
05_03_00_0031     //  25 pounds, 7.92 caliber, 1200 rounds per minute - fastest in the world - 250 round belt, 3/4 of a mile effective range, and extremely reliable.
05_03_00_0035     //  I don't know what the hell you're hunting, but unless it's in a fucking tank, sayonara baby! Hey, you need me to show you how to use it?
05_03_00_0040     //  No, thanks. I'm familiar with 'em - I was in the service, too.
05_03_00_0050     //  No shit! Wait, you're kidding me? Wait, where were you? What was it, Normandy, huh? No, Africa? Alright, let me guess, uh...
05_03_00_0060     //  Operation Husky.
05_03_00_0070     //  Yeah? What unit were you in?
05_03_00_0080     //  504th Parachute.
05_03_00_0090     //  No shit, you were a paratrooper?! That was kind of hairy, I heard.
05_03_00_0100     //  Yeah, well, it was no picnic, I tell you. I got hit so they sent me home.
05_03_00_0110     //  Yeah... any medals?
05_03_00_0120     //  Yeah. Purple Heart and the DSC.
05_03_00_0130     //  Whoa! Wait, you got a cross! Let me tell you, they don't give those babies out for nothing. I was in Normandy. We hit Utah Beach, that wasn't no picnic neither, but...
05_03_00_0150     //  ... I was crawlin' over the fence on the way back, I poked my eye out on a fucking tree branch, heh. Well, hey, it was good enough for a discharge.
05_03_00_0160     //  Uh, look, I... I really gotta get going.
05_03_00_0170     //  Alright. Hey, by the way, I'm Harry.
05_03_00_0180     //  Hey, Vito.
05_03_00_0190     //  Hey, good to meet you, Vito, real good. If you ever need some hardware, you know where to find me.
05_03_00_0200     //  Oh, hey - here you go. I hope you drove here, she's a big girl. Hmph! Good luck.
05_03_00_0210     //  Agh! Hey, thanks. Nice to meet you, Harry.
05_05_00_0001     //  n_... snoring ...
05_05_00_0002     //  n_... snoring, mumbling ...
05_05_00_0010     //  Where you from, Henry?
05_05_00_0020     //  Sicily.
05_05_00_0030     //  What brought you to the States?
05_05_00_0040     //  Mussolini.
05_05_00_0050     //  What, did he buy you a ticket?
05_05_00_0060     //  Don't be a smartass, Joe. My father was a... man of honor. Things got pretty bad for us after Mussolini came into power.
05_05_00_0065     //  My old man figured I'd either get drafted or locked up... So, he sent me to America and got me a job working for Clemente.
05_05_00_0070     //  So what happened to your father?
05_05_00_0080     //  He said he was too old to make the trip. Mussolini had him arrested... and he died in jail. They wouldn't even turn his body over for a proper burial.
05_05_00_0090     //  Gee... That's rough...
05_05_00_0100     //  So how's your English so good?
05_05_00_0140     //  They're coming. Those black cars.
05_05_00_0141     //  Alright, it's showtime.
05_05_00_0145     //  Alright, I'm on it.
05_05_00_0150     //  Vito, aim for the fat bastard. We gotta nail him before he gets in the building! Get ready.
05_05_00_0160     //  They got guns! They got guns! Up there, in that window!
05_06_00_0001     //  n_... crying ...
05_06_00_0010     //  Don't kill me... please!
05_06_00_0011     //  I got a wife... Don't do it! I'll do anything you want!
05_06_00_0012     //  Just don't kill me! ...Oh, for chrissakes!
05_06_00_0013     //  n_Agh! Aaaaaahhhhh....
05_06_00_0014     //  n_ugh, ugh!
05_06_00_0020     //  You should've thought about your wife before.
05_06_00_0021     //  Don Clemente sends his regards.
05_06_00_0025     //  The fuck, you're sorry, you...
05_06_00_0026     //  Mother... fucker!
05_06_00_0030     //  Oh fuck...
05_06_00_0031     //  n_ ugh.. ah...
05_06_00_0032     //  Argh... Alright.
05_06_00_0033     //  Ugh... oh god ... son of a...
05_06_00_0040     //  Henry! You OK? Where'd he hit you?
05_06_00_0044     //  n_To be continued...
05_06_00_0050     //  Of course I'm not fucking OK, he shot me in the fucking leg... urgh....
05_06_00_0060     //  Oh yeah, it's bleeding all over the place.
05_06_00_0070     //  Ugh! Get me to El Greco.
05_06_00_0080     //  The fucking painter?
05_06_00_0090     //  No, the fucking doctor, you idiot!
05_06_00_0091     //  The Greek guy! Lives up in Highbrook! Ugh...
05_06_00_0100     //  OK, OK, take it easy. We're going to get you there in a minute!
05_06_00_0101     //  Alright, let's get you to the car! Ugh...
05_06_00_0110     //  Ugh, oh Madonna, you're heavier than you look.
05_06_00_0120     //  n_ ugh...
05_06_00_0125     //  n_ ugh... oh God
05_06_00_0130     //  Aaaah, fuck...
05_06_00_0310     //  Vito, would you just fucking drive?
05_06_00_0320     //  Why don't you try fucking thinking for once?
05_06_00_0330     //  You're not helping here, Henry.
05_06_00_0340     //  Take it easy, will you, Henry! Relax, it's under control.
05_06_00_0350     //  I've got a hole in my leg the size of fucking golf ball and you're telling me it's under control?
05_06_00_0360     //  You're gonna have a hole in your head pretty soon if we don't get outta this. Vito, do something here!
05_06_00_0370     //  Step out of the vehicle immediately or we will open fire.
05_06_00_0380     //  This is your last warning!
05_06_00_0390     //  Show me your hands and step out of the vehicle.
05_06_00_0400     //  Come on out! You're only making it worse for yourself.
05_06_00_0410     //  Vito, would you just fucking drive?
05_06_00_0420     //  Well, fuck the cops! Get me to a doctor now!
05_06_00_0430     //  Ahhhhhh.
05_07_00_0010     //  Vito! Hey, how you doing?
05_07_00_0020     //  Shh... no no, no no, I just wanted to give you the money to pay off papa's debt.
05_07_00_0030     //  Oh, Vito, that's great... I was gonna try and see if I could pay it back in installments... I got a little money... He wouldn't hurt us...
05_07_00_0040     //  Don't be so sure. But... it doesn't matter now. Here, take it.
05_07_00_0050     //  Where'd you get all this money, Vito? You haven't done nothing you'll be sorry for, have you?
05_07_00_0060     //  Hey, don't worry, everything's fine.
05_07_00_0070     //  Thank you, Vito, thank you...
05_07_00_0080     //  No problem... Alright, look, I better be going, I don't want Ma to see me. She'll be asking where I got the money, too.
05_07_00_0090     //  Don't worry, I'll make something up.
05_07_00_0100     //  Alright. Give her a big kiss for me, OK?
05_07_00_0110     //  I will. Take care of yourself, Vito.
05_08_00_0001     //  n_ Ugh.
05_08_00_0010     //  You El Greco, the doctor?
05_08_00_0020     //  No. I'm the fucking painter.
05_08_00_0030     //  Our friend needs help or he's gonna bleed to death.
05_08_00_0040     //  Good God, Henry! Get him inside. Ellado!
05_08_00_0050     //  Wait, I got money for you. For the job, take it...
05_08_00_0055     //  And hey.... thanks for everything.
05_08_00_0060     //  You know this could've waited, but thanks.
05_08_00_0065     //  I hope you'll be OK.
05_08_00_0070     //  Yeah, me too.
05_08_00_0080     //  Thanks, doc. We owe you one.
05_08_00_0090     //  I'll stay here with Henry. Meet me at my place later.
05_08_00_0100     //  Alright.
05_10_00_0330     //  Vito, cover us!
05_10_00_0340     //  Dammit, Vito! You just gonna let 'em kill us!?
05_10_00_0350     //  Cover us, for chrissakes!
05_10_00_0351     //  Aaaghh...
05_10_00_0352     //  Jesus...
05_10_00_0353     //  Ahhhh, that hurts!
05_10_00_0354     //  Argh... Ohh..
05_10_00_0360     //  That fat fuck! He almost shot my balls off!
05_10_00_0361     //  Vito, move it, Henry ain't getting any lighter!
05_10_00_0362     //  Come on, Vito, he's bleeding all over the place, move it!
05_10_00_0363     //  Let's go, Vito, andiamo! What the fuck are you waiting for?
05_10_00_0364     //  Hurry it up, will you? This ain't as much fun as it looks!
05_10_00_0365     //  Vito, wait up! I can't go so fast!
05_10_00_0366     //  Hold on, Vito! I can't run with Henry on my back like this!
05_10_00_0367     //  Slow it down, Vito! I can't keep up with you!
05_10_00_0368     //  Careful, Vito! There's probably more of these bastards in here somewhere!
05_10_00_0370     //  Take it easy, he missed 'em by a mile.
05_10_00_0380     //  Hey! Careful! This fucking hurts!
05_10_00_0390     //  Yeah, well, you can walk if you don't quit your moaning!
05_10_00_0400     //  Hey, yeah right, no need to get pissy. I'm the one bleeding to death here!
05_10_00_0410     //  Goddamn it! I knew it! This is my thirteenth contract...it's a fucking jinx!
05_10_00_0420     //  What do you mean, you lucky bastard?
05_10_00_0421     //  If that fat fuck could shoot straight, I'd be carrying your corpse right now!
05_10_00_0430     //  Oooowwww...
05_10_00_0440     //  What's the matter!?
05_10_00_0450     //  What the fuck do you think! I'm fucking dying here!

05_10_00_0464     //  C'mon, we gotta find a way out of here.
05_10_00_0470     //  I'm in fucking pain here!
05_10_00_0480     //  Well, you're gonna have to, Henry! Looks like we gotta take the stairs.
05_10_00_0490     //  Shit, OK, let's go.
05_10_00_0500     //  You wouldn't leave me here, would you, Joe?
05_10_00_0510     //  If you don't pipe down, I might start thinking about it.
05_10_00_0520     //  Ah fuck, I don't think I can hold on much longer.
05_10_00_0540     //  Go and take care of 'em, Vito.
05_10_00_0550     //  Get rid of 'em fast, or Henry's gonna die on us.
05_10_00_0555     //  Thanks for the vote of confidence, asshole...
05_10_00_0560     //  Shit, Vito! Find a way out!
05_10_00_0580     //  C'mon, Vito, get in! You drive! We gotta get Henry to that doctor!
05_10_00_0590     //  Move it, Vito! You want Henry to bleed to death?
05_10_00_0599     //  Come on! Get in the damn car so we can get out of here!
05_10_00_0600     //  Let's go, Vito, what the fuck you waiting for!
05_20_00_0100     //  OK, Joe and me will go to the apartment.
05_20_00_0110     //  It's in Sand Island, the building across from the distillery, apartment two thirty-three.
05_20_00_0130     //  This the guy?

05_51_00_0001     //  THE BUZZSAW
05_51_01_0001     //  Drive to Freddy's to meet Joe for lunch.

05_51_01_0012     //  Mission failed: Jolanda died!
05_51_01_0013     //  Take the food back to the apartment.
05_51_01_0014     //  Mission failed: Henry died!
05_51_01_0015     //  Go see what's going on.

05_51_01_0026     //  Go meet Joe and Henry at Misery Lane.
05_51_01_0027     //  Escape the police!
05_51_02_0001     //  Joe is waiting for you at Freddy's. Go speak to him.

06_00_00_0070     //  Move it!
06_00_00_0080     //  I... I'm sorry. I can't.
06_00_00_0090     //  No, please.. Noo..
06_01_00_0008     //  n_ Yeah baby. Hahaha.

06_01_00_0011     //  n_Whoo! Come on over to daddy!
06_01_00_0012     //  n_Hey baby, don't be shy!
06_01_00_0013     //  n_Come on, new boy, daddy's got a place right here for you.
06_01_00_0014     //  n_That's right, welcome to my life.
06_01_00_0015     //  n_Welcome to hell, new boys.
06_01_00_0016     //  n_Yeeeah, that's right, get real close, so I can smell you, mmmmmmm!
06_01_00_0017     //  n_Oh yeah, you're gonna taste good, new fish.
06_01_00_0018     //  n_Aah, I could smell you from the courtyard, boy.
06_01_00_0019     //  n_Hey, welcome back, my brother.
06_01_00_0020     //  Yeah... What's it to you?

06_01_00_0029     //  n_Mmm, gonna have fun turnin' you out, sweetheart.
06_01_00_0030     //  You're under arrest for the illegal distribution of federal ration stamps. You're coming with us.
06_01_00_0031     //  n_What you lookin' at, asshole!?
06_01_00_0040     //  One of the gas station attendants ratted me up. The guy fingered me and they strong armed Mom into telling 'em where I was staying.
06_01_00_0041     //  But they had no idea who I was working for and I wasn't about to tell 'em.
06_01_00_0050     //  Henry was able to get me a lawyer, courtesy of his boss Clemente. I was up shit's creek but at least I had a paddle.
06_01_00_0051     //  Could've been a hell of a lot worse if the feds knew about any of my "other" activities.
06_01_00_0060     //  The guy was good but even he couldn't get me out of this one. It was a lost cause from day one.
06_01_00_0061     //  Three months later they handed down the verdict.
06_01_00_0070     //  ...and I find your crime to be even more serious considering the fact that you stole national resources at a time when our country needs them the most.
06_01_00_0071     //  An act the gravity of which, you, Mr. Scaletta, a decorated war veteran yourself, should clearly understand.
06_01_00_0090     //  Vittorio Antonio Scaletta, for your crimes against the people of this city and of this great country ...
06_01_00_0091     //  ... this court hereby sentences you to ten years in a federal penitentiary.
06_01_00_0110     //  The federal pen. Thieves, murderers, child molesters... they were all here. The worst of the worst.

06_02_00_0040     //  Stop right there, turn to your right.

06_02_00_0050     //  Listen up, assholes! My name is Captain Terence Stone, and this is my prison. You're here on the inside because you can't behave like normal human beings on the outside!
06_02_00_0051     //  Make no mistake - your ass belongs to me now, and you'll do what I say or you'll be sorry that you didn't.
06_02_00_0052     //  Fuck with me and I'll fuck with your sorry ass all day long. You were sent here to be rehabilitated, and rehabilitate you, we will.
06_02_00_0100     //  OK, you assholes, we're gonna cut you loose just long enough to get you's cleaned up.
06_02_00_0110     //  Now get in line and follow me!
06_03_00_0010     //  After three action-packed days of staring at the wall, I got a message from Joe to contact a guy named Leo Galante who could supposedly help me out in here.
06_03_00_0011     //  This wasn't the kind of place where you could survive on your own.
06_03_00_0020     //  What you looking at, asshole? You want to get your ass kicked, you just keep on staring, pal!
06_04_00_0020     //  I know you!
06_04_00_0030     //  You're that fucking guinea who was with Barbaro in the jewelry store! I'm in this fucking hell hole 'cause of you!
06_04_00_0040     //  You got locked up 'cause you're a stupid, crazy fuck.
06_04_00_0050     //  Hehehehehe... You know fellas, me Ma was right. There is a God!
06_04_00_0051     //  And He sent you here, you guinea bastard, so that I could pay you back!
06_04_00_0090     //  This looks interesting. Want to make a small bet?
06_04_00_0100     //  Step back! Did you hear me?
06_04_00_0101     //  Get out of here! Move it!
06_04_00_0110     //  OK, that's enough! Break it up! Both of you are going to the hole!
06_05_00_0330     //  How long you planning on keepin' him in here?
06_05_00_0340     //  Long enough to learn his lesson.
06_05_00_0350     //  That's gonna have to change. He in any shape to fight?
06_05_00_0360     //  Should be. The boys didn't knock him around too bad after the brawl in the yard.
06_05_00_0370     //  Alright, open it up.
06_05_00_0380     //  Rise and shine, Scaletta.
06_05_00_0390     //  You got yourself a visitor.
06_05_00_0400     //  My name is Leo Galante. I heard you wanted to speak to me.
06_05_00_0410     //  Yeah.
06_05_00_0420     //  One of Clemente's guys said I should contact you... said maybe you could help me out?
06_05_00_0430     //  Fuck Clemente. I don't provide protection for his guys in here.
06_05_00_0440     //  But I saw how you handled that mick who's after you, O'Neill. You could prove useful...
06_05_00_0450     //  Come with me, boy.
06_05_00_0460     //  Now listen up, fellas! This is Vito.  He's gonna be helpin' us out.
06_05_00_0470     //  Pepé here's got a big fight comin' up... against O'Neill. He needs a sparrin' partner... and from what I saw of you out there in the yard, you're just the man for the job.
06_05_00_0480     //  You're gonna help us out, kid. In return, you'll be under my protection. And who knows, maybe you'll even learn a thing or two along the way.
06_05_00_0490     //  I guess I can't say no to that offer, eh?
06_05_00_0500     //  I don't remember asking. Alright fellas, let's get this show on the road.
06_06_00_0070     //  So how close did you get to Clemente, Vito?
06_06_00_0080     //  Actually, I never met him. I always dealt with either Henry Tomasino or Luca Gurino.
06_06_00_0090     //  Hmph... I can't believe that cocksucker Gurino's still breathing...
06_06_00_0100     //  What was your deal with them?
06_06_00_0170     //  You don't gotta pay to get in, Vito. You're brought into the family once you prove that you're loyal, a good earner, and you can handle...you know, the life.
06_06_00_0175     //  In any case, this is an interesting piece of news. When this gets out, Alberto and Luca are gonna have a lot of explaining to do.
06_06_00_0360     //  Well, you know - we did a couple of jobs for 'em, and uh, Luca said he'd bring us into the family... for uh, five grand.
06_06_00_0370     //  What!
06_06_00_0380     //  Typical fucking Alberto. He's always been a crooked bastard.
06_06_00_0390     //  Uh, so, what, is that like more than usual?
06_06_00_0400     //  Yeah, like five grand more than usual.
06_06_00_0410     //  To who?
06_06_00_0420     //  Jeez...
06_06_00_0430     //  Don't worry about that. We'll talk about it some other time...
06_07_00_0010     //  Watch where you walk, gwai-lo!
06_07_00_0020     //  Maybe if your eyes were all the way open, you would've seen me coming, asshole.
06_07_00_0030     //  Nice to see you too, Mister Wu.
06_07_00_0040     //  Galante... crooked white devil.
06_07_00_0050     //  Crooked? You bet on your own guy and he lost. That's the way it works in this country.
06_07_00_0060     //  Then Wu offer you rematch.
06_07_00_0070     //  I think I can arrange that. You up to it, Vito?
06_07_00_0080     //  Chinaman, huh? Yeah, get him a stepladder and send him over.
06_07_00_0090     //  Alright Wu, it looks like you got yourself a rematch. And none of that chop-suey crap this time.
06_08_00_0110     //  Hi, Vito.
06_08_00_0120     //  Hey, Frankie... How you doing?
06_08_00_0130     //  I'm doing good. Real good... Thanks.
06_08_00_0140     //  So uh, how's things?
06_08_00_0150     //  Well... I-I got something to tell you. I'm getting married, Vito!
06_08_00_0160     //  Oh Madonna! That's great! I mean it would've been nice if he asked my permission first but... Hey, I'm happy for you.
06_08_00_0170     //  Vito, you're in jail!  Look at yourself... How'd you let this happen?
06_08_00_0180     //  Hey, I already got a lecture from the judge, huh? I don't need another one. Just... Just drop it, alright?
06_08_00_0190     //  Vito...there's something else... It's Mamma.
06_08_00_0200     //  What do you mean? What about her?
06_08_00_0210     //  She's sick, Vito. She's been like this for weeks and she's not getting any better.
06_08_00_0220     //  Look, Frankie... Go to Joe's. He's holding onto my money for me. You get her the best doctor you can find. And uh, you keep the rest as a wedding gift.
06_08_00_0230     //  Vito...
06_08_00_0240     //  No, no, I mean it. Looks like I'm not gonna need it for a while...
06_08_00_0250     //  Alright, looks like I gotta go... Uh, look, you take care of Ma... Tell her I love her.
06_08_00_0260     //  I will. And thanks, Vito. Bye.
06_09_00_0300     //  What's the hold-up here! Move your asses!
06_09_00_0310     //  Hey Frankie, we got a little "business" to take care of here, huh? Why don't you go have a smoke?
06_09_00_0320     //  Hahaha, yeah, sure, have your fun, you sick bastards.
06_09_00_0330     //  Hmmm, I like your scars, pretty boy. Where'd you get 'em?
06_09_00_0340     //  Sorry, asshole. You picked the wrong ass to drill.
06_09_00_0350     //  We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. Your choice.
06_09_00_0360     //  I got a better idea - why don't you go fuck your buddies instead.  Or better yet, go fuck yourself.
06_09_00_0370     //  OK, I guess you want it rough!
06_10_00_0010     //  Go on, boy, you know the drill.
06_10_00_0020     //  Oh, and uh, this came today.
06_10_00_0030     //  Might want to read it.  Looks important.
06_10_00_0050     //  Mamma died while Francesca was visiting me. Instead of going towards a good doctor and a wedding gift... every penny I had went to the funeral.
06_10_00_0060     //  No, no, no, nooo!
06_10_00_0070     //  Fuck!
06_11_00_0110     //  Took a little persuading, but O'Neill's all by himself right now, in the gym. Guards won't be back for a while.
06_11_00_0111     //  You're just gonna give him a good beating, break a couple of bones, same as they did to me. Got it?
06_11_00_0112     //  Yeah, I got it.
06_11_00_0114     //  Alright, come with me.
06_11_00_0115     //  Break a leg, kid.
06_11_00_0165     //  Mr. Galante wants to talk to you. Come with me.
06_11_00_0170     //  Good to have you back, kid.
06_11_00_0180     //  What the hell happened?
06_11_00_0190     //  Looks like the micks weren't up for a fair fight. A couple of 'em jumped Pepé yesterday.
06_11_00_0200     //  It was a lot more than a couple...
06_11_00_0210     //  Yeah, well, we sure as hell ain't gonna let this go.
06_11_00_0220     //  What do you got in mind?
06_11_00_0230     //  Pepé's got it all worked out.
06_11_00_0670     //  I'll wait out here. If the guards get back early, I'll warn you.
06_11_00_0680     //  OK.
06_11_00_0690     //  Alright, go for it.
06_11_00_0700     //  Hey, O'Neill, I got a little business to settle with you.
06_11_00_0710     //  Just the man I wanted to see!
06_12_00_1040     //  Shut the fuck up!
06_13_00_0001     //  n_ Pepé here is gotta have a big fight coming up, against O'Neill, and needs a sparring partner. And from what I saw of you out there in the yard, you're just the man for the job.
06_13_00_0010     //  It all worked out just fine. They never found out who did it. Leo arranged for me to relocate to his cell... Well, actually, it was more like a suite. Life was getting better by the minute.
06_13_00_0180     //  To who? I thought Clemente was the boss.
06_13_00_0200     //  You obviously don't know how things work around here. You see, there's more than one family in Empire Bay. There's three. Each family controls their own neighborhoods.
06_13_00_0201     //  There's a system of rules, and if there's any disagreements, the bosses of all the families meet to work things out. That's the Commission.
06_13_00_0210     //  Great, so what do I do now? Am I in trouble too?
06_13_00_0220     //  No, no, no... Nothing like that. You're young, you're smart, and you've proven you can keep your mouth shut.
06_13_00_0225     //  You're exactly the type of guy everybody wants working for 'em.
06_13_00_0230     //  Yeah, but I don't even know who these other guys are...
06_13_00_0240     //  There's two other bosses besides Clemente. One is Carlo Falcone, and the other is Frank Vinci. Carlo is young, and ambitious...
06_13_00_0250     //  The guy's a frickin' nutjob...
06_13_00_0260     //  He's new blood, whereas Don Vinci is a man of honor, he respects the old ways.
06_13_00_0270     //  You know these guys?
06_13_00_0280     //  You could say that. I'm Frank Vinci's consigliere. You think being just a regular old man gets you all of this?
06_13_00_0301     //  But listen, Vito. I'm getting out in a few months. When I do, we'll see what we can do about "adjusting" your sentence.
06_13_00_0310     //  Pepé, come here, have a taste.
06_13_00_0320     //  So Vito, what do you plan on doing when you get out of this shithole?
06_13_00_0330     //  I don't know... I sure as hell ain't gonna go back to working for Clemente, I can tell you that.
06_13_00_0340     //  Yeah, you're better off just forgetting about that old bastard. Trust me, Alberto's a real cocksucker, and you can bet that lawyer he's hired was just there to make sure you didn't rat.
06_13_00_0350     //  But don't worry, he'll get his. Letting guys into your family for money like he offered to you, is against the rules. He's gonna have a lot of explaining to do.
06_25_00_0860     //  Jesus, what the fuck are you made of?
06_25_00_0870     //  You'll have to do better than that, little girl.
06_51_00_0001     //  TIME WELL SPENT
06_51_01_0001     //  Stay in line and obey orders, or you'll get a beating.
06_51_01_0002     //  Obey the guards and proceed down the corridor.
06_51_01_0003     //  Follow the guard.
06_51_01_0004     //  Contact Leo Galante.
06_51_01_0005     //  Teach O'Neill not to mess with you.
06_51_01_0006     //  Talk to Galante.
06_51_01_0007     //  Fight Pepé!
06_51_01_0008     //  Perform a successful counterattack.
06_51_01_0009     //  Get to know the other guys or leave the gym.
06_51_01_0010     //  Defeat your opponent.
06_51_01_0011     //  Follow Galante's man.
06_51_01_0012     //  Enter the laundry room and prepare for a fight.
06_51_01_0013     //  Beat up your opponent.
06_51_01_0014     //  Clean the two dirty urinals.
06_51_01_0015     //  Go take a shower.
06_51_01_0016     //  Defend yourself.
06_51_01_0017     //  Settle the score with O'Neill.
06_51_01_0018     //  Use the bed in your cell.
06_51_01_0019     //  Follow the guard.
06_51_01_0020     //  Follow the guard.
06_51_01_0021     //  Follow the guard.
06_51_01_0022     //  Go to the guard. You have a visitor waiting for you.
06_51_01_0023     //  Practice counterattacks with Pepé.
06_51_01_0024     //  Perform a successful finishing move.
06_51_01_0025     //  Enter the ring.
06_51_01_0028     //  Defeat your opponent.
06_51_01_0029     //  Practice throwing.
06_52_00_0001     //  Leo Galante is the old guy playing chess.
06_52_00_0002     //  To make your opponent angry, press [CATCH] to taunt him.
06_52_00_0003     //  Press [HIT_2] to grab a stunned opponent.
06_52_00_0004     //  Press [HIT_1][HIT_1][HIT_1] at the right pace for finishing combo.
06_52_00_0005     //  You can practice close combat as long as you stay inside the square.
06_52_00_0006     //  To counterattack, evade the opponent's hit by holding [BLOCK] and then quickly press [HIT_1] or [HIT_2].
06_52_00_0007     //  To evade an opponent's attack hold [BLOCK].
06_52_00_0008     //  Leave the gym.
06_58_00_0001     //  Cockroach from garbage can
06_58_00_0002     //  Cockroach from kitchen

06_58_00_0005     //  Confirm
06_58_00_0006     //  Leave the gym and go to sleep?
06_58_00_0007     //  Do you want to continue practicing?
06_58_00_0008     //  Do you want to practice fighting right now?
06_58_00_0009     //  Do you want to fight?
07_01_00_0001     //  Galante wasn't lying. He called in a few favors and arranged for me to get out early. Knocked almost four years off my sentence.
07_01_00_0002     //  Now, Joe used to come visit me and, you know, kind of fill me in on what was happening on the outside, but I tell you as soon as I walked out of that prison gate, it was like a whole new world.
07_01_00_0010     //  Vito!
07_01_00_0011     //  'Ey!
07_01_00_0020     //  Hey, you break out of jail? Ah jeez, it's good to see you in regular clothes - and on the right side of the bars again! Welcome home! Come on in, come in, come in....
07_01_00_0040     //  Man, I tell you. A lot has changed since I went away.
07_01_00_0050     //  Yeah, I guess it has. And hey, it ain't much, but I hooked you up with a nice little apartment, just like you said.
07_01_00_0060     //  Thanks.
07_01_00_0070     //  Now I got a surprise for you. We're going out tonight to celebrate and I'm going to introduce you to somebody.
07_01_00_0080     //  Eh, sounds good to me.
07_01_00_0090     //  You're gonna need a little cash 'til you can get things going again.
07_01_00_0095     //  I got a piece for you too if you want it. Ah, here. Always comes in handy. So uh, what do you want to do now that you're a free man?
07_01_00_0100     //  Hey, what do you think? I want to go to back to working with you again.
07_01_00_0110     //  Alright! I was worried they might have turned you straight in there. Hahahaha...
07_01_00_0120     //  Nah, I actually met a lot of people and learned a lot while I was on the inside. Got a much better idea of how things work now.
07_01_00_0130     //  Good thing, because I wasn't exactly sitting around on my ass while you was in there. Don't worry, though. I'll show you the ropes, like always.
07_01_00_0140     //  Alright, what are we waiting for? Let's go.
07_01_00_0150     //  Jesus, I didn't expect you to be raring to go like this! But, what the hell. C'mon. Let's go see your new place.
07_01_00_0270     //  Yeah?
07_01_00_0280     //  Uh...
07_01_00_0290     //  Look, whatever you're selling pal, I ain't interested...
07_01_00_0300     //  Nonononono, my name's Vito Scaletta... I'm looking for-
07_01_00_0310     //  Oh, right, Francesca's brother. She told me you were in jail.
07_01_00_0320     //  I'm out now. And you are?
07_01_00_0330     //  Francesca's husband, Eric.
07_01_00_0340     //  Your sister ain't here. She uh, must be out shopping or something.
07_01_00_0350     //  I'll uh, tell her you stopped by. See you.
07_01_00_0360     //  Yeah, um...
07_01_00_0370     //  If that guy wasn't married to my sister, Madonna...
07_03_00_0010     //  Jeez, I thought you was going to be a no-show.
07_03_00_0020     //  Not bad, nice material...
07_03_00_0030     //  Thanks. So, uh, what's the plan for tonight?
07_03_00_0040     //  You'll find out. A friend of mine's coming to pick us up. I met him when you was on your little vacation. Hey, show him some respect, he's kind of an important guy.
07_03_00_0050     //  Oh yeah?
07_03_00_0060     //  You'll see in a minute. Here he comes.
07_03_00_0070     //  Hey, Joe! Here I am!
07_03_00_0080     //  Hey, Eddie! How is it going?
07_03_00_0090     //  Not too bad, not too bad. What, this your buddy?
07_03_00_0100     //  Yeah. This is my pal Vito. Vito, this here is a good friend of mine, Eddie Scarpa.
07_03_00_0110     //  Nice to meet you, Eddie.
07_03_00_0120     //  Same here, Vito. OK, fellas, I'm dying for a drink, let's go!
07_04_00_0110     //  Yeah, we heard Alberto and that asshole Luca were taking guys into the family for a fee, but we had no idea they were charging that much. They gonna have to answer for their sins soon.
07_04_00_0120     //  So I talked to Leo Galante about you, Vito. He said you were a real standup guy, and he told me all about the shit that Clemente tried to pull on you guys.
07_04_00_0125     //  But between you and me, why'd you get into that line of work, eh? I mean, we all got our reasons...
07_04_00_0130     //  Well, uh, because, uh, you know, I don't want to end up like my old man. And uh...
07_04_00_0131     //  Look, I figure nobody's gonna help me, so I gotta help myself.
07_04_00_0140     //  O-ok? Yeah... OK, scram baby...
07_04_00_0150     //  So Vito, listen... I work for Carlo Falcone, and, uh, we're looking to expand our operation.
07_04_00_0151     //  Joe's been working for us for a while now, and, uh... since you're a friend of his, we'd like to extend that offer to you as well. What do you say?
07_04_00_0170     //  Yeah, sure I'm interested!
07_04_00_0180     //  Alright! Let's drink to it!
07_04_00_0185     //  Alright.
07_04_00_0190     //  Here's to you guys.
07_04_00_0191     //  And to a bright future together.
07_04_00_0195     //  Cento anni!
07_04_00_0200     //  I can't be drinking too much tonight, I got some business to take care of.
07_04_00_0240     //  Hahahahahahaha. Shit.
07_04_00_0241     //  Hahahahahahaha.
07_04_00_0300     //  No ha ha ha ha .
07_04_00_0315     //  Hahahahahahaha.
07_04_00_0340     //  If you wanna cut out gambling, there's just two things you need to do - burn the stables and shoot the horses. Hahahaha, boy, Frank's a real class act and you know what the best thing was - one of the senators on the committee lost all his money betting on the ponies.
07_04_00_0360     //  Hahahahaha, talk about the horse's ass. Hahaha!
07_04_00_0370     //  No, no... Really! Carlo's a real smart guy, he's into, uh... you know, astrology!
07_04_00_0380     //  You mean astronomy?
07_04_00_0390     //  Yeah, yeah, that's what I just said, the moon, the stars, shit like that. You know what - what are you, fucking deaf?!
07_04_00_0400     //  He sponsors the observatory and spends just about every night up there. I don't get what's so fucking interesting about it, though... Little white specks in the fucking sky...
07_04_00_0614     //  Hahahahaha.
07_04_00_0616     //  Hahahahaha.
07_04_00_0620     //  Yeah, let's go! Hey, get up, Joe!
07_04_00_0621     //  
07_04_00_0650     //  I'm going home... Good night, you whores!
07_04_00_0671     //  Yeah, yeah.
07_04_00_0672     //  Hmmm.
07_04_00_0673     //  Oh no!
07_04_00_0674     //  Yeah.
07_04_00_0675     //  Hmmm, you do.
07_04_00_0676     //  Burp.
07_04_00_0687     //  Hmmm, hmph.
07_04_00_0690     //  Hmmmm, hey, ho.
07_04_00_0693     //  Hehehehehehehe.
07_04_00_0702     //  n_
07_04_00_0710     //  Is that the only word you know how to say?
07_04_00_0720     //  Fuck you, you fucking cumdumpster!
07_04_00_0721     //  Hahahahahahaha!
07_04_00_0722     //  Excuse me? Fuck you, fucking cocksucker! You fucking prick, fuck you!
07_04_00_0723     //  Ah fuck you, you fucking cumdumpster.
07_04_00_0730     //  Sorry, ladies, looks like I gotta get going...
07_04_00_0760     //  You shut your goddamn pie hole! If you want to use your mouth...
07_04_00_0770     //  Oh!
07_04_00_0780     //  Vito!
07_04_00_0790     //  You fellas ready to go?
07_04_00_0791     //  n_
07_04_00_0801     //  No, OK, I'd like that.
07_04_00_0802     //  No, stop.
07_04_00_0805     //  No, no, no, no, no.
07_04_00_0815     //  No!
07_04_00_0816     //  n_
07_05_00_0480     //  Vito, go pop the trunk.
07_05_00_0481     //  Hehehehee...
07_05_00_0482     //  n_...
07_05_00_0483     //  That's great, that's just great. Uhhh ...
07_05_00_0484     //  Is that a joke?

07_05_00_0492     //  All right, we're here.
07_05_00_0495     //  Ah, just a couple days...
07_05_00_0500     //  You're going to have to get him out of there, Vito.
07_05_00_0501     //  I can't handle the smell.
07_05_00_0509     //  Ah, that's just great!

07_05_00_0523     //  Urggh... finally... madonna.
07_05_00_0540     //  OK, now who's gonna bury him?
07_05_00_0550     //  Hey, give me a minute to get a hold of myself... Can you just do it?
07_05_00_0551     //  Every time I get a whiff of the guy, it makes me have to puke. And Eddie's not going to be any help either. He-
07_05_00_0560     //  What?
07_05_00_0570     //  Argh, fine, whatever...
07_05_00_0571     //  Hey, fellas! How about a little music, eh?
07_05_00_0572     //  You gotta be kidding me...
07_05_00_0573     //  God dammit ... new shoes.
07_05_00_0574     //  Jesus Christ, uh..
07_05_00_0575     //  Good night, sweetheart, well it's time to go. Da dada da da! Good night, sweetheart, well... it's time... to... fuck.
07_05_00_0620     //  This wasn't supposed to be part of your homecoming party, but it's nice out here, ain't it? I ain't been in the woods for a while...
07_05_00_0630     //  Yeah, you won't be liking it so damn much after I smack you with this shovel!
07_06_00_0690     //  Sorry Vito, not exactly the best way to end the night, huh? But thanks, I owe you one, big time. Leave Eddie's car here so he can get home in the morning.
07_06_00_0700     //  You're a good man, Vito. I'll settle up with you tomorrow. Hey, you coming in for some drinks?
07_06_00_0701     //  Come on, we'll call some girls, we'll get, you know...
07_06_00_0702     //  It's three in the morning. Shut the hell up.
07_06_00_0703     //  Aaaa, shut up, you whore.
07_06_00_0710     //  You had enough, Eddie. You're going to bed. Come on. I'll call you tomorrow, Vito. Goodnight.
07_51_00_0001     //  IN LOVING MEMORY OF FRANCESCO POTENZA
07_51_01_0001     //  Catch up with Joe.

07_51_01_0012     //  Go get your friends!
07_52_00_0001     //  You are a free man. You should catch up with your old friends.

08_01_00_0411     //  Hey, Vito, rise and shine!
08_01_00_0420     //  Jesus!
08_01_00_0421     //  Marty, stop fucking yelling, will you? My head's killing me!
08_01_00_0430     //  Uh, hehehehe, sorry, Joey.

08_02_00_0020     //  You buying or just window shopping?
08_02_00_0030     //  Maybe.
08_02_00_0040     //  We're selling smokes. Two bucks a carton, a hundred bucks a crate.
08_02_00_0050     //  Heh. I'll make you a deal. You fork over ten cartons, and maybe we'll let you and your buddy get out of here in one piece.
08_02_00_0060     //  Hey, look pal, how about you get back in your cute little car with your little friends there, and I'll pretend I've never seen you. Sound good?
08_02_00_0070     //  Heh. You don't get it, do you, you fat motherfucker? This is our turf. And it's gonna cost you to operate here. Now pay up!
08_02_00_0080     //  You're the one who doesn't get it. You have any idea who you're talking to? One last chance. Walk away now and...
08_02_00_0090     //  Yeah, I'll tell you who I'm talking to. A fat, two-bit fucking dago door-to-door salesman hawking stolen cigarettes on my turf. And it's time to close up shop, asshole.
08_02_00_0100     //  OK, boys, I think it's time for a fire sale!
08_02_00_0110     //  Shit! Joe... ungh! Fuck...
08_02_00_0120     //  Haha. What do you say now, Porky?
08_02_00_0130     //  What do I gotta say?
08_02_00_0135     //  That's what I gotta say.
08_02_00_0140     //  Anybody else think I owe 'em money?!
08_02_00_0160     //  Holy shit, Joe...
08_02_00_0190     //  Come on, hop in that car and let's go.
08_03_00_0010     //  Hey, Steve.

08_03_00_0030     //  Hey, guys...
08_03_00_0040     //  Marty?! What are you doing here?
08_03_00_0050     //  Hey, Joe! I'm going with you on this one! Steve needed help, he said I could come along!
08_03_00_0060     //  Steve, uh, isn't this uh...
08_03_00_0070     //  Eh. Kid's gotta learn sometime...
08_03_00_0080     //  OK, why are we here, Steve, huh? The guys we're looking for are all headed to the foundry.
08_03_00_0090     //  This is where they usually meet, so we'll start here, then head over to the foundry to finish the job.
08_03_00_0100     //  And, uh, why'd you volunteer to help us?
08_03_00_0110     //  Those bastards trashed my cousin's car.
08_03_00_0111     //  They robbed him and knocked out three of his teeth.
08_03_00_0120     //  Yeah, those fucking assholes, they make problems all over the city. Well, just the other day...
08_03_00_0130     //  Shut up, kid! I'm talking here. So like the Bible says - an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. And well, we'll just start with this joint.
08_03_00_0140     //  So what's the plan?
08_03_00_0150     //  First we're gonna trash this place.
08_03_00_0160     //  And how we gonna do that?
08_03_00_0170     //  With this!
08_03_00_0180     //  Go ahead, boys!
08_03_00_0185     //  Hey, c'mon, guys!
08_03_00_0186     //  Hehe...  Let's go teach these fuckers a lesson! Hehe... hehe...
08_03_00_0190     //  Now, you can either help us, or stay out of our way.
08_03_00_0200     //  What the fuck was that?
08_04_00_0030     //  Hey, how'd you get in here?!
08_04_00_0040     //  We followed the fucking yellow brick road.
08_04_00_0050     //  Next!
08_04_00_0055     //  Heh, nice one.
08_04_00_0060     //  You fuckers are dead!
08_04_00_0070     //  Joe, watch out!
08_04_00_0080     //  Thanks, kid.
08_04_00_0090     //  Shit, they got guns! Let 'em have it!
08_05_00_0030     //  Listen, this got way out of hand. Eddie's not gonna be too happy.
08_05_00_0040     //  Eddie'll be fine. What were we going to do, just let 'em kill us? These fucking dirtbags won't be bothering nobody no more.
08_05_00_0050     //  What now, Steve?
08_05_00_0060     //  Now I'm gonna go home and see if that castor oil's working. I been blocked up for weeks. I'll see you's later.
08_05_00_0070     //  Enjoy. Joe and I still got a lot of work to do. We'll catch you later.
08_08_00_0010     //  So?
08_08_00_0020     //  Here's the money.
08_08_00_0030     //  Well, that's a fucking relief. Stupid fucking junkies! Now they know their place... Good work boys, here's your cut.
08_08_00_0040     //  Thanks, Eddie. So you need anything else from us today or is that it? I got something I gotta take care of...
08_08_00_0050     //  No, no, no, that's all for today. I'll call you if I need anything.
08_50_00_0140     //  What now?
08_50_00_0150     //  Now we take care of our customers. These guys here buy in bulk from us. Come with me.

09_01_00_0021     //  Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Falcone.
09_01_00_0022     //  Vito.
09_01_00_0030     //  So Vito, how do you feel about Alberto Clemente and Luca Gurino?
09_01_00_0040     //  Well, honestly, Mr. Falcone, the way I see it, those assholes tried to steal five thousand bucks from me and then left me to rot in jail.
09_01_00_0050     //  That's good. Because the two of them are planning to make a move on us.
09_01_00_0051     //  So it looks like we're going to have to do something before they do something. Eddie will tell you the rest. I'm sure you won't let me down.
09_01_00_0060     //  Goodbye, Mr. Falcone.
09_01_00_0061     //  Nice to meet you, Vito.
09_01_00_0070     //  So what the hell's going on?
09_01_00_0080     //  A car with three of our guys in it disappeared last night, and word around town is that Luca might've had something to do with it.
09_01_00_0081     //  Who's missing?
09_01_00_0082     //  Harvey Beans and the two guys who were supposed to be protecting him...
09_01_00_0083     //  What do you need me to do?
09_01_00_0084     //  I need you to wait for him in front of Freddy's and follow him to find out if he's involved.
09_01_00_0085     //  Tony Balls and Frankie the Mick. Beans is Carlo's accountant.
09_01_00_0086     //  If he talks, we're all fucked.
09_01_00_0090     //  And then?
09_01_00_0100     //  If you find out that he had anything to do with this, you whack the bastard.
09_01_00_0101     //  And if any of our guys are still alive, try and rescue 'em. Hopefully you can find them before they spill the beans about our operation.
09_01_00_0110     //  Where do you think he'll go?
09_01_00_0120     //  I got no idea. So go prepared. Make sure you got a fast car and some firepower.
09_01_00_0125     //  n_ Hmm.
09_01_00_0126     //  n_ Hm, ya.
09_01_00_0130     //  Alright, no problem.
09_01_00_0140     //  OK. Stop by here when you're done. And Vito, don't tell nobody about this.
09_01_00_0150     //  Got it.
09_02_00_0010     //  Think I don't know about the dope? I know where you got the money! Falcone thinks he's got a good racket going, but he ain't gonna get away with it! C'mon... How'd you get it into the states?
09_02_00_0020     //  I don't know anything, I'm just an accountant!
09_02_00_0030     //  Don't fuck with me, you egghead bastard!
09_02_00_0032     //  You want to end up just like your buddy here? C'mon, take a good look. You think you're tougher than him?
09_02_00_0033     //  After we're done with you's we're gonna grind you up in one of these machines here. It's-it's just a question of whether I am going to be nice enough... to fucking kill you first!
09_02_00_0040     //  Argh... Hey, what's that fucking stench? Argh!...Argh...
09_02_00_0050     //  Hey! Hey, somebody's over there!
09_02_00_0060     //  Drop 'em!
09_02_00_0070     //  Hey, who the fuck are you supposed to be? Jesus Christ... What, what, is Captain Shitbag here to save the day?
09_02_00_0080     //  Shut the fuck up, Luca!
09_02_00_0090     //  Hey, I know you! You're that chump who was hanging around with that moron Barbaro. I thought you was still rotting in the can. What the fuck you think you're doing here?
09_02_00_0100     //  Falcone sent me. He isn't too fond of skinny little cocksuckers trying to turn his guys into mincemeat.
09_02_00_0110     //  So you joined up with Falcone, huh?  Well, I'll tell you what. If you knew what was really going on, you'd realize that you was better off in jail. But that don't matter now, anyway...
09_02_00_0120     //  Boys, take care of him!
09_03_00_0001     //  Ah, fucking... Son of a fucking... What the... Prick!
09_03_00_0002     //  Think he's so fucking smart? Think you so fucking smart, huh? Go ahead! Try! Son of a bitch, what's he doing over there?
09_03_00_0010     //  Aaah - shit!  Aaah, no!  Aaah, God!
09_03_00_0011     //  Leave me alone! Leave me alone, you fucking bastard!... No, wait, no, no! Wait! Aaah...
09_03_00_0012     //  Aaah, ugha aaagh, eeegh...
09_03_00_0020     //  Come here, you fuck!
09_03_00_0021     //  Now I'll show you what it feels like, you no good cocksucking son of a bitch!
09_03_00_0030     //  I'm gonna have a little fun with Luca before I grind him up.  Want to join me?
09_03_00_0040     //  Uhh... Thanks for the invitation, but I think I'll pass on that....
09_03_00_0050     //  Hate the sight of blood, huh?
09_03_00_0060     //  No, just hate the sight of Luca.
09_03_00_0070     //  Hehehe... I hear ya, but you're missing out. I think I'm gonna try out that cattle prod he was yapping about...
09_03_00_0080     //  Uh... yeah... Eddie wanted me to take care of him personally...
09_03_00_0090     //  Don't worry about that. It'll just take a little longer this way. This fuck don't deserve a quick death.
09_03_00_0100     //  I can't argue with that. OK, I'm gonna go. I stink like an outhouse, I gotta get cleaned up.
09_03_00_0110     //  And tell Eddie he don't gotta worry about Luca.
09_03_00_0120     //  Yo, Beans! Open the door, it's all over!
09_03_00_0130     //  You?... You're still alive?
09_03_00_0140     //  Yeah, what'd you expect? Look, before we go home, you want to give me a hand with Sleeping Beauty here?
09_03_00_0150     //  You know, that's not such a bad idea...
09_04_00_0010     //  So anyway, so... I got there a little late, right? And I walk in, no shit... and this girl - I mean she's built like a fucking brick shithouse, right?
09_04_00_0011     //  So she's going down on him and he's going "Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh" - Jesus Christ!  Was that you?
09_04_00_0020     //  Vito? Oh, Jesus Chr...! Why didn't you take a fucking bath before you came back?
09_04_00_0030     //  You told me to come right back when I was done. You think I'm enjoying this?
09_04_00_0040     //  OK OK OK, what happened with Luca?
09_04_00_0050     //  It's done.
09_04_00_0060     //  Alright... How about our guys? You find them?
09_04_00_0070     //  Yeah, Luca had them in the slaughterhouse. Frankie's dead, but Balls and Beans are fine. Luca was, uh, interrogating them when I got there.
09_04_00_0080     //  Any witnesses?
09_04_00_0081     //  Whoa, whoa.
09_04_00_0085     //  Back...back up, ok?
09_04_00_0090     //  Well, except for a dozen or so of Luca's bodyguards we ran into, nobody.
09_04_00_0091     //  It was rough, Eddie.
09_04_00_0100     //  Yeah, it sounds like it got pretty hairy. But hey, you pulled it off and you got out of there in one piece, right? So go get cleaned up before you ruin everybody's appetite.
09_04_00_0101     //  And burn those fucking clothes you're wearing... My God...
09_05_00_0010     //  Hey, Vito. You made it.
09_05_00_0020     //  Oh, nice threads.
09_05_00_0030     //  Hey, Eddie.
09_05_00_0035     //  Thanks. So uh, what's the plan, fellas? What's with the suits?
09_05_00_0040     //  Vito! Mr. Falcone is going to bring us into the family tonight! You and me! We're gonna be made!
09_05_00_0050     //  No shit! Tonight?!
09_05_00_0060     //  Yeah!
09_05_00_0070     //  Really? Why didn't you tell me before? What do we gotta do?
09_05_00_0080     //  You'll find out. But first, there's somebody who'd like to have a little word with you.
09_05_00_0090     //  Leo! Good to see you! What are you doing here?
09_05_00_0110     //  Hehehehe... Hey, kiddo. I want to talk to you about what's gonna happen today. Come here, have a seat.
09_05_00_0120     //  Alright... Sure. And hey, thanks again for doing whatever you did to get me out of the can early.
09_05_00_0130     //  And now I've made good on my second promise to you.
09_05_00_0140     //  Second promise?
09_05_00_0150     //  Yeah, I told you the next time we open the books, we'd recommend you, didn't I? And now it's done.
09_05_00_0160     //  You had something to do with this? But you work for Frank Vinci...
09_05_00_0170     //  Yeah, I would've liked to have had you in our family, but I figure Joe there's your best friend...
09_05_00_0180     //  ...you guys grew up together, just like me and Frank. And since Joe was working for Carlo the whole time you were inside, I recommended they take you in too when he got made.
09_05_00_0190     //  Thanks, Leo. I... I don't know what to say...
09_05_00_0200     //  You don't gotta say nothing. Not to me or anybody else. That's kind of the way this whole thing works, Vito.
09_05_00_0210     //  Hahaha... Yeah.
09_05_00_0220     //  Now come on. We don't want to keep 'em waiting.
09_05_00_0230     //  Alright, I'll see you fellas upstairs.
09_05_00_0250     //  What was that all about?
09_05_00_0260     //  Ahhh nothing, just... you know, talking about old times.
09_05_00_0270     //  Like that time when old Leo dropped the soap?
09_05_00_0280     //  Fuck you!
09_05_00_0290     //  Alright, alright, alright that's enough. Let's go.
09_05_00_0300     //  You's are like two school kids, I swear to God.
09_05_00_0310     //  Alright, wait here. Now listen to me, fellas, it's one at a time. Once you're inside, just do as you're told, ok?
09_05_00_0320     //  Joe, come on in.
09_05_00_0330     //  Hey, good luck.
09_05_00_0340     //  Alright, your turn, Vito.
09_05_00_0350     //  Gentlemen, this is Vito Scaletta.
09_05_00_0370     //  Vito, know that this family of ours is a secret. You are entering the society of the chosen. A society which does not exist to the rest of the world.
09_05_00_0371     //  Our family means more to you from now on than your own family, or God, or your country. If I ask you to kill your own brother, you must do it. Show me, which finger would pull the trigger?
09_05_00_0390     //  Repeat after me, Vito: If I were to betray the secret of our way of life...
09_05_00_0400     //  If I were to betray the secret of our way of life...
09_05_00_0410     //  ...May my soul burn in hell, just like this saint.
09_05_00_0420     //  ...May my soul burn in hell, just like this saint.
09_05_00_0430     //  Amico nostra.
09_05_00_0440     //  Gentlemen, I give you our new friend, Vito Scaletta.
09_05_00_0450     //  I am very pleased to have these two talented and honest men join us.
09_05_00_0451     //  And I'm happy this has happened in the presence of our esteemed guests, especially Don Frank Vinci.
09_05_00_0455     //  n_ And as consigliere, a wise man Leo Galante... the same applies if you as much as touch the wife of another member.
09_05_00_0456     //  You'll recieve payments for your services from Eddie. Would you like to add anything, Frank?
09_05_00_0460     //  Whatever you do, gentlemen, stay away from the dope! No dope! That's our policy.
09_05_00_0461     //  You can make plenty of money, but it's a filthy business...
09_05_00_0462     //  n_ and poses too many risks. Loansharking, cathouses, protection, bookmaking...
09_05_00_0470     //  You might wonder why I'd take this risk again after spending almost seven years in the can.
09_05_00_0471     //  You see, where I grew up, the only guys who mattered were the guys who had the balls to take what they wanted.
09_05_00_0480     //  And after years of doing everybody else's dirty work, I was willing to risk anything to finally be somebody.
09_50_00_0010     //  Now where are you, Luca?
09_50_00_0020     //  There you are!
09_50_00_0021     //  OK, here we go.
09_50_00_0030     //  This is Luca's car...
09_51_00_0001     //  BALLS AND BEANS
09_51_01_0001     //  Head to the Maltese Falcon to see Eddie.
09_51_01_0002     //  Wait for Luca outside Freddy's.
09_51_01_0003     //  Follow Luca. Don't let him see you.
09_51_01_0004     //  Find a way to sneak into the slaughterhouse.
09_51_01_0005     //  Don't get seen or Falcone's guys will be killed.
09_51_01_0006     //  Save your guys! Find out where they're being held.
09_51_01_0007     //  Find Luca.
09_51_01_0008     //  Fight them off. Keep your guys alive.
09_51_01_0009     //  Get Luca.
09_51_01_0010     //  Find something to weigh the cart down.
09_51_01_0011     //  Go see Eddie at the Falcon.
09_51_01_0012     //  You smell like shit. Change your clothes.
09_51_01_0013     //  Go back to the Falcon.
09_51_01_0014     //  Drive to Millville and trash the car shipment.
09_51_01_0015     //  The next 3 months
09_51_01_0016     //  Luca has been killed.
09_51_01_0017     //  You lost Luca.
09_51_01_0018     //  You damaged Luca's car.
09_51_01_0019     //  Luca didn't reach his destination.
09_52_00_0001     //  Find the key.
09_52_00_0002     //  Take cover!
09_52_00_0003     //  You're getting too close!
09_52_00_0004     //  Luca is getting away. Step on it!
09_52_00_0005     //  Get back to the slaughterhouse! The job isn't finished!
09_52_00_0006     //  Change your clothes at a clothing store or at your apartment.
09_52_00_0007     //  The sewer looks like a way into the slaughterhouse.
09_52_00_0008     //  Do not shoot or your guys will be killed.
09_52_00_0009     //  Steal Harry's car from the police station and drive it back to Harry's.
09_52_00_0010     //  Take Harry's car.
09_52_00_0011     //  Take the car back to Harry's gunshop.
09_52_00_0012     //  Grab a car.
09_52_00_0013     //  Grab a different car.
09_52_00_0014     //  Someone found a dead body.
09_58_00_0001     //  Take the key
09_58_00_0002     //  Unlock the handcuffs
10_01_00_0002     //  I went at 'em with a baseball bat and they looked like they was scared 'til yesterday.
10_01_00_0010     //  Morning, fellas.
10_01_00_0020     //  Oh, hey, good mornin', Vito!
10_01_00_0030     //  Marty? What are you doing here?
10_01_00_0040     //  Joe said you needed help, and since I did good with the greasers, he said he'd take me along again.
10_01_00_0041     //  Yeah, well ah, I - I'll talk to you later...heh.
10_01_00_0042     //  Yeah, that's my man Vito.
10_01_00_0050     //  Take you along again, for what exactly?
10_01_00_0060     //  They're waiting for ya...
10_01_00_0070     //  Morning, Mr. Falcone.
10_01_00_0071     //  Hey, guys.
10_01_00_0080     //  Hiya, Vito. Take a seat.
10_01_00_0090     //  Ugh... So what's happening?
10_01_00_0100     //  I heard how you got rid of Luca, Vito. Good job. Thanks to you we now have proof that Clemente was behind the attack on our guys. We couldn't do anything to him openly 'til now.
10_01_00_0101     //  He just cut his own throat, he kidnapped and tortured our guys and that means war.
10_01_00_0102     //  Anything we do now, I'm gonna be able to justify before The Commission. Alberto knows this, so he's gonna act quickly and try and come after us first.
10_01_00_0110     //  So we're gonna take out Clemente...
10_01_00_0120     //  Exactly. Turns out Clemente called a big meeting in the Empire Arms Hotel today. This is our best chance to get rid of him and his top guys.
10_01_00_0130     //  Oh, sure, yeah. We'll just waltz right in there and kill a few dozen heavily armed men, in broad daylight, in the nicest hotel in town. Is that about right?
10_01_00_0140     //  Don't worry. I got a plan.
10_01_00_0150     //  Shit! Joe. Put that thing away!
10_01_00_0160     //  Eddie, don't worry, it's safe. I just gotta press this...
10_01_00_0170     //  For Chrissakes, put it away now! What's the matter with you?
10_01_00_0180     //  OK, OK. You're such a chickenshit.
10_01_00_0190     //  OK, OK, so now we're gonna waltz right in and blow up the nicest hotel in town. Isn't that overkill?
10_01_00_0200     //  Don't worry. This thing ain't that powerful. It won't blow up the whole building, but everybody in the room where it goes off... is dead meat.
10_01_00_0210     //  How are we gonna know when to detonate it?
10_01_00_0220     //  We'll use a window washing platform. We'll almost be able to watch it explode.
10_01_00_0230     //  Since when are you the smart one?
10_01_00_0240     //  OK, fellas, I'm counting on you.
10_01_00_0241     //  If all goes well, I'll have something nice for you. When it's over, call Eddie at this number.
10_01_00_0250     //  Oh, by the way, I closed the bar today, just in case Alberto tried something.
10_01_00_0260     //  Hey, good luck, fellas.
10_01_00_0280     //  Hey, what about that kid in the hallway?
10_01_00_0290     //  You mean Marty? Uh, he ain't part of the organization so he had to wait outside.
10_01_00_0300     //  I mean... why is he here at all?
10_01_00_0310     //  Why do you think? He's going with us because we need a getaway driver and somebody to cover our asses.
10_01_00_0311     //  What do you got against him anyway? I known him since he was a little kid, and he saved my ass with them greasers.
10_01_00_0320     //  Yeah, but we're not fighting a bunch of drunk dirtbags this time! We're about to take out the most powerful family in this city, and you're bringing a kid!
10_01_00_0330     //  And how old were you when you started doing this shit? You're talking like you're some old fart.
10_01_00_0331     //  Look, Vito, he's gonna wait in the car outside and drive us away. That's it. He ain't even gonna know what we're doing there. He's a great driver and that's exactly what we need on this one.
10_01_00_0340     //  OK, Joe, whatever. But I'm telling you right now. This is a bad idea.
10_02_00_0010     //  Alright, Vito and me'll go in and do what needs to be done. You wait for us here. When you hear a big boom, start the car up 'cause we're gonna need to get the hell out of here pronto.
10_02_00_0011     //  And you won't need that gun unless somebody follows us, but that shouldn't happen.
10_02_00_0020     //  OK, OK, I got you, Joe.
10_02_00_0030     //  Clemente rented the entire 18th floor, the third one from the top. There's a couple of suites and conference rooms up there - and guards.
10_02_00_0040     //  So how we gonna get up there?
10_02_00_0050     //  Round the back through the laundry room.
10_02_00_0060     //  What, you want to wash your shorts before we do this?
10_02_00_0070     //  Wiseass. The meeting hasn't started yet.
10_02_00_0071     //  n_ singing ta da da da
10_02_00_0072     //  We'll grab some hotel worker uniforms, then we'll go do a little "cleaning" upstairs.
10_02_00_0080     //  Seriously - when did you become the smart one?
10_02_00_0090     //  Fuck off. There's supposed to be a guy waiting for us inside with the uniforms. Let's go.
10_02_00_0091     //  And we don't want to make a ruckus before Clemente gets here, so don't go doing nothing stupid.
10_02_00_0100     //  Haha. Shouldn't I be telling you that?
10_02_00_0110     //  Stay here.
10_02_00_0120     //  Aah ... Always the fucking bridesmaid.
10_02_00_0140     //  Let's go, move it!
10_02_00_0150     //  n_Ugh... uh...
10_02_00_0160     //  n_aarh ...ooph...
10_02_00_0170     //  Hey Richie, come with us.
10_02_00_0180     //  Hey you two. You got some more work upstairs waiting for you. Get moving.
10_02_00_0190     //  That was fucking Henry!
10_02_00_0191     //  Yeah.
10_02_00_0200     //  Vito, one more thing... here, put this on.
10_02_00_0210     //  Are you fucking serious?
10_02_00_0220     //  So nobody recognizes us, just put it on!
10_02_00_0230     //  Great.
10_02_00_9050     //  Oh shit.... Oh fuck... the yellow...
10_02_00_9051     //  .. The blue... the plus into plus..
10_02_00_9052     //  ... the red... and match in...
10_02_00_9053     //  ... negative... oh... the blue...  and cross... perfect!
10_02_00_9060     //  Ok. The hard part is almost over.
10_02_00_9070     //  Eh.
10_03_00_0010     //  Vito... Vito! Hold on, I forgot something.
10_03_00_0020     //  Ah, shit... What?
10_03_00_0030     //  Here, this is for you. Just in case something goes wrong.
10_03_00_0045     //  Some piece of work, huh? 1911 Cole with a modified clip.
10_03_00_0046     //  Where the hell did you uh ...
10_03_00_0047     //  Holds twenty-three bullets, so the ammo goes quick. And don't go losing it. These are the only two in the whole world.
10_03_00_0050     //  This is nice!
10_03_00_0051     //  Thanks.
10_03_00_0060     //  Nevermind. We gotta go to the window washing platform, c'mon.
10_03_00_0070     //  Shit!
10_03_00_0080     //  Fuck!
10_03_00_0090     //  Clemente's guys.
10_03_00_0095     //  Ah, fuck me. Alright, let's get outta here.
10_03_00_0101     //  n_ ... both of you. That was a fucking beaut. What are you looking at? God, calm down or I'll give you a fucking smack you half'a fag.
10_03_00_0102     //  n_ Hahaha.
10_03_00_0103     //  Oh, this is like an oyster, hold on, hold on, check it out.
10_04_00_0010     //  Ahh... That's it. OK, got it. Take us up a bit.
10_04_00_0011     //  Ahh... Yeah, just like clockwork. Hehehe. Ah, here we go.
10_04_00_0020     //  These assholes ain't gonna kno...
10_04_00_0021     //  Jesus, fuck... Uoooh... Oh my God, what the fuck is it?
10_04_00_0022     //  Uoooh...
10_04_00_0030     //  Payback's a bitch.
10_04_00_0033     //  What the hell was that?
10_04_00_0034     //  I don't know... The thing just blew.
10_04_00_0035     //  We'll barely feel it, right?
10_04_00_0036     //  I don't know why I fucking listen to you. I swear you're like a half a retard sometimes.
10_04_00_0040     //  Alright, alright. Lets go take a look.
10_04_00_0050     //  Shit.
10_04_00_0051     //  What a fucking mess.
10_04_00_0060     //  Ugh! What the... Jesus Christ,  I almost pissed on my fucking shoes in here!
10_04_00_0061     //  Felt like a fucking earthquake. What the fuck!
10_04_00_0070     //  Oh, shit!
10_04_00_0080     //  You assholes. You're gonna die for this!
10_04_00_0090     //  Lucky bastard...
10_04_00_0095     //  Fuck, we can't let him get away! Come on, Vito!
10_05_00_0010     //  Quick, sir!
10_06_00_0010     //  Shit! Marty! C'mon, Vito, he's all by himself! We gotta help him!
10_07_00_0001     //  n_(panting)
10_07_00_0002     //  n_(panting)
10_07_00_0010     //  Marty! No! No!
10_07_00_0020     //  Fuck! They shot him! He's dead, Vito! Motherfuckers!
10_07_00_0040     //  Alright, Joe... Joe, come on, we got to get out of here! You can't help him now.
10_07_00_0041     //  Clemente's getting away!
10_07_00_0050     //  I'm sorry, Marty.
10_07_00_0051     //  Let's go! I'm gonna kill that fuck!
10_08_00_0010     //  Fuck!
10_09_00_0010     //  That's the end of him.
10_09_00_0020     //  Can't be sure unless we check.
10_09_00_0030     //  This is for Marty.
10_09_00_0040     //  Now it's over.
10_09_00_0050     //  Let's go to my place.
10_10_00_0005     //  Eh, you wanna beer? Eh?
10_10_00_0010     //  Give me Eddie's number. I'll call him.
10_10_00_0020     //  Hello?
10_10_00_0030     //  This is Joe. It's done.
10_10_00_0040     //  Everything went smooth?
10_10_00_0050     //  No. It didn't.
10_10_00_0060     //  Why?
10_10_00_0070     //  Marty's dead.
10_10_00_0080     //  What?
10_10_00_0090     //  They got Marty, we left him there!
10_10_00_0100     //  Uh, OK-OK - what about Clemente?
10_10_00_0110     //  Done.
10_10_00_0120     //  Alright! Hey, don't worry about the kid, small price to pay. The main thing is it's done.
10_10_00_0130     //  S... sm... small price!? That's my fucking friend you're talking about!
10_10_00_0135     //  Calm down now, Joe. Joe, take it easy.
10_10_00_0140     //  Hey, Joe, don't go taking it out on me!
10_10_00_0141     //  It was your idea and nobody forced the kid to go.
10_10_00_0150     //  I'm sorry but shit happens, right? Come by the Falcon tomorrow to get your money.
10_10_00_0160     //  Yeah... whatever.
10_10_00_0170     //  The fuck you're sorry!
10_10_00_0180     //  Alright, take it easy now, alright? Calm down. I'm sorry too. More than you think, but you knew the risks.
10_10_00_0200     //  You too?
10_10_00_0210     //  Hey, this was a dangerous job. You took him along, he died.
10_10_00_0230     //  What - you think the war was any different?
10_10_00_0240     //  And Eddie didn't even know the kid, so don't blame him.
10_10_00_0250     //  You should go home.
10_10_00_0260     //  Ok, well... Just give me a minute to get changed.
10_10_00_0270     //  Eh... I'm sorry kid, I am so sorry.
10_11_00_0303     //  Yeah, yeah, I know, I know...
10_11_00_0305     //  Ehm... Ehm...
10_11_00_0306     //  Heh... Right.
10_11_00_0311     //  Wow, Jesus!
10_11_00_0320     //  Vito, you here!
10_11_00_0330     //  Alright, where is he?
10_11_00_0340     //  Over in the corner there. Now look, I tried to cut him off, but the motherfucker was gonna air my ass out if I did!
10_11_00_0345     //  OK. Lock that door and just give me a minute with him.
10_11_00_0350     //  Had a couple, huh? How you feeling?
10_11_00_0360     //  Vito! About time you showed up. Everybody went home already...
10_11_00_0370     //  Gee, Joe, I wonder why?
10_11_00_0380     //  Oh...
10_11_00_0390     //  You drive here?
10_11_00_0400     //  Na, I took a cab! I wouldn't park my car in this neighborhood.
10_11_00_0404     //  n_ mumbling
10_11_00_0410     //  Alright, finish your drink and let's go.
10_11_00_0420     //  You fellas about to leave? I'll let you out.
10_11_00_0430     //  Shit, now where'd I put my keys?
10_11_00_0440     //  Well, Marty. Here's to you kid. You went out like a man.
10_11_00_0444     //  I'm so sorry, kid.
10_11_00_0445     //  This never should've happened. Never should've happened!
10_11_00_0446     //  Ahh shit...
10_11_00_0450     //  You gotta be kidding me. What... the fuck... is wrong with you?!
10_11_00_0451     //  I was just...
10_11_00_0452     //  You were just what? Shut your fucking mouth, and get your drunk ass outside!
10_11_00_0453     //  Alright... Alright... I'm going...
10_12_00_0475     //  Alright, we're here. Try not to shoot anybody on the way to the front door, huh?
10_12_00_0480     //  Thanks, Vito. And hey, I'm sorry about -
10_12_00_0490     //  Look, just... Call me tomorrow, OK?

10_51_01_0016     //  Mission failed: Clemente got away.

10_52_00_0016     //  You have explosives in the car, so be careful.
10_52_00_0017     //  Drive very carefully. There's a bomb in the car.
10_52_00_0018     //  You gave yourself away.
10_52_00_0019     //  You need to pass the manager.

10_58_00_0002     //  Tell the truth
10_58_00_0003     //  What the fuck are you doing up here?
11_01_00_0010     //  Hey.
11_01_00_0020     //  Hey, Vito.
11_01_00_0030     //  You got that money for me?
11_01_00_0040     //  Always keep my word, don't I? Here you go. Don't spend it all in one place.
11_01_00_0050     //  Thanks. Where's Joe?
11_01_00_0060     //  Uh... He was here before, but then he left. Looked pissed off. Though lately, he always looks pissed off.
11_01_00_0070     //  Yeah. Can you blame him?
11_01_00_0075     //  Listen, uh... I need to talk to you about something.
11_01_00_0080     //  What? Is it important? I'm busy with Vinci right now. He's planning to make a move on us and we don't know how or why. I-I... I gotta sort this shit out.
11_01_00_0090     //  Yeah, well, I think it's worth hearing me out.
11_01_00_0100     //  All right, go ahead. But make it quick.
11_01_00_0110     //  Alright, a guy I know who worked for Clemente called me. He's worried. He's not sure if we'll be going after the rest of Clemente's guys or not.
11_01_00_0120     //  Hehe, oh that's good. As far as I know, the boss ain't planning nothing at this point. Unless they try something stupid.
11_01_00_0130     //  OK. Well this guy also asked me if he could come work for us.
11_01_00_0140     //  Yeah? Who is it? What, is he a friend of yours?
11_01_00_0150     //  I did a few jobs with him for Clemente. Really knows his shit.
11_01_00_0160     //  Yeah...
11_01_00_0170     //  OK. Tell him to stop by.
11_01_00_0180     //  Well, uh... He's here right now.
11_01_00_0190     //  Hahaha, he is? Alright, go get him then...
11_01_00_0200     //  Eddie, this is Henry Tomasino. Henry, this is Eddie Scarpa.
11_01_00_0210     //  Pleased to meet you, Mr. Scarpa.
11_01_00_0220     //  Don't call me Mr. Scarpa. My friends call me Eddie. And take a seat, Henry.
11_01_00_0230     //  So, Vito tells me you want to join up with us.
11_01_00_0240     //  Yeah, I'm out of work right now, and I don't want to make a big deal out of what happened.
11_01_00_0250     //  Now, that's good thinking. Tell me something first, Henry - were Clemente and Vinci planning anything against our organization?
11_01_00_0260     //  OK... I usually keep my nose out of things like that.
11_01_00_0261     //  But I was with Luca Gurino once at Leo Galante's place and Luca was going on and on about Falcone being involved in some dirty business and that something should be done about it.
11_01_00_0262     //  I think he was trying to turn Vinci against you.
11_01_00_0270     //  That bastard! I bet he was talking about drugs all the while he's dealing them himself.
11_01_00_0271     //  He knows that Vinci is totally against this. Yeah, probably fooled the old man good. So that's why he's plannin' to move on us... Now, we gotta hit him first.
11_01_00_0280     //  Again?!
11_01_00_0290     //  Hey, if we don't act, Frank will. First we've got to get rid of Galante. Without him, Frank's fucked.
11_01_00_0300     //  Leo!?
11_01_00_0310     //  I wanted to keep you out of it, but I didn't have anybody else who could pull off a job like this.
11_01_00_0311     //  Now I'm thinking this could be the perfect opportunity for Henry here to prove himself.
11_01_00_0320     //  What do you say, Henry, you up for it?
11_01_00_0330     //  If it means I'm in when the job's done, sure...
11_01_00_0340     //  Exactly! Take care of Leo.
11_01_00_0341     //  And what about you, Vito? I'd feel a lot better if you went with Henry to make sure everything goes smooth.
11_01_00_0342     //  I don't mean you gotta whack the guy. Just drive there, wait until it's done and drive back. But if it don't feel right I can ask somebody else instead. What do you say?
11_01_00_0343     //  Sorry, Eddie. I can't do this. Leo was like a father to me back in the can.
11_01_00_0349     //  Yeah, I understand. Well, looks like you gotta take care of this yourself, Henry. You can hire some help if you want, but you gotta do this so nobody suspects it was us. Leo lives in Highbrook.
11_01_00_0350     //  Got it. Don't worry. It'll be done today.
11_01_00_0360     //  OK, you better get going then.
11_01_00_0370     //  See you later, Eddie.
11_01_00_0380     //  It's a good thing you brought him here. Even if he screws up, nobody will know it was us.
11_01_00_0390     //  I don't think Henry's gonna screw it up.
11_01_00_0400     //  That's good. Well, Vito, I got nothing else for you today, but, uh, drop by tomorrow, OK?
11_01_00_0410     //  Yeah. I'll see you later, Eddie.
11_01_00_0415     //  See you.
11_03_00_0010     //  Leo! Leo, you here?!
11_03_00_0020     //  How the hell did you get in here!? Get out of here or I'll shove this gun up your ass!
11_03_00_0030     //  Leo, Leo, put it away. It's me, Vito!
11_03_00_0040     //  Vito? What the hell are you doing here? You could have called first...
11_03_00_0050     //  Leo, there's no time to talk, you gotta get out of here quick, they're after you!
11_03_00_0060     //  What? Come upstairs, Vito, my feet are getting cold. Want a drink?
11_03_00_0065     //  Do I want a drink? What the fuck is wrong with you?
11_03_00_0070     //  OK, so what's happening?
11_03_00_0080     //  Look, Falcone wants you dead. The guys are on their way.  You gotta get out of here!
11_03_00_0090     //  What? Why the hell would I do that?
11_03_00_0100     //  Look, Falcone heard Vinci's planning to make a move on him, because Clemente lied and said that he was in the dope business.
11_03_00_0110     //  Lied?! Vito, Carlo Falcone is in the dope business! Everybody knows that.
11_03_00_0111     //  Clemente tried to muscle his way into the business, so Falcone got rid of him. Now he wants to get rid of us too... Before we make a move on him.
11_03_00_0120     //  How do you know all this?
11_03_00_0130     //  I got my sources. Why did you come here again?
11_03_00_0140     //  Why?! What, are you getting senile on me? Because they're going to kill you! Stop talking for Chrissake, get dressed and let's go.
11_03_00_0150     //  Why don't we just get rid of whoever Carlo sent to whack me? We got the advantage. They don't know we're expecting them.
11_03_00_0160     //  I can't do that. I know the guy... I'm actually the one who got him the job.
11_03_00_0170     //  What? You hired your friend to whack me?
11_03_00_0180     //  No, not exactly. Look I don't have time to explain. He's gonna be here any minute!
11_03_00_0190     //  OK. Wait here, I'll get dressed.
11_03_00_0200     //  Shit, too late, they're here.
11_03_00_0210     //  Oh, shit... Henry can't see me here! We gotta hide - quick, before he comes up here.
11_04_00_0010     //  Vito!? What the hell are you doing here?!
11_04_00_0020     //  Take it easy, Henry. Put the gun down and send the guys away. I'm gonna explain everything.
11_04_00_0030     //  Boys! Wait for me outside!
11_04_00_0035     //  If I don't come out in a few minutes, come looking for me.
11_04_00_0040     //  Get in there.
11_06_00_0010     //  This has got to be the oldest trick in the book.
11_06_00_0011     //  Come on, come on! Get under the bed.
11_06_00_0020     //  It always works in the movies. C'mon.
11_06_00_0030     //  Shit, Henry, why do you have to be so damn thorough?
11_06_00_0040     //  What the hell!? Vito!? Get the hell out of there!
11_06_00_0050     //  Always works in the movies, huh?
11_07_00_0010     //  What, the both of us? I ain't no queer, I ain't gonna lock myself in a cabinet with another guy.
11_07_00_0020     //  Madonna... Just get in there, Leo, we don't have time!
11_07_00_0030     //  Hey, don't stand so close.
11_07_00_0031     //  You move over!
11_07_00_0032     //  No, you move over.
11_07_00_0035     //  Shut up!
11_07_00_0040     //  Sh! Shut up!
11_07_00_0044     //  Hey... That better be your gun...
11_07_00_0050     //  What the hell?! Vito?
11_07_00_0060     //  Uh... Hey, Henry.
11_07_00_0061     //  This your friend?
11_07_00_0062     //  No, he just wants to hang up his jacket.
11_07_00_0065     //  Alright c'mon, c'mon get out of there. It's about damn time you came out of the closet...
11_08_00_0010     //  This is crazy.
11_08_00_0020     //  Gotta do better than that, old timer.
11_08_00_0030     //  What the hell?! ... Vito? ... Ahh. Fuck!
11_09_00_0001     //  n_...
11_09_00_0002     //  n_...
11_09_00_0003     //  n_...
11_09_00_0010     //  Alright, here we go, c'mon... Tie this tight... Ugh...
11_09_00_0020     //  Alright... Go ahead, Leo.
11_09_00_0021     //  Sh! Leo... Pipe down, will you? C'mon, I'm right behind you. Let's go.
11_09_00_0030     //  Dammit! I'm too old for this shit. If this guy don't kill me, you and your crazy ideas will.
11_09_00_0040     //  Ugh! So what're you gonna do now?
11_09_00_0051     //  Well, first, let's get out of here.
11_09_00_0080     //  No arguments here.
11_09_00_0100     //  Fuckin' shit.
11_10_00_0010     //  Take a seat.
11_10_00_0020     //  What the hell is going on here?
11_10_00_0030     //  Look, Henry, Leo is a friend of mine, alright? He helped me out when I was in prison, he pretty much saved my life... And he's the reason I got made.
11_10_00_0031     //  Look, I didn't know Eddie was going to put a contract out on him. I had to warn him, you gotta understand!
11_10_00_0040     //  Yeah, but you gotta understand that I can't afford to screw this up. If I let Leo go, Falcone will think I fucked him on purpose and he'll have me killed.
11_10_00_0050     //  Dammit, Henry, I'm your friend here! I'd do the same thing for you and you know it!
11_10_00_0060     //  This has nothing to do with friendship, Vito. This is business, and if I screw up, I'm done. I can't let him go. I took a contract and I gotta finish the job.
11_10_00_0065     //  If you don't wanna watch, you can leave. And don't worry about me. I won't tell anybody you were here.
11_10_00_0070     //  Look, Leo told me that all of this is because Falcone's into drugs! He's breaking the rules and he wants to get rid of anybody who knows about it!
11_10_00_0080     //  So what? The only people who aren't breaking those rules are Frank Vinci and Leo here. And those aren't the people who pay me.
11_10_00_0090     //  Vito... Thanks for everything, but leave us now. I've had a long and good life. It's not worth risking your neck to buy an old man a few more years.
11_10_00_0100     //  No, Leo! There's got to be a way...
11_10_00_0110     //  Vito... Go.
11_10_00_0120     //  Sorry, Vito. I won't tell anybody you were here. Just make sure nobody sees you leave.
11_10_00_0130     //  You owe me big for this one, pal.
11_10_00_0140     //  What?
11_10_00_0150     //  Hey, kid.
11_10_00_0155     //  You want a drink?
11_10_00_0160     //  Leo?!
11_10_00_0165     //  What the hell happened?
11_10_00_0170     //  Your friend and I made a deal. I'm gonna disappear. There's nothing left for me in this town anyway since my wife passed. And I was planning to retire someplace warm anyway.
11_11_05_0010     //  Frankie, what are you doing here?
11_11_05_0020     //  Vito, I don't know what to do. I can't go back home. I don't want to see him ever again.
11_11_05_0040     //  Whoa, what happened? See who?
11_11_05_0050     //  Eric!
11_11_05_0060     //  Your husband? Why?
11_11_05_0070     //  He drinks and he parties all the time... And he...
11_11_05_0080     //  Whoa, whoa... Does he hit you?
11_11_05_0090     //  No, but he's seeing somebody... I know he is.
11_11_05_0100     //  Does he hit you?
11_11_05_0110     //  Sometimes...
11_11_05_0120     //  Son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
11_11_05_0130     //  No, Vito! Please, don't hurt him. I just thought you could talk to him. He'll listen to you!
11_11_05_0150     //  Where is he?
11_11_05_0160     //  I don't know. He has a friend who lives on - on River Street. That's usually where he is.
11_11_05_0170     //  OK, OK, alright, it's gonna be alright. Alright listen, hey, hey, when you feel better, you go on home. I'll talk to Eric.
11_11_05_0190     //  If that bastard doesn't come back today and apologize, you call me. But don't worry. I have a feeling he will.
11_11_05_0200     //  OK, Vito, but please don't hurt him, please...
11_11_05_0220     //  Don't worry. I'll go talk some sense into him, OK?
11_12_00_0010     //  Consider this a warning, you touch my sister again I will fucking kill you! Alright?
11_12_00_0011     //  From now on, you're going to stay home, stay off the dope, stop the drinking, and make sure she's fucking happy. If I ever, ever hear she's not happy, I'll find you and finish the fucking job. You got it?
11_12_00_0020     //  Yeah...
11_12_00_0025     //  Ehh, yeah.
11_12_00_0030     //  OK, everybody, party's over! And there won't be any more partying with this guy again, ever! Unless you want me to come back and do the same to the rest of you's, got it?!
11_50_00_0240     //  Torch the place! Do it, now!
11_50_00_0250     //  Hahahahaha! Hahahahaha!
11_50_00_0260     //  Burn, you dago cunt. Burn! Hahahahaha!

11_52_00_0001     //  Get to Leo - fast! Henry will be there soon.
11_52_00_0002     //  Don't let Henry and his goons see you.
11_52_00_0003     //  Escape in a car.
11_52_00_0004     //  You can leave the house through a window.
11_52_00_0005     //  You must get dressed.
11_52_00_0006     //  You were found and shot by Henry's goons.
11_52_00_0007     //  Grab a car and give Galante a lift.
11_52_00_0008     //  You can't use your gun near Henry.
11_52_00_0009     //  Search the laundry basket near the bedroom.
11_58_00_0001     //  Do you want to help Henry with his contract?
11_58_00_0002     //  Sure, business comes first.
11_58_00_0003     //  No, friends come first.
11_58_00_0004     //  What brings you here?.
11_58_00_0005     //  I'm just someone's driver.
11_58_00_0006     //  I'm here to deliver a message for Leo.
11_58_00_0007     //  I came to knock off Leo.
11_58_00_0008     //  Why didn't you go inside?
11_58_00_0009     //  I wouldn't want to surprise him like that.
11_58_00_0010     //  You know I'd like to, but I really got to get goin'.
11_58_00_0011     //  I'm supposed to stay here, but I'd be happy to see Leo too.
11_58_00_0012     //  Old guy's plannin' on cookin' up a storm today, just like the old days, huh?
11_58_00_0013     //  Ya know, this could be the old man's last supper.
11_58_00_0014     //  Sounds good to me. If there's one thing I miss from the can, it's the food.
11_58_00_0015     //  Good one. Always the joker, huh?
11_58_00_0016     //  Do I look like I'm jokin'?
11_58_00_0017     //  Yeah, I'm just fuckin' with ya. I just came by to see how the old man's doin'.
11_58_00_0018     //  Shit! Vito - please tell me you got nothing to do with that!
11_58_00_0019     //  Unfortunately, I do.
11_58_00_0020     //  Hey, I just got here.
11_58_00_0021     //  What do you do?
11_58_00_0022     //  Deal with the Irish now.
11_58_00_0023     //  Let it be.
12_01_00_0011     //  Hey, here he comes.
12_01_00_0012     //  Hey, Vito, take a seat.
12_01_00_0020     //  Hey.
12_01_00_0030     //  What's up?
12_01_00_0040     //  Alright, listen. I've been doing some research into Carlo's business.
12_01_00_0050     //  So?
12_01_00_0060     //  So, the only reason he had Clemente killed was because he was selling dope too and he was stealing his customers.
12_01_00_0061     //  Now he just needs to get rid of one last obstacle. The one guy who could fuck things up and ruin his plan to become the main supplier for the whole city - Frank Vinci.
12_01_00_0070     //  Where'd you get all this?
12_01_00_0080     //  I talked to a few people I trust.
12_01_00_0090     //  OK, so what does this have to do with us?
12_01_00_0100     //  Because... if he can do it, why can't we?
12_01_00_0101     //  A kilo of heroin costs twenty-five hundred bucks over in France. Then it's another thousand bucks to get it here.
12_01_00_0102     //  And?
12_01_00_0103     //  And we pick up eleven grand for just driving the stuff to the dealers! That's seventy-five hundred bucks profit a kilo!
12_01_00_0110     //  Hmmm.
12_01_00_0120     //  Yeah, but what about Falcone?
12_01_00_0130     //  Carlo won't find out. And even if he does, he'll just threaten us and demand a cut.
12_01_00_0140     //  Alright, but if Carlo's the only big supplier in the city, where are you going to buy the stuff from?
12_01_00_0150     //  I'm way ahead of you. What do you two know about about the Tongs?
12_01_00_0160     //  The chinks?
12_01_00_0170     //  Some kind of organization for Chinese immigrants, right?
12_01_00_0175     //  That's what I said, the chinks.
12_01_00_0180     //  Right. But it's also a front for their "other" operations. They run the Chinese quarter, and they keep to themselves.
12_01_00_0181     //  But some of them are interested in doing business with outsiders, and they need middlemen since most people are afraid to deal with them.
12_01_00_0190     //  And we're the middlemen...
12_01_00_0200     //  Yeah. They'll give us ten kilos to start.
12_01_00_0210     //  For how much?
12_01_00_0220     //  Thirty-five grand.
12_01_00_0230     //  And we can sell it for?
12_01_00_0240     //  A hundred and ten.
12_01_00_0250     //  Nice...
12_01_00_0260     //  OK, well, where the hell are we going to get our hands on thirty-five grand?
12_01_00_0270     //  I know a loan shark. The Yid over on Palisade. I think he'll loan us thirty-five if we give him forty-five back. Now that means our take is over twenty grand apiece.
12_01_00_0271     //  Not bad for just moving the shit from one place to another.
12_01_00_0280     //  Yeah... But you know, who's going to end up using this crap?
12_01_00_0290     //  What do you care? As long as it isn't in our neighborhood.
12_01_00_0300     //  Because Vinci was right! Drugs are bad news, they kill people.
12_01_00_0310     //  Look, only idiots do drugs - deadbeats and losers. If they wanna kill themselves so badly, I'll gladly help them out. Especially for twenty grand.
12_01_00_0340     //  I got buyers in the ghetto. They'll take care of the distribution, so we don't need to worry about that. Are you guys in or not?
12_01_00_0350     //  I'm in. C'mon, don't be stupid, Vito. Twenty fucking grand in one afternoon!
12_01_00_0360     //  Ah... When?
12_01_00_0370     //  Right now. If we don't take the offer, the Tongs will just find somebody else.
12_01_00_0380     //  Come on, Vito, it'll be a piece of cake.
12_01_00_0390     //  Let's go see Bruno then. Vito, how about you run us all down there. He's on Palisade Street.
12_01_00_0400     //  OK, let's go.
12_02_00_0010     //  Hi, fellas. We're here to see Bruno.
12_02_00_0020     //  Hiya, Henry.
12_02_00_0030     //  If you got guns on you's, put 'em down there. I gotta search you's.
12_02_00_0040     //  Hello, Henry. So, to what do I owe the pleasure of your company today?
12_02_00_0050     //  Hiya, Bruno.
12_02_00_0051     //  I need thirty-five grand in twenty dollar bills.
12_02_00_0060     //  Ah, that's a lot of money, Henry, a lot of money. Tell me, why should I give that much to a small time guy like you, huh? Convince me.
12_02_00_0070     //  I got a sure thing. You'll have forty-five by the end of the week.
12_02_00_0080     //  What kind of sure thing?
12_02_00_0090     //  Sorry, Bruno. That's a trade secret.
12_02_00_0100     //  Then forty-five is not enough. I'd be more comfortable with sixty-five.
12_02_00_0110     //  That's a bit steep, even for you. Fifty is all I can do.
12_02_00_0120     //  Henry, Henry... I have no guarantee I'll get my money back, and you have nowhere else to go. So... How about sixty? Don't think of it as interest, it's more like my cut of the profits.
12_02_00_0130     //  Fifty-five, final offer. Anything more than that, it's not worth my time.
12_02_00_0140     //  Deal. I'll give you thirty-five thousand dollars today and you'll give me fifty-five thousand by Friday. If you don't pay it back by then, the debt goes up by ten thousand every week.
12_02_00_0150     //  You'll get it by Friday.
12_02_00_0160     //  OK. Isaac, prepare thirty-five thousand dollars in twenty dollar bills.
12_02_00_0170     //  Now you know I trust ya, Henry. But if you screw me, remember these wise words from the Bible:
12_02_00_0171     //  And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
12_02_00_0180     //  Exodus, Chapter 22, Verse 24.
12_02_00_0190     //  Hehehe. I'm impressed. You don't seem like the churchgoing type.
12_02_00_0191     //  Eh, but just remember, the money isn't mine, so even if you get rid of me, that doesn't get rid of your debt. So no funny business, OK, boys?
12_02_00_0200     //  Sure, Bruno.
12_02_00_0210     //  Thank you, Isaac. You want to count it, Henry?
12_02_00_0220     //  I'll take your word for it. And I'll bring it back on Friday along with your "cut."
12_02_00_0230     //  I hope so. Good luck, boys.
12_03_00_0010     //  Welcome, Henry.
12_03_00_0020     //  Hello, Mr. Wong.
12_03_00_0030     //  Let us get straight to business. Is your suitcase heavy enough?
12_03_00_0040     //  See for yourself.
12_03_00_0045     //  Eleven pounds of twenty-dollar bills sir. Thirty-five thousand dollars.
12_03_00_0050     //  Alright, take it away and bring the goods.
12_03_00_0060     //  You're a good man, Henry. Here is your "merchandise."
12_03_00_0070     //  Each bag contains one kilo. Each kilo weighs a little more than two pounds. Which one do you want to test?
12_03_00_0075     //  n_ Lip-smacking
12_03_00_0080     //  OK, we're good.
12_03_00_0090     //  I'm glad. Next time, we can give you twice the amount.
12_03_00_0100     //  It was a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Wong.
12_03_00_0110     //  The pleasure was all mine.
12_03_00_0120     //  Knock it off. See how easy that was? Let's get back in the car.
12_03_00_0270     //  Hello, gentlemen.
12_03_00_0280     //  Fucking setup...
12_03_00_0290     //  I think you have something for us... Drop the suitcases.
12_03_00_0300     //  Hmm, nice shoes!
12_03_00_0310     //  Wait a minute, these guys ain't cops!
12_03_00_0320     //  Shoot, Vito!
12_03_00_0330     //  Kill the bastards!
12_05_00_0010     //  Hey, guys, how are you doing?
12_05_00_0020     //  Hey, man. Come on in.
12_05_00_0025     //  Shit, good smoke, fuck...
12_05_00_0030     //  We did it! We hit the jackpot...
12_05_00_0040     //  Hey hey hey, take it easy, we're not done yet.
12_05_00_0050     //  Lighten up, will you, Henry? What's the matter? All of a sudden, money don't make you happy?
12_05_00_0060     //  After we pay back Bruno and you get your cut, then you could be happy.
12_05_00_0071     //  Alright, alright.

13_05_00_0070     //  What the fuck are you talking about?!
13_05_00_0080     //  What?!
13_05_00_0090     //  Our contact inside the Federal Bureau of Narcotics told me that Henry Tomasino passed them information about our deal.
13_05_00_0100     //  That's a fucking lie!
13_05_00_0110     //  Whoa, whoa, whoa - you saying Henry was a rat?
13_05_00_0120     //  Yes, but not anymore.
13_05_00_0130     //  That's bullshit! It makes no sense. And I suppose you had nothing to do with the little stick up after we closed the deal with you either, right?
13_05_00_0140     //  You think we would take such a stupid risk? And destroy our own factory? That was just another reason to get rid of you. We had problems with you from the very beginning.
13_05_00_0150     //  Oh, yeah? Well, all your problems are just about over, pal. So where's our money?
13_05_00_0160     //  It's not here anymore.
13_05_00_0170     //  What?!
13_05_00_0180     //  Where the hell is it then?
13_05_00_0190     //  I cannot tell you.
13_05_00_0200     //  If you don't tell us, I'm gonna splatter your yellow brains all over this fucking room.
13_05_00_0210     //  If I told you, I'd be dead anyway.
13_05_00_0220     //  Fine, your choice.
13_05_00_0225     //  n_ panting sounds
13_05_00_0230     //  Are you crazy?
13_05_00_0240     //  What'd you want to do, let him go or something?!
13_05_00_0250     //  We could've gotten more out of him!
13_05_00_0260     //  Fuck that! He wouldn't have said nothing. These bastards are tough.
13_05_00_0310     //  Let's just get the hell outta here before the cops come.
13_06_00_0010     //  This deal was a total fucking disaster.
13_06_00_0020     //  Tell me about it.
13_06_00_0030     //  Henry's dead, we don't have Bruno's money, we killed half the Tongs... And if they think Carlo sent us, that will mean war.
13_06_00_0031     //  Pff, we're fucked.
13_06_00_0040     //  Yeah... And if Carlo finds out we got him into this mess...
13_06_00_0050     //  What if Henry really was a rat?
13_06_00_0060     //  No fucking way. Don't even say that. Look, first let's get the money for Bruno. That'll fix at least one problem. But I'm done for today. I need a drink, I'll call you in the morning, we'll figure this shit out.
13_06_00_0070     //  Alright.
13_06_00_0080     //  OK, I'll see you later. And Vito, be careful.
13_51_00_0001     //  EXIT THE DRAGON
13_51_01_0001     //  Get to Lincoln Park.
13_51_01_0002     //  Help Henry! Kill his attackers!
13_51_01_0003     //  Follow the car.
13_51_01_0004     //  Raid the Red Dragon Restaurant.
13_51_01_0005     //  Find Wong.
13_51_01_0006     //  Get the hell out of Chinatown.
13_51_01_0007     //  Get Joe back home.
13_52_00_0001     //  Kill these bastards!
13_52_00_0002     //  Make sure you are ready for action.
13_52_00_0005     //  Wait for Joe.
13_52_00_0006     //  Wong noticed you. Stay further back.
13_52_00_0007     //  Looks like Wong has calmed down. Keep tailing him.
13_52_00_0008     //  Help Joe, you chickenshit.
13_52_00_0009     //  You are too close. Wong will recognize you!
13_52_00_0010     //  You are too far away. Don't lose him!
13_52_00_9001     //  You lost Wong.
13_52_00_9002     //  Wong must lead you to his base.
14_01_00_0010     //  Vito! Good, you're here! You, uh... You hear what happened?
14_01_00_0020     //  What? What's going on?
14_01_00_0030     //  Henry's dead!
14_01_00_0035     //  The fucking chinks hacked him to death in broad daylight.
14_01_00_0040     //  What?!
14_01_00_0045     //  Why?
14_01_00_0050     //  So you don't know anything about it?
14_01_00_0060     //  Well... Henry wanted to bring me in on some deal, but I-I-I passed. What happened?
14_01_00_0070     //  Yeah well, Henry is, well, was, stupid. He was dealing dope with the Tongs. He knew this was off limits and he got caught. Carlo let him off with a small fine and told him he'd forget about it.
14_01_00_0071     //  But the chinks double-crossed Henry and hacked him to pieces in the middle of the park.
14_01_00_0080     //  Shit.
14_01_00_0085     //  Ain't no doing business with the yellow man.
14_01_00_0090     //  But there's worse - Henry wasn't working alone. Yesterday some guys massacred a shitload of the chinks over in Chinatown. Now they figure it must've either been us, or Vinci.
14_01_00_0091     //  They already started threatening Vinci. If this don't get settled fast, we're all in deep shit. You sure you don't know nothing about it?
14_01_00_0100     //  Not a thing, Eddie. I swear.
14_01_00_0110     //  Yeah? How about Joe?
14_01_00_0120     //  Joe? Joe was with me the last couple days.
14_01_00_0130     //  Well, you're lucky then. Carlo's out of town right now, but when he gets back, heh... It ain't gonna be pretty.
14_01_00_0140     //  No shit.
14_01_00_0150     //  You better not be shitting me, Vito.
14_02_00_0010     //  Joe wasn't home.
14_02_00_0020     //  At first I thought he was just running a little late, so I went to grab something to eat.
14_02_00_0030     //  Two hours later, Joe still wasn't home. It was getting dark and I was getting worried. I had to go look for him.
14_05_00_0290     //  Freeze and maybe I won't kill you.
14_05_00_0300     //  Hiya, fellas.
14_05_00_0310     //  Look at the balls on this guy.
14_05_00_0320     //  Nice to see you too.
14_05_00_0330     //  Don't move a muscle!
14_05_00_0340     //  C'mon, listen to the friendly bartender and stop fucking around, Vito.
14_05_00_0350     //  Now, first of all, I gotta ask you to slowly toss your guns on the floor. No funny business neither, the bartender's got the itchiest trigger finger in town, huh?
14_05_00_0420     //  I'm not armed.
14_05_00_0430     //  OK. So what are you doing here, Vito? We wasn't expecting you.
14_05_00_0440     //  I'm looking for Joe Barbaro, I heard some of your guys picked him up.
14_05_00_0450     //  Maybe.
14_05_00_0460     //  What are you trying to pull? Me and Joe didn't do nothing to you.
14_05_00_0470     //  Mister Vinci doesn't seem to think so. He wanted a few things explained to him, so that's what Joe is doing. And since you've stopped by, why don't we go and join them?
14_05_00_0480     //  And what if I don't want to?
14_05_00_0490     //  These guns say you do, but don't worry, it's got a hell of a view.
14_06_00_0010     //  Oh, what the fuck!
14_06_00_0011     //  n_...
14_06_00_0012     //  n_...
14_06_00_0020     //  Aw, what a touching reunion.
14_06_00_0030     //  And who do we have here?
14_06_00_0040     //  This is Joe's buddy, soften him up a bit.
14_06_00_0050     //  With pleasure. Hang him up there.
14_06_00_0060     //  Shit... Oh... Hey, what's up, Joe?
14_06_00_0070     //  Frankenstein's taking a break.
14_06_00_0080     //  Phh... Great, but can you explain to me why the fuck we're here?
14_06_00_0090     //  That old fuck Vinci can't see what's going on right in front of his face and he thinks I can explain it to 'im. Idiot.
14_06_00_0100     //  Aw, the happy couple is here already. Welcome, Vito.
14_06_00_0110     //  What's going on? You got no reason to treat us like this!
14_06_00_0120     //  No reason? No reason?! First, the business with Leo.
14_06_00_0121     //  And then all hell breaks out in the city - the chinks, they're going nuts... Everybody's fighting like lunatics! And now, those yellow bastards are threatening to kill me!
14_06_00_0130     //  It's out of fucking control!
14_06_00_0140     //  Now, I'm too old for this shit, so you're gonna tell me what the hell's going on here! C'mon, I'm all ears...
14_06_00_0150     //  Mr. Vinci! Look, I don't know what the hell's going on here! Believe me. Me and Joe ain't got nothing to do with it.
14_06_00_0160     //  That ain't what I wanna hear.
14_06_00_0170     //  Yeah, well, that's your problem... 'cause we don't know shit about any of this.
14_06_00_0180     //  That's too bad.
14_06_00_0190     //  Finally! We don't got much time.
14_06_00_0200     //  The assholes went to take a leak.
14_06_00_0210     //  We gotta do something.
14_06_00_0220     //  Alright, we'll try to break the pipe. C'mon, help me out - I can't do it by myself.
14_06_00_0230     //  Alright, when I say three, pull down on it.
14_06_00_0240     //  OK.
14_06_00_0250     //  One, two, three!
14_06_00_0260     //  One, two, three! Again.
14_06_00_0270     //  One, two, three!
14_06_00_0280     //  One more time!
14_06_00_0290     //  Thank God for union labor. Come on, get 'em off. It's payback time!
14_13_00_0001     //  Ah...
14_13_00_0002     //  n_Ugh!
14_13_00_0003     //  n_Nngh!
14_13_00_0005     //  n_Eh...
14_13_00_0010     //  Need a hand?
14_13_00_0020     //  Na... I can make it.
14_13_00_0030     //  What do you want me to do with the money?
14_13_00_0040     //  Take it to Bruno.
14_13_00_0050     //  Alright, at least that'll be out of the way.
14_13_00_0060     //  Good evening, gentlemen. Oh, what happened to you?
14_13_00_0070     //  Hey, Doc. I got my ass kicked and I'm coughing up blood.
14_13_00_0080     //  What is happening today? One of your guys is already here.
14_13_00_0090     //  Who?
14_13_00_0100     //  His name is Antonio Balsamo.
14_13_00_0110     //  Tony Balls! What happened to him!?
14_13_00_0122     //  Somebody messed him up pretty good. I don't think he's ever going to walk again.
14_13_00_0130     //  What?!
14_13_00_0140     //  Uh... This surprises you? All the blood, all the death.
14_13_00_0142     //  n_Ugh!
14_13_00_0143     //  n_Mmgh!
14_13_00_0144     //  n_Oh... Argh...
14_13_00_0145     //  n_Argh... Eh...
14_13_00_0146     //  This is the lifestyle you choose.
14_13_00_0147     //  One day your luck is bound to run out. The next time, it could be you.
14_13_00_0150     //  Enough with the sermon, Doc. You have time to treat Joe?
14_13_00_0160     //  Yes, but you'll have to wait a minute while I fix Antonio up.
14_13_00_0170     //  That's OK, Doc.
14_13_00_0180     //  Alright,  come in.
14_13_00_0190     //  Make sure you settle things with Bruno, OK? And Vito... Thanks.
14_13_00_0200     //  Sure thing. Feel better.
14_14_00_0010     //  Good evening. You have the money for me? Or do you wish to extend the deadline?
14_14_00_0020     //  Here it is.
14_14_00_0030     //  I have to admit, this is somewhat of a surprise! I heard you boys had some... complications.
14_14_00_0040     //  Yeah, we did.
14_14_00_0050     //  I heard that Henry is dead. I'm very sorry to hear that.
14_14_00_0061     //  Isaac, count it.
14_14_00_0070     //  So your little business venture was a success? 
14_14_00_0080     //  You got your money, right?
14_14_00_0090     //  Right, right. It's just that the whole city has been turned upside down. The Chinese think the Italians attacked them, so they're going after Vinci.
14_14_00_0091     //  That's not good, not good. Would that have anything to do with the reason you borrowed this money?
14_14_00_0100     //  Sorry, Bruno. That's none of your business.
14_14_00_0110     //  Ah, thank you, Isaac. It looks like the debt is settled... I don't even know your name.
14_14_00_0120     //  Vito.
14_14_00_0130     //  Vito who?
14_14_00_0140     //  Vito Scaletta.
14_14_00_0150     //  Eh, Scaletta? I knew a Scaletta once. But I must say, you're much better at paying back your debts than he was.
14_14_00_0160     //  His poor wife had to do it for him...
14_14_00_0170     //  So, it was you who lent my father the money...
14_14_00_0180     //  Your father? Ahh, like father like son... I see you don't approve. But, I didn't make him borrow the money, now did I? Just like I didn't make you.
14_14_00_0190     //  If you ever need a loan, you know where to find me.
14_14_00_0200     //  Ss... Sure.
14_15_00_0010     //  I couldn't sleep... Things were bad and they were only gonna get worse...
14_15_00_0020     //  The truth was gonna come out sooner or later, and then we were gonna have Falcone after us along with the Chinese and Vinci.
14_15_00_0021     //  This wasn't how I imagined it when we were startin' out. I dreamed o' money, cars, women, respect, freedom...
14_15_00_0022     //  I guess I ended up gettin' all of that more or less, but along with it came prison, living in constant fear, and the blood of my friends.
14_15_00_0030     //  I ducked it as long as I could, but it was finally catching up with me. It was all just a matter of time...
14_20_00_0010     //  Vito!
14_20_00_0011     //  Hey, thanks for coming by - I knew I could count on you!
14_20_00_0020     //  What for?
14_20_00_0030     //  n_ chewing, eating
14_20_00_0031     //  Frank's organizing a sit down with the other bosses and he took almost all my guys as bodyguards...
14_20_00_0032     //  ... so I don't have nobody around to handle this here job for me.
14_20_00_0040     //  Hey...
14_20_00_0050     //  Derek, these guys still don't want to work.
14_20_00_0060     //  What? Why?
14_20_00_0070     //  'Cause of that deadbeat you fired.
14_20_00_0080     //  Shit... Well, Vito, that other thing'll have to wait. Can you help us out here with this first?
14_20_00_0090     //  What's happening?
14_20_00_0100     //  Well, this deadbeat didn't come to work for a whole week. Pretending he was sick - total bullshit. So I fired his ass.
14_20_00_0101     //  Anyway, some of his buddies are upset and they're threatening to strike. All I gotta do is show up with a few guys who look like they mean business.
14_20_00_0110     //  That'll scare 'em and they'll forget all about it. I'll give you a thousand bucks. Are you in?
14_20_00_0120     //  Alright, I ain't gonna say no to that kind of money.
14_20_00_0130     //  Alright! All you need to do is stand behind me and look tough. Right, Steve?
14_20_00_0140     //  We'll see.
14_50_00_0010     //  Mr. Angelo?
14_50_00_0020     //  Uhh... Yes?
14_50_00_0030     //  Mr. Salieri sends his regards.
14_51_00_0001     //  STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN
14_51_01_0001     //  You have collected enough money. Go see Joe.
14_51_01_0002     //  See if Eddie knows where Joe is.
14_51_01_0003     //  Check with Giuseppe.
14_51_01_0004     //  Earn $27,500 for Bruno.
14_51_01_0005     //  Get in the car.
14_51_01_0006     //  Find the construction site where Vinci is holding Joe.
14_51_01_0007     //  Find Joe and save him.
14_51_01_0008     //  Find Joe and save him. Don't get seen!
14_51_01_0009     //  Follow his orders.
14_51_01_0010     //  Get inside.
14_51_01_0011     //  Get out of the building with Joe.
14_51_01_0012     //  Take Joe to El Greco's.
14_51_01_0013     //  Pay Bruno back.
14_51_01_0014     //  Earn $55,000 for Bruno.
14_51_01_0015     //  Go home.
14_51_01_0016     //  Take the money and run.
14_51_91_0001     //  Get in the loaded van.
14_51_91_0002     //  Drive the van to the garage to meet Vinci's guys.
14_51_91_0003     //  Drive to the top floor.
14_51_91_0004     //  Get in Jack's car.
14_51_91_0005     //  Get out of the garage.
14_51_91_0006     //  Let Harry know what happened here.
14_52_00_0001     //  Repair your car before meeting the guy.
14_52_00_0002     //  Take the gun.
14_52_02_0002     //  Do not leave this area. Get in the car first!
14_52_02_0003     //  Don't leave the roof. You are supposed to supervise the transaction.
14_52_03_0001     //  Ready your weapon.
14_52_03_0002     //  Follow Derek to the warehouse.
14_52_03_0003     //  Search Derek's office.
14_52_03_0004     //  You can give weapons to the workers.
14_52_03_0007     //  Rob shops or bring cars to Bruski.
14_55_00_0130     //  Hey, Giuseppe. I'm looking for Joe Barbaro. Was he here today?
14_55_00_0140     //  Alo, Vito. Yeah, Joe came by today.
14_55_00_0150     //  Great. I've been looking for him the whole day. Did he say where he was heading?
14_55_00_0160     //  Well, no, he didn't. I don't think he know himself.
14_55_00_0170     //  How come?
14_55_00_0180     //  Well, he was looking for a job, but before we managed to finish our conversation, a few guys came and took him away.
14_55_00_0190     //  What?! Who?
14_55_00_0200     //  It was Vinci's people. They said Mr. Vinci wanted a word with him.
14_55_00_0210     //  You know where they would've went?
14_55_00_0220     //  No lo so. Maybe to their bar, the Mona Lisa.
14_55_00_0230     //  Shit.
14_55_00_0240     //  Is something wrong?
14_55_00_0250     //  Not sure... Let's just say we're not on the best of terms with Mister Vinci these days.
14_55_00_0260     //  Yeah, Joe didn't look too happy.
14_55_00_0270     //  I got a bad feeling about this. I better go find out what's going on.
14_55_00_0280     //  I hope it's nothing serious. Buona fortuna, Vito.
14_58_00_0001     //  Do you want to be the driver?
14_58_00_0002     //  Yes.
14_58_00_0003     //  No.
14_58_00_0004     //  Do you want to restart the mission?
14_58_01_0001     //  Do you want to help Joe?
14_58_03_0001     //  Do you want to help Derek?
14_58_03_0002     //  Yes.
14_58_03_0003     //  I have no choice. I need money.
14_58_03_0004     //  No.
15_01_00_2110     //  Yeah, hello.
15_01_00_2120     //  Vito. Yeah, it's Eddie. Uh, listen, I need you to-
15_01_00_2130     //  Let me guess. You need me to come by right away, and I should bring a gun.
15_01_00_2140     //  For once I don't, heh. Yeah, Carlo wants to see you over at the planetarium.
15_01_00_2150     //  He say what it was about?
15_01_00_2160     //  Nope. Better head over there now, though. Don't want to keep the man waiting, heh. Yeah, see you, Vito.
15_02_00_0010     //  So, what's the problem here, fellas?
15_02_00_0020     //  We want you to give Big John his job back.
15_02_00_0030     //  It's me that decides who gets hired and fired around here, and I say he's fired.
15_02_00_0040     //  All we're asking is for you to hire him back. He's got a family and needs a job.
15_02_00_0050     //  I've made my decision.
15_02_00_0060     //  See!? I told you!
15_02_00_0070     //  Easy does it, Vinnie! We want to do this peacefully.
15_02_00_0080     //  Easy? We bust our asses day in and day out for this fat fuck.
15_02_00_0081     //  And if anything ever happens to us, he'll screw us over just like he did John!
15_02_00_0090     //  Lower your voice now, young man! I don't want to hear another word about that fucking deadbeat!
15_02_00_0100     //  Who you calling a deadbeat?! A crate fell on the poor guy while he was working!
15_02_00_0101     //  For you! Broke both his damn hands!
15_02_00_0110     //  Well, that's his fucking problem, not mine.
15_02_00_0111     //  Now I suggest you's get back to work before somebody else's hands get broken!
15_02_00_0120     //  You goddamned bastard!
15_02_00_0130     //  You fellas are really starting to piss me off.
15_02_00_0140     //  There's no need for violence. Please, put it down. We don't want no trouble.
15_02_00_0150     //  It don't look that way to me! Right now, looks like you got big trouble, don't you's?!
15_02_00_0160     //  Now, if you's all don't want to start looking for new jobs, you'll be back to work in the next ten minutes.
15_02_00_0161     //  You see Vito? All they do is bitch and moan.
15_02_00_0170     //  Vito? You're Scaletta's boy, ain't ya? Your dad used to talk about you all the time. You look just like 'im.
15_02_00_0171     //  But what are you doing working for this bastard? After what he did to your old man?
15_02_00_0180     //  Shut your fucking mouth, right now.
15_02_00_0190     //  Don't listen to him, Vito. He's full of shit... C'mon, let's go.
15_02_00_0200     //  Full of shit, huh? That bastard killed your father, Vito.
15_02_00_0210     //  What?
15_02_00_0220     //  Derek?
15_02_00_0230     //  They're just trying to get under your skin.
15_02_00_0231     //  Hey, stop pointing that gun at me.
15_02_00_0240     //  Why don't you ask him how your dad "drowned" that night!
15_02_00_0250     //  Shut up!
15_02_00_0260     //  We seen him take a walk with Steve, and then Steve come back alone, and all wet!
15_02_00_0270     //  Stop pointing that thing at me!
15_02_00_0280     //  What the hell happened with my father, Derek?
15_02_00_0290     //  Are you nuts or what? Who you gonna trust, me or these now unemployed losers? We known each other for a long time, Vito. Think of all the things...
15_02_00_0300     //  Why were you all wet, Steve? You dive in and try to save him?
15_02_00_0310     //  Because he wouldn't stay underwater.
15_02_00_0320     //  Keep your mouth shut!
15_02_00_0330     //  Vito, you swore an oath! I was there.
15_02_00_0331     //  Our loyalty to the family is greater than to our own families.
15_02_00_0340     //  Tell that to my mother...
15_02_00_0350     //  Eh, should I kill him?
15_02_00_0361     //  No, not here... We'll settle things with him later...
15_02_00_0362     //  You disappoint me, Vito... You really do...
15_02_00_0380     //  I'm gonna do a hell of a lot more than disappoint you, Derek...
15_02_00_0400     //  Your dad...
15_02_00_0410     //  Not right now. I gotta get that fuck before he runs away.
15_02_00_0490     //  Vinnie! Where'd you get that?
15_02_00_0500     //  Time to teach that fat fuck a lesson!
15_02_00_0510     //  Doesn't matter.
15_04_00_2010     //  Mr. Scaletta, can you get in please?
15_04_00_2020     //  Vito.  Get in the car.
15_04_00_2030     //  Hey, old man! What are you doing back?
15_04_00_2040     //  Just get in the damn car. Now.
15_04_00_2050     //  And you are...
15_04_00_2060     //  This is our friend, Mr. Chu.
15_04_00_2070     //  Alright... So what the hell's going on, Leo? What is this?
15_04_00_2080     //  This is about you.
15_04_00_2090     //  You fucked up good, didn't you?
15_04_00_2100     //  Started a fucking war.
15_04_00_2110     //  Got no idea what you're talking about.
15_04_00_2120     //  Don't fuck with me, boy. I probably forgotten more about this business than you'll ever learn.
15_04_00_2130     //  Half our guys are dead, half of Mr. Chu's guys are dead, and now the Feds are breathing down everybody's necks, because of you.
15_04_00_2140     //  Leo, listen-
15_04_00_2150     //  You listen - if it wasn't for me, you would've already been taken care of. So you're gonna listen to what I have to say and you're gonna listen good.
15_04_00_2160     //  What you did in Chinatown - that was because of that cocksucker Henry, right? You know who he was working for when he died?
15_04_00_2170     //  You mean when he was butchered?
15_04_00_2180     //  He was working for Carlo with me and Joe.
15_04_00_2190     //  He was working for the Feds. He was a fuckin' rat. That's why Mr. Chu's people did what they did. And that's why the Feds are going after Carlo now.
15_04_00_2200     //  He's been selling dope for years.  If he cuts a deal, he's gonna take the rest of us down too. It's a fucking mess.
15_04_00_2210     //  So the Commission wants Carlo taken care of, along with his top guys.
15_04_00_2220     //  But I don't forget my friends, Vito. You did for me, so I did for you. I called in a few favors, got you one chance to make this right.
15_04_00_2230     //  Which is?
15_04_00_2231     //  OK. I'm listening.
15_04_00_2232     //  OK. You got my attention.
15_04_00_2240     //  You're gonna get rid of Carlo, do us all a favor.
15_04_00_2250     //  And if I refuse?
15_04_00_2251     //  And what if I say no?
15_04_00_2260     //  You die. Frank and the rest of the Commission want you dead. So does Mr. Chu. And to top it all off, you vouched for a rat. You think Carlo's gonna let that slide? You're a dead man walking.
15_04_00_2270     //  When?
15_04_00_2280     //  Now. Every minute we wait is another minute we give to the Feds.
15_04_00_2290     //  He's holed up at that observatory of his. He knows something's up. Carlo Falcone is lot of things, but stupid ain't one of 'em.
15_04_00_2300     //  Alright. Stop the car.
15_04_00_2301     //  Remember, kid - this is your last chance.
15_04_00_2302     //  You know what you gotta do.
15_05_00_2010     //  Well, look who it is...
15_05_00_2020     //  This is who they send? This is an insult.
15_05_00_2030     //  What'd they tell you, Vito? Take care of me and all's forgiven? You really think they're just gonna let you walk after everything you did?
15_05_00_2040     //  Then again chumps like you never do think about the big picture...
15_05_00_2050     //  But your buddy Joe understands, don't you Joe?
15_05_00_2060     //  What the fuck is this?
15_05_00_2070     //  Vito, you gone nuts?
15_05_00_2071     //  I could ask you the same question.
15_05_00_2080     //  Loyalty's a funny thing, huh, Vito?
15_05_00_2090     //  No such thing as friendship in this business. Didn't your old pal Leo teach you that while you were sucking his cock back in the can?
15_05_00_2100     //  Hahaha... You're just a fucking pawn, Vito. That's all you ever were. When are you gonna realize that?
15_05_00_2110     //  Joe - you just gotta trust me.
15_05_00_2120     //  You think I give a shit about the Feds, or those tired old fucks on the Commission?
15_05_00_2130     //  They're using you, Vito... Just like Clemente used you. Just like I used you. Just like that rat fuck Henry used you.
15_05_00_2140     //  You vouched for that piece of shit, brought him into my house.
15_05_00_2150     //  And now, you dumb fuck, you're gonna pay for it.
15_05_00_2160     //  Now, Joe.
15_05_00_2170     //  What are you waiting for?
15_05_00_2180     //  Hey. If you're gonna pull that trigger, do it already.
15_05_00_2190     //  Vito...
15_05_00_2200     //  Let's shoot this cocksucker. On three.
15_05_00_2210     //  One...
15_05_00_2220     //  Remember what we talked about Joe! You gonna throw that all away!? Do it!
15_05_00_2230     //  Two...
15_05_00_2240     //  NOW!
15_05_00_2300     //  You know something, Carlo?  For the last 10 years, all I done was kill.
15_05_00_2310     //  I killed for my country...
15_05_00_2320     //  Ugh!
15_05_00_2330     //  I killed for my family...
15_05_00_2340     //  Ugh!
15_05_00_2350     //  I killed anybody that got in my way.
15_05_00_2360     //  Ugh!
15_05_00_2390     //  Fucking pawn...
15_05_00_2391     //  Fuck... you...
15_05_00_2400     //  But this one... This one's for me.
15_05_00_2401     //  Fucking prick...
15_05_00_2402     //  Alright. It's done.
15_11_00_0010     //  What the hell is this?
15_11_00_0020     //  It's alright, Joe.
15_11_00_0030     //  Is it done?
15_11_00_0031     //  Did you take care of it?
15_11_00_0032     //  It's done.
15_11_00_0040     //  Alright then. Looks like a celebration is in order. C'mon, let's head to the cathouse.
15_11_00_0050     //  Sounds good to me.
15_11_00_0060     //  Come with me, Vito. There's more we need to talk about.
15_11_00_0070     //  Alright, we'll see you over there.
15_11_00_0071     //  Alright. So what's the big secret?
15_11_00_0072     //  Alright, I did what you wanted, so now what?
15_11_00_0073     //  Alright, so now what?
15_11_00_0074     //  Alright, so what happens next?
15_11_00_0080     //  Hey, hey! What's the hell's going on?  Where are they taking Joe?
15_11_00_0081     //  Hey, hey... What the fuck is this?
15_11_00_0082     //  Hey, hey... Where the fuck are they going?
15_11_00_0083     //  Where the fuck is that car going, Leo?
15_11_00_0084     //  Hey, what the fuck... You wanna tell me where the fuck that car's going, Leo?
15_11_00_0085     //  Hey, hey... What the hell's going on here?
15_11_00_0086     //  Hey, what the fuck is this? I thought we had a deal!
15_11_00_0087     //  Hey, hey... Where's that car going? I thought we had a deal!
15_11_00_0090     //  Sorry, kid.  Joe wasn't part of our deal.
15_11_00_0100     //  Frank only wanted to talk to you. Sorry, kid, it's just business.
15_11_00_0110     //  That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Our deal only covered you. Joe has a meeting with Mr. Chu. That was the price of peace. I'm sorry, kid.
15_11_00_0120     //  Sorry, kid. Frank only wanted to talk to you. Didn't I teach you anything about this business?
15_11_00_0130     //  Frank only wants to talk to you. Come on, kid.  Didn't I teach you anything about this business?
15_11_00_0140     //  Sorry, kid. Joe wasn't part of our deal. They're taking him for a ride. Didn't I teach you anything about this business?
15_11_00_0141     //  Sorry, kid. Our deal only covered you.
15_11_00_0150     //  They're taking him for a ride, and there ain't a damn thing we can do about it. That's just the way things work. I thought you would've figured that out by now.
15_11_00_0160     //  That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Somebody had to take the fall for what you guys did in Chinatown. That's just the way things work.
15_11_00_0170     //  Me and Frank want to talk to you about the future, Vito. Your buddy Joe doesn't figure. That was the deal - you helped me so I helped you. Your friend needs to make his own peace.
15_11_00_0180     //  It's funny how guys like us are called Men of Honor - you know, back in the old country. There's no such thing as honor in our world, Vito. We built our organizations on mutual interest - we all get richer quicker when we work together. But the moment that changes, well, then it's every man for himself.
15_11_00_0190     //  Frank's prepared to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start. After what you and your buddies did, you're damn lucky to be alive.
15_11_00_0200     //  We'll make sure your buddy Joe is taken care of. Let's talk about you what comes next for you, Vito. Smart guys in this business can go a long way, so long as you never forget that it's work, it's a job, it's the way we survive. Its called "The Life" for a reason, you know. Once you're in, the only way you are ever getting out is in a coffin.
15_11_00_0210     //  To be honest with you, kid, I'm surprised he lived this long.
15_11_00_0220     //  (being choked)
15_11_00_0221     //  Hey, where you going guys? The cathouse is the other... Oh fuck!
15_11_00_0222     //  We thought we could break the rules... That we could make our own. But all we did was create chaos.
15_11_00_0223     //  It slowly devoured us all.
15_11_00_0224     //  And there was no way back.
15_11_00_0999     //  n_ there's no heaven for wiseguys...
15_12_00_0030     //  Hey, Vito.  The boss wants to see you.
15_12_00_0031     //  Hey, fellas.
15_12_00_0040     //  Good.  I wanna see him too.
15_12_00_0050     //  One uh... One thing though, Vito...I gotta take your gun.
15_12_00_0060     //  Yeah alright, here you go.
15_12_00_0061     //  Oh, you mean this gun!

21_53_01_0001     //  The head of the Mob is Big Sal Gravina - an old friend who sold you out then tried to have you killed in jail. He's first on the hitlist. Big Sal's gang smuggles hundreds of stolen vehicles into the US every month and sells them at a premium. Let Sal know you are back in town by trashing a shipment of cars down at the docks.
21_53_02_0001     //  You tracked down Pepe Gambino. Pepe is a two-bit waste of skin who gets off on beating hookers, but he hangs around Sal Gravina like a bad smell. Maybe he can lead you closer to his boss. Follow him around, maybe Pepe has a use after all...
21_53_03_0001     //  Selling black market cigarettes and weapons brings in big money for Sal Gravina. He doesn't care what his street dealers sell or who they sell to, even to kids. Find the dealers and beat some social responsibility into them. No guns though - practice what you preach!
21_53_04_0001     //  Sal Gravina runs smuggled gas across the country in tankers. Each tanker is worth thousands of dollars to him. It would be a great shame if his trucks got destroyed somehow. Gas is so flammable after all... Destroy the tankers.
21_53_05_0001     //  You got the low-down on Frankie Stones. He's a high-up mobster from out of town who is here to discuss the end of a long-running turf war. That asswipe Gravina's going to have a lot of explaining to do to the Commission when Stones shows up dead...
21_53_06_0001     //  The papers are saying that Big Sal's brother Tiny got charged with drug trafficking. Seeing that little shit go down would be hilarious, but you know how the Gravinas operate. The only witness has no protection. Save him from Mob killers to ensure he testifies.
21_53_07_0001     //  It's your lucky day! A good friend told you where to find Gravina's consigliere, an old fart called Ettore. Ettore is the real brains of the Gravina outfit. The problem is that those brains are in his head. They'd look better on a wall. Take care of him.
21_53_08_0001     //  You're getting so close to Big Sal that you can smell his pomade. But first things first. Each of the three capos in Sal's gang tried to have you killed in prison. It's time to pay them back, with interest.
21_53_09_0001     //  Sweet Federico is Big Sal's accountant and the only man who understands the Mob finances. He runs a healthy sideline blackmailing fellow gangsters when their books don't balance. Take him out before finishing Gravina, just to make sure none of these dumb fuck guidos can pick up the pieces.
21_53_10_0001     //  You got Big Sal just where you want him. Of course he's called his ass-kissers in for one last smooch. No matter, you'd have to deal with them eventually. Kill them all and finish the Gravina family for good.
21_53_11_0001     //  Jimmyboy! It's Sal Gravina, how you doing? Listen - I got some work that's right up your street. You know Elroy Tussle? He heads up a two-bit gang called "The Bombers" or something stupid like that. Yeah, black guy, hangs out in Sand Island. Tussle's had some hookers working the streets over in Little Italy. That's not on. Beat up a few Bomber pimps, teach 'em to stick to their own neighborhood.
21_53_12_0001     //  Jimmyboy! It's Sal Gravina, how you doing? Listen - you know Elroy Tussle? He heads up a two-bit gang called "The Bombers" or something stupid like that.  Those retards stole a bunch of cars last night from Tony, over at the dock. I don't give a fuck about the cars, but I won't have those bastards mess with me. Find the cars they took and wreck them! Anyone gets in your way... well that's too bad.
21_53_13_0001     //  Hi, Jimmy, it's Sal here. Me and a couple of the boys here have been thinking. Elroy Tussle needs his wings clipped. These Bombers are becoming a real headache. Tussle runs a protection racket in Sand Island. We should question his ability to protect his clients, you know what I mean? Get down there and do a little vandalism. Three stores ought to do it.
21_53_14_0001     //  Jimmy! Sal Gravina. I've been hearing that one of Tussle's captains has been mouthing off, saying that my crew don't got what it takes, saying he's going to take me out, and all the usual kind of bullshit. They call this idiot Dirty Daniel. Fuck knows why. Anyway, I want you to kill him, because I don't take shit from a guy that sounds like a sex pest.
21_53_15_0001     //  Hi, Jimmy. The Bombers are running drugs around the city and I just won't stand for it. Drugs are bad news Jim, they make people crazy. Plus the fact that they are making that asshole Elroy Tussle rich!   I'm hearing that his crew uses fruit and vegetable deliveries as a cover for moving this muck around. Destroy all their trucks. Hopefully that will close this business down for good.
21_53_16_0001     //  Jimmy, it's Sal. I'm sick and tired of drugs. They're everywhere these days! All the kids are whacked out on dope, I even caught a couple of my guys getting stoned. It's the fucking Bombers who are behind it all, those cheap dirty bastards. Elroy Tussle uses the backstreets around Sand Island as pick up spots. Destroy the crates that hold the drug stashes, maybe we can stop the supply.
21_53_17_0001     //  Hey, Jimmy, it's Sal. I'm hearing that Elroy is pissed about the drug hits. Haha, music to my ears! There's a problem though. I got word that Tussle employed a headhunter to take care of me. They call this punk Charon because he places coins on the lips of his victims. Wooo, I'm shitting myself here... Go take care of this amateur for me would you?
21_53_18_0001     //  Jimmy? Sal. Apparently a couple of Bomber punks lied in court and sent Tony Scalone down for a ten stretch! This is fucking low, Jimmy. I can hardly believe it! Me and Elroy might have our differences, but this is plain wrong. I just know Elroy will be behind this, he must have paid those lying fucks big to put their tiny balls on the line. Kill them.
21_53_19_0001     //  Jimmy? Its Sal. I heard that the Bombers' main drug supplier is in town to discuss the problems they've been having recently. This is perfect! We got a chance to stop the flow of this evil shit at the source! Kill the dealer and send Elroy Tussle and his boys back to dealing in moonshine and stolen radios.
21_53_20_0001     //  Jimmy? It's Sal. I just had a little meeting with your friend Tam Brodie. We're both in agreement that there has been too much chaos recently, too much violence. We're both getting a lot of heat from the law. So, we need to finish off the Bombers, kill Elroy Tussle. He's holed up at the old Distillery in Sand Island with his halfwit brother Duke. Take them both out.
21_53_21_0001     //  Jimmy! It's Tam Brodie. Listen - I got two hundred crates of hooky beer sitting in my basement that I can't shift for love nor money. Why? Because the Chinese are flooding the city with cheap chinky booze.  I've got bills to pay, you get me? They store the drink down at the dock. Find the booze and destroy it.
21_53_22_0001     //  Jimmy? How you doing, boyo? I have a little something for you. Me cousin Sean is opening a restaurant. Problem is, the Chinese are running a street carnival on his opening day. Giving out free food and all that, it's going to be a disaster for Sean. Do me a favor and wreck their food supplies would you? I'll make it worth your while...
21_53_23_0001     //  Jimmy, ya' baldy bastard. It's Tam. I'm sorry to say I got more trouble with the Chinese. They've trucks going around the city flogging some imported Chinese liquor called Fire Water. I won't have those sneaky little eejits peddling booze on my turf. Truth be told though, I'm getting quite a taste for the Fire Water meself. Steal me one of them Chinese trucks and get it back here without spilling the booze and I'll take you out for a nice dram.
21_53_24_0001     //  Jimmy! Tam. Things are getting a little complicated with the Chinese. Some asshole called Eddie Fu beat the shit out of me cousin Sean and his crew last night. Now you know me, Jimmy, I'm a family man. I'm gonna rip Eddie Fu's balls off and feed them to the rats. But first I'm going to destroy his crew and burn the whole of Chinatown to the ground. Just get out there and smash some Chinese businesses for now, would you?
21_53_24_0002     //  Jimmy, that you? It's Tam. Right, I got the names of the fucks that beat up on my cousin Sean. They're all Chinese traders. I suppose that we shit in their noodles when we wrecked the carnival, eh? Anyway,  they have to die for what they did to Sean. Take them out for me Jimmy, they've got it coming.
21_53_25_0001     //  Jimmy! Tam. I've been poking around for information on our friend Eddie Fu. Turns out his brother-in-law is a customs officer down at the port. That must be how they smuggle all their cut-price Asian crap into the city. That's the key to the whole Chinese operation. The way I figure it, if you could arrange for this customs guy to have a little... accident, that would be grand. You can probably find him driving to work with his two henchmen, who won't be much of a problem for you, I guess.
21_53_26_0001     //  Jimmy, it's Tam. Yeah, it's about Eddie Fu. How did you guess? That little cocksucker's brother has been paying the cops to shake down my boys. I just had to spend a few hours in the cells meself. I can't just let that go, now can I? Find Fu's brother and kill him.
21_53_27_0001     //  Jimmy, it's Tam. Things are bad, Jimmy. First, I'm fucking shitfaced. Second, I'm getting some real trouble now from the Chinese. They threatened me Ma, Jimmy. Me fucking Ma! I want you to send them a message. Those eejits like fireworks right? Well, we'll give them fireworks. I got you a car full of explosives. Use it to blow something up in the centre of Chinatown. That'll make 'em choke on their beancurd, now won't it?
21_53_28_0001     //  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Tam. Eddie Fu found out what we did to his brother. The cheeky fucker just called, told me he's sending out two Chinese assassins to fucking kill me. Would you credit the nerve on that one? I don't know any of this ching chong kung fu shit Jim, I need you to take these pesky little fuckers out for me. Would you do that?
21_53_29_0001     //  Jimmy? Tam Brodie. Do you read the papers at all? I've been having a good old laugh today, Eddie Fu is all over the news. Someone from his organisation is ratting him out, selling him and the whole Chinese gang down the river. There just one problem. Little Eddie's put a big price on the rat's head. You gotta protect him so he can testify!
21_53_29_0002     //  Jimmy, it's Tam. Our Oriental problem just got a whole lot worse. The Chinese bosses have sent over three new captains from Hong Kong to fix the problems they've been having lately. As if Eddie Fu wasn't bad enough! We need to move fast, before the fuckers get settled in. There's a big meet up happening in Milleville. With a bit of luck if we kill them now the Chinese will give up on this city.
21_53_30_0001     //  Jimmy, it's Tam. Listen boy, this is important. I just had a sit down with Sal Gravina, and we reckon it's high time we do away with the Chinese before they cause a fucking war. That prick Eddie Fu is hiding out in a restaurant in Chinatown.  We was thinking you could get down there and wipe him and his crew out for good. There's a pretty penny in it for you, if you're up to it of course... What do you say?
21_53_30_0002     //  Jimmy! Sal. I just spoke to Tam Brodie, he told me you dealt with Eddie Fu. And of course you solved our little problem with the Tussle brothers too... You did the right thing here Jimmy, Empire Bay's a better place without those scumbags. You need to get paid. We'll do the handover in Riverside near the railway bridge. One of my boys is driving there now. He's in a bright red car - a sporty little number. The cash is in the trunk. You can keep the car as well. Thanks again Jimmy!
21_53_31_0001     //  You just heard The Irishman is still alive. Tam Brodie, the dirty Irish bastard, you worked with him for years, but that didn't stop him from framing you to cover his tracks. That crazy fucker has a death wish, I guess it's up to you to make that wish come true. Word is that he's running a gas racket. Blow up a couple of his gas stations. That'll let Tam know you're looking for him.
21_53_32_0001     //  Looks like Tam's up to his old tricks, bullying shopkeepers for small change. His goons are pounding the streets, dishing out threats, thrashings, or worse. Somebody needs to rein them in. Beat the Irish thugs and make an example out of them for others to see. Don't kill them either; you want these fuckwits to show their scars around the neighborhood.
21_53_33_0001     //  Tam Brodie's boys just hijacked a truckload of cigarettes. The truck is just sitting in a yard over by the Dipton Bridge while the micks figure out what to do with it. You know a guy in Hunters who buys cigarettes in bulk... so help yourself.
21_53_34_0001     //  The Irishman's crew stole 30 grand worth of fur coats from a warehouse at the port. That's a pretty good haul, but you can't let Tam have all that cash, now can you? Destroy the crates containing the coats so that they can't be sold.
21_53_35_0001     //  Irish gangsters have always congregated in a shithole pub called The Hill of Tara. Seems like a perfect opportunity to leave a message for Tam... why don't you stop by and pay his boys a visit? Destroy the bar and kill all the micks.
21_53_36_0001     //  You got word that the Irishmen have been planning a heist at a warehouse. Disrupt the plan by destroying their getaway trucks and leaving the Micks red-handed at the scene. Don't allow them to finish the job and line Brodie's pockets.
21_53_37_0001     //  Brodie just bought new cars for his top boys. He's feeling the heat, trying to buy his gang's loyalty before you turn up for a showdown. He didn't show you any loyalty when he framed you. Trash the cars and show Brodie's crew that sticking with him is a loser's game.
21_53_38_0001     //  Brodie is losing his grip on his protection racket. One shopkeeper is refusing to pay the fees. Protect this shopkeeper and his shop, and surely more of Tam's victims will stop paying too. When Tam's income starts drying up, his gang will evaporate.
21_53_39_0001     //  Brodie's gang is falling apart. There are three hardcore members that will never quit, though - Brodie's cousins Sean, James, and Bill. They invited you to a meeting at the scrapyard. You know that it's a trap. What the Brodies don't know, however, is that you are the trapper.
21_53_40_0001     //  The time has come to pay Tam a visit. You have terrorized him, wiped out his gang, destroyed his livelihood. Now all that remains is to kill the stupid fuck. He should have known better than to cross you...

21_53_51_0001     //  One of our customers has asked for a Shubert Pickup. A little truck like that is perfect for him to quickly move contraband up the coast to Empire Bay.
21_53_51_0011     //  A friend of mine needs a Shubert 38. He's got several contacts in the warehouses around Millville who will fill the truck while nobody's looking.
21_53_51_0021     //  My nephew's getting married and I want to give him a gift - a Smith Coupe. I know of one that's had some work done on it already - it'll be perfect for him and his new family.
21_53_51_0031     //  I just had some movie producer asking me about a Smith V8, he needs an old car to blow up. He's got money to spend, all you need to do is steal me one of those junkers.
21_53_51_0041     //  One of my best customers runs a garage. Sells car parts, hooks me up with some good business. He also sells gas. Generally of the stolen variety. Find and steal a Hank Fuel Truck for him before his pumps run dry.
21_53_52_0001     //  Some wacko just called me asking for a Shubert Hearse. Said he didn't care whether it was used. Probably best not to ask any questions. You can usually find Hearses near the church.
21_53_52_0011     //  You know the Walter Coupe? All the kids around town love this car - it's cheap but has some juice under the hood. I got my eye on one actually, my son's just got his license and he should have some nice wheels. Go steal it for me would you?
21_53_52_0021     //  I need a Smith Deluxe Station Wagon. Deluxe? Haha, that's a joke. Looks like a shed on wheels. There isn't a big market for the car itself, but some of the wooden parts have gone out of production so there's some money to be made there.
21_53_52_0031     //  Smith just brought out this new model - the Mainline. It's quite a dull car really, but I can easily offload one onto an unsuspecting housewife at a healthy premium. Pick me one up would you?
21_53_52_0041     //  Here's a great opportunity to earn some dough. Steal a GAI 353 Military Truck and bring it to the garage. Robbing the army is a risky business mind you. Keep an eye out for soldiers guarding the truck.
21_53_53_0001     //  Business is bad, I need to concentrate on upmarket cars. I'm sick of people writing me off as a two-bit joke. Get me a Jefferson Provincial please.
21_53_53_0011     //  You hear that Potomac went out of business? Bad news for them, good news for car traders. They only just launched the Indian - that car's going to be a classic, trust me. If you could lay your hands on one, I'd make it well worth your while.
21_53_53_0021     //  The Quicksilver Windsor is a beast. A lot of weight, but plenty of go under the hood. It's a really classy ride. Just like your mother, haha. Hey - only joking Jimmy, put me down....  I'm looking for a Windsor in good condition, pick one up for me and I'll make sure you get a good payout. And sorry about that little joke back there, it was in poor taste.
21_53_53_0031     //  Can you believe the Walker Rocket? I wouldn't be seen dead in one of those things. Looks like it flew right out of a stupid space movie. Love it or hate it, I have an order here that specifies a Walker Rocket and it's good money. No accounting for taste I suppose.
21_53_53_0041     //  I got something a little spicier than usual, Jimmy. Somebody I know needs a police bus. Don't say nothing to no one about this. He's going to drive it right into the pen to spring a buddy of his and it's all really hush-hush. Dangerous job, but it pays well.
21_53_54_0001     //  Jimmy! Just the guy. You don't need to know the details, but I left a Culver Empire packed with explosives somewhere I shouldn't. Wires got crossed blah, blah, blah.  I need you to go pick it up for me, before well.. you know... KA-BOOM. And drive carefully for God's sake, you'll take half the city with you if that thing goes off!
21_53_54_0011     //  Ah, the Lassiter 69. Good memories. I first banged my third wife in the back my old 69... Now that bitch is asking for it as part of our divorce settlement. I told a few lies to her lawyers, she can't know that I sold that car! I know one with the exact same specs, don't suppose you could steal it for me?
21_53_54_0021     //  You got the balls for a risky job? We need a Smith Custom - a cop car. Don't ask questions, just get me the car.
21_53_54_0031     //  Ah, I got a request for a Houston Wasp - very specific, apparently the guy is a collector. I usually don't handle Houstons,  they remind me of my ex-wife - slow, high-maintenance, humongous trunk. Get this geek off my back would you and steal a Wasp for me?
21_53_54_0041     //  There's a lot of money in haulage, Jimmy. I'm setting up an operation, so I want a rig to get me started. Like the song goes "I need me a Hank B". There's always one sat in the industrial park in North Millville, pick it up for me, would you?
21_53_55_0001     //  The Lassiter Series 75 Hollywood, it's the car that every aspiring businessman wants to be seen in. Jesus, every day I got a couple of morons on the phone wanting that car and ready to pay good money to look good in front of the boss. Pick me up a 75 in good working condition please.
21_53_55_0011     //  The Custom 200 must have made Smith a pretty penny. It might not be much to look at, but everyone seems to be driving one. It's good to have one in stock, if you could drop one off at the garage that would be great.
21_53_55_0021     //  I got a sweet job for you, Jimmy. I need a Shubert Frigate for a friend of mine who's just come into some money. I can fix it up, but I'd rather not. The better condition you deliver the car in, the more money for you. Deal?
21_53_55_0031     //  Shit! I told a guy I would get him a Smith Thunderbolt and I forgot. He's coming over today and well, lets just say I can't afford to piss him off. I don't have time to repair it Jimmy, so try to get it here in good condition - I'll make it worth your while. No - I won't forget to pay up, I promise! I know... I know I can't afford to piss you off either Jimmy. Just get the car, please...
21_53_55_0041     //  Jimmy! Just the man! Listen - I need a Shubert Armored Van. Couple of friends of mine have a big heist planned and they need a bulletproof getaway vehicle. There's a security firm that does a daily run through the city, your only chance will be when the driver stops near the bank. You in?
21_53_56_0001     //  Hey Jimmy - thanks a lot for helping me out. I feel like I kind of owe you something. Tell you what - one of my guys left a Shubert Beverly out in the city this morning. If you pick it up, it's yours. Just watch out for the cops, I think they might be looking for it too.
21_53_56_0011     //  I got a tip for you, Jimmy. Get some decent wheels! Every car you drive is a piece of crap. People judge you on the car you drive, you know. Like the shoes you wear. You probably need some new shoes too, come to think of it. But I'm a car dealer not a... err... shoe... guy. Listen, I know where to find a nice Berkley Kingfisher, go procure it and it's all yours.
21_53_56_0021     //  I don't know what I'd do without you, Jimmy. You really are one in a million. I got some information today on where to find an Ascot Bailey. That's a really classy car. Go take it my friend and keep it for yourself, you earned it.
21_53_56_0031     //  Jimmy! I need a word, man-to-man. You remember you borrowed me that thousand? Well.. Business hasn't been too good recently, I need another few weeks to pay. BUT! Hear me out... Hear me out for just a minute, Jimmy... I know where you can find a sweet ISW 508. That should do for interest right? Thats one of the nicest cars on the road. You steal it and it's all yours. Sound good?
21_53_56_0041     //  Jimmy? It's Tam. Remember how we used to box up at the Hill O'Tara? Well, the Chinese hold a fighting tournament every year called the Golden Fist. The main prize is 1000 bucks and a car. Should be a piece of piss for a big lad like you eh? It would be a real kick in the balls for Eddie Fu as well, which would make me very happy.
21_53_80_0001     //  A riot has broken out in the prison, just like you planned. It's now or never! Run like hell and you'll be out of here. Get moving!
21_53_90_0001     //  You have reached the end of the blood trail. Now to take on the dirtiest bastard of them all: Judge Hillwood, the biggest crook in Empire Bay. He controls the police, the courts... even the gangs. You'll never forget the moment he sent you to jail. Do him justice and send him to hell!
21_53_91_0001     //  Jimmy! Sal. I just spoke to Tam Brodie, he told me you dealt with Eddie Fu. You did a good thing there, Jimmy, a really good thing. Stopped a fucking war. You need to get paid. We'll do the handover in Riverside near the railway bridge. One of my boys is driving there now. He's in a bright red car - a sporty little number. The cash is in the trunk. You can keep the car as well. Thanks again, Jimmy. Come over for dinner sometime, Maria would love to see you!

301042830         //  Get inside, Scaletta! You're gonna die out here!
301042840         //  Scaletta. Get inside, now!
301042850         //  See the gun out on the balcony, Scaletta? Get on it!
301042860         //  Let's go! Get on that machine gun!
301042870         //  If these guys get inside, we're fucked.
301042880         //  Nice shooting, Scaletta!
301042890         //  More of 'em, down by the church.
301042900         //  Take out that truck.
301042901         //  Take out that truck in the far left corner of the square.
301042910         //  By the stall. There, to your right.
301042920         //  Let 'em have it!
301042930         //  On the steps! Right underneath you.
301042940         //  Over there, to the left!
301042950         //  To your right, more of 'em!
301042960         //  Ahhhhh, shit, they got artillery! Get inside, now!
301042970         //  Goddammit! Can't you shoot straight?
301042971         //  Come on! They're running right at ya for Chrissakes!
301042972         //  I seen better shooting in Basic. Aim Goddammit!
301042980         //  Come on, Scaletta, shoot these assholes!
301042990         //  What the hell you waitin' for?! SHOOT!
301042991         //  Come on! Pull the damn trigger!
301042992         //  Scaletta, that weapon fubar, or you just retarded?
301070010         //  n_Tomaso!
301070020         //  n_Christ! My leg.... (sounds of pain and manly groaning)
301070030         //  n_(gasping as if he's been shot in the leg)
301070040         //  f_Pull back, pull back!
301070050         //  f_They have a machine gun in there!
301070060         //  n_(grunts while he pulls Angelo back)
301070070         //  n_Your leg is bleeding quite badly Angelo.... Hold it up if you can.
301330080         //  f_Every single one of you is a traitor.
301330085         //  f_If nobody wants to talk, this man will die. It's so simple. Why, why?
301330090         //  f_One of you will pay. Will it be this man? Will it be you, ha? You? You? Who will it be?
301330095         //  f_It will be this man after all, ha? Ha, you want to die ha, ha?
301330100         //  f_No, no... uh.
301330105         //  f_Such a waste. It could have been avoided.
301330150         //  n_
301330170         //  f_What?! Where did that come from?
301330180         //  f_We're under attack!
301330200         //  f_Shoot the prisoners!
301330230         //  f_At them!
301330240         //  f_Kill the fascists!
301330260         //  f_Vengeance!
301330310         //  f_Kill them all!
301330320         //  f_Come on, son! Shoot them!
302010780         //  So tell me pal, what was it like over there anyway? I kept reading the papers to see what was going on, and you know how much I hate reading...
302010781         //  Yeah, I know.
302010782         //  You guys kicked Mussolini's ass, right?
302010783         //  Ah, sort of... We had a little help from a guy named Don Calo.
302010784         //  No shit! Don Calo... I heard of him!
302010785         //  Really?
302010786         //  You bet. I know guys like him over here. Wiseguys. You work for them, you're set. You fuck with 'em, you die.
302010787         //  Nice to see you been busy!
302010788         //  Yeah, and I heard you got a medal, right?
302010789         //  From Old Man Patton himself.
302010790         //  Whoa, so you're a real war hero, huh! Hahaha... And then what, you screwed a couple of Sicilian broads and came home?
302010791         //  Yeah, right...
302010792         //  Hehehe! The old country. Over here you can screw anything with a heartbeat - No one gives a shit. What a country! Here's to the US of A, and to having you back home.
302011000         //  I should go home. I haven't seen Mamma and Francesca in forever.
302011010         //  First I'll go home, then I can walk around.
302011020         //  Plenty of time to walk around the city later.
302011051         //  Hey, what's the good word?
302011052         //  How you doing, soldier?
302011053         //  Lot better now that I'm home.
302011054         //  You on leave, or home for good?
302011055         //  That's, uh, classified.
302011056         //  So, uh, what's new around here?
302011057         //  Tell the truth, not much. Everybody just wants the war to be over already, and they're saying this is the coldest winter on record. Wish I had some good news for you.
302011058         //  Yeah, you and me both. Alright, I'll see you.
302011059         //  Catch you later, buddy.
302011060         //  Vito!? Is that you?
302011070         //  Vito, don't you remember me?
302011080         //  Vito... Vito, is that you? Vito, is that you?
302011090         //  Uh, hello Misses, uh...
302011100         //  Vito?  It is you! You look so handsome in that uniform. Your mother must be so proud.
302011110         //  Um...
302011120         //  And what about poor Salvatore Montemaggiore, how's he doing? His poor mother was expecting him home a week ago.
302011130         //  Yeah, um, Sal joined the Navy... I'm in the Army. It's different.
302011140         //  Why don't you come inside and have some tea with me, Vito? You could tell me all about it!
302011150         //  Thanks, but I-I'm in kind of a hurry. I just got back and I can't wait to see my mother and Frankie.
302011160         //  Such a pretty girl, that Francesca. It's a wonder she's not married yet. Well, say hello to your mother for me, Vito.
302011390         //  Hey, Vito, look who's back! You're looking pretty good for a guy who just got shot.
302011400         //  Hey, Lisa! How you doing?
302011410         //  Francesca said you were coming back. Finally some good news, huh!
302011420         //  Yeah, no kidding. It's good to be back.
302011430         //  You know, I'm real glad you're alright. Neighborhood just wasn't the same without you.
302011440         //  Well, everything still looks the same around here, including you. So, uh, what are you doing later?
302011450         //  Eh, you know, the usual - cooking dinner for Tony and the kids.
302011470         //  Oh, you got married? Boy, you didn't waste any time, huh?
302011475         //  C'mon, Vito - I'm twenty-one years old here! Of course I'm married with two kids.
302011479         //  Yeah, well, it was real good seeing you. Say hello to your mother for me, will you?
302011480         //  n_Man, I hope those are ours...
302011490         //  n_Course they're ours!
302011500         //  n_Yeah, that's what everybody said when the Japs attacked Pearl Harbor, and look how that ended up.
302011510         //  n_That was Hawaii, dumbass. We're a long way from Japan. Hey, open your eyes - can't you see the stars and stripes?
302011520         //  n_Yeah, yeah, now I see. You got good eyes!
302011525         //  n_Shut the fuck up, Donny!
302011530         //  n_ ...you're always lying  to me. You're still seeing that bitch, I know it! What do you seen in her, anyway?! She's as ugly as your sister!
302011540         //  n_ Stop yelling at me right now!
302011550         //  n_ I hate you!
302011560         //  n_ That vase belonged to my mother!
302011570         //  n_ I couldn't stand her anyway.
302011580         //  n_ Leave my mother out of this!
302011590         //  n_ Get out... Just, pack you stuff and get out!
302011600         //  n_ I've had enough of this, dammit!
302011610         //  n_ Aaah, leave me alone, you bastard.
302011620         //  n_ What are you doing? Leave that here!
302011630         //  n_ I'm taking what's mine and l'm leaving.
302011640         //  n_What's yours? I'm the one who bought it!
302011650         //  n_With whose money? Let me go, I don't want anything to do with you anymore.
302011660         //  n_Go! Go be happy with your ugly whore...
302011670         //  n_Come on, Marie! Let him go!
302011680         //  n_Yeah! We'll be right back!
302011690         //  n_Forget it, you two! He's not going anywhere!
302011700         //  n_It's just one lousy beer! Crazy broad...
302011710         //  n_That's what he said the last time! Then he comes home at three in the morning smelling like gin and another dame's perfume!
302011720         //  n_Hey, Georgie! Come on! You don't gotta listen to everything your old lady says, do you?!
302011730         //  n_George isn't going anywhere! Now scram!
302011740         //  n_Eh heh... That crazy broad's really got Georgie by the balls, huh?
302011750         //  n_Hey, more beer for us, right? Let's go.
302011760         //  Vito? Is that you?
302011770         //  Hey, Mr. Manara... You closing the shop?
302011780         //  Yeah, you know how it is... Can't afford to stay in business no more.
302011790         //  Wow, I'm-I'm sorry.
302011800         //  Eh, well, the war's not your fault, Vito. Who knows? Maybe when the war ends, I'll open up again.
302011820         //  Well, uh, good luck then.
302011830         //  Hey, thanks, kid.
302011840         //  n_
302011850         //  n_ Goddamn chimney!
302011860         //  n_
302011892         //  n_Gas rationing to stop soon!
302011893         //  n_Got your weather forecast: Snow, snow, and more snow!
302012000         //  There it is... Empire Bay. Tell the truth. You miss it?
302012010         //  Hey, does a bear shit in the woods? Not like this place ever done me any favors, but anything's better than a foxhole. What's with this shitty weather?
302012020         //  They're saying this is the coldest winter on record. Papers say it's gonna keep up like this for weeks. Don't worry though, a drink'll warm you right up. How long's it been since we had a drink together, Vito? Two years?
302012030         //  Almost three. Tony Sachelli's party, right?
302012040         //  Come on, Vito, come on.  The last drink we had together was right after your old man's funeral, right before you shipped out.  You remember.
302012050         //  Ah, five minutes, we're already talking about my deadbeat father.  Can we change the subject please?
302012060         //  Alright, pal, sorry, you got it.
302012070         //  Alright, so where we headed?
302012080         //  I was thinking we'd head down to Freddy's for old times' sake.
302012090         //  You still hang out at that dump?
302012100         //  It's under new ownership now. You should see the place. Got a whole different kind of clientele these days. You'll see.
302012110         //  Yeah?  And would this new clientele have anything to do with this car you're driving?
302012120         //  Let's just say that a number of opportunities have presented themselves since you been away. What'd you expect me to go straight after you left?
302012130         //  Course not.  Although without me here to keep you out of trouble, I half expected you to be locked up when I got back.
302012140         //  What are you, nuts?  Not this guy, chief.  I'm a little too smart for that.
302012150         //  Either that or you had a horseshoe up your ass.
302020011         //  Frankie, that was delicious. Now I could really use some sleep.
302020021         //  Yes Vito, you look tired. You should get some sleep. Your room is just like you left it.
302020022         //  I'll see you two in the morning.
302020023         //  Sleep well, mio bambino.
302020024         //  Goodnight, Vito.
302020100         //  Who could that be?
302020110         //  I'll go see who it is.
302020120         //  Wow Mamma, this place looks exactly the same!
302020150         //  Ahh... much better. How do I look, Mamma?
302020160         //  Comfortable, but not as nice. When you get a job, you go buy yourself a nice suit, huh?
302020280         //  This ain't gonna cut it, I gotta find a place to stay.
302020500         //  n_C'mon, junior, I'm gonna take you to school!
302020501         //  n_Stop, stop please. Vito, what are you doing?
302020502         //  n_Please, Vito, this isn't your problem.
302020503         //  n_You'll get yourself into more trouble, Vito.
302020510         //  n_Vito, please, you're making it even worse.
302020520         //  n_Oh, tough guy, scaring a woman, huh?! C'mon, show me what you got!
302020530         //  n_Do you have any idea who you're fucking with, you schmuck?
302020540         //  n_Yeah... The guy who's getting his ass kicked!
302021140         //  How are you, mio bambino? It must have been so terrible. I was so afraid. I prayed for you every day.
302021150         //  I'm OK, ma. I drove a jeep most of the time... Sometimes I had to fight.
302021240         //  Uh, so how you two been? Franny, what you been up to?
302021250         //  I still live here with Mamma. I got a nice office job. It pays the bills, and I started paying off some of Papa's debts.
302021260         //  Francesca, we don't want to talk about that now...
302021270         //  So, uh, you got a boyfriend yet?
302021280         //  Not yet.
302021290         //  What's the hurry? The boys in the neighborhood these days are not so good. She'll meet the right man one day.
302030010         //  Excuse me, ma'am? Um, do you know where Joe Barbaro lives?
302030020         //  To the right of the stairs. And tell him that racket last night has to stop. If he don't like it he can find another place to live.
302030100         //  n_Is it fixed yet?
302030110         //  n_It's the same as when you asked me ten seconds ago.
302030120         //  n_Oh for crying out loud...
302030130         //  n_What the hell's the matter with you now?
302030140         //  n_It's taking you forever and I'm cold.
302030150         //  n_So sit in the damn car if you're cold.
302030160         //  n_It's cold in the car too! Hurry up and fix this piece of junk.
302030170         //  n_It'd get done a hell of a lot quicker if you quit nagging me and gave me a hand.
302030180         //  n_I am not nagging you!
302030190         //  n_Yeah... uh huh? Well if you were as good with a wrench as you were with your mouth, we could have this damn thing fixed already.
302030200         //  n_Ugh! You are so useless... It's no wonder the Army wouldn't take you.
302030210         //  n_Ugh! You had to bring that up again, didn't you!
302030220         //  n_Ethel's husband Frank, he's a fighter pilot. Margaret's husband Charlie, he drives a submarine...
302030230         //  n_I'm warning you...
302030240         //  n_My husband? Oh, he's a four-F. He works at the grocery store.
302030250         //  n_Ugh, you know what? Fix it yourself then, you lousy bitch!
302030260         //  Hey, need a hand?
302030270         //  Sure do. Hope you're better at this thing than my good-for-nothing husband.
302030280         //  Here we go, all done. I just needed to, uh, screw a couple things in.
302030290         //  Really? Well, thank you very much, handsome.
302030300         //  Don't mention it.
302030310         //  Hey, tough guy, what are you staring at, huh? Mind your own business - keep walking!
302030320         //  You got shit in your ears? Get the fuck out of here!
302030330         //  Oh, we got a hero here, huh? Bring it on!
302030340         //  Bad decision, asshole.
302030420         //  I should go to Joe's.
302030430         //  I better head over to Joe's place.
302030440         //  I really gotta go see Joe. He'll know what to do.
302040010         //  Come on, we'll take my car.
302040140         //  Fuck! Now the cops are after us!
302040160         //  Lose 'em, fast!
302040170         //  Lose those cops, numbnuts!
302040180         //  You hear me? Get rid of those cops!
302040190         //  I ain't exactly on the best of terms with these guys you know. Lose 'em!
302040240         //  You made enough cash for all this in the last three years?
302040250         //  More like the last three months. I barely had time to furnish the place.
302040260         //  Three months? Holy shit...
302040270         //  You just gotta know the right people. And you're all set, 'cause you know me.
302040280         //  Hey, uh, thanks again for the thing with the discharge papers.
302040290         //  Hey, all I did was make a phone call. You can thank Giuseppe when we go pick 'em up.
302040330         //  So you thought about what you gonna do now?
302040350         //  No no no no... I meant, you know, the big picture. When you was over there, didn't you think about what you was gonna do when you got back?
302040360         //  Not really... well... besides the usual. You know. Find a nice girl, settle down...
302040370         //  Whoa... hey, there's gonna be plenty of time for that shit later. Right now, I'm gonna make sure you live a little.
302040371         //  Haha, yeah... Sounds good to me.
302040380         //  Go ahead, there's plenty of hot water.
302040390         //  Jeez, this place is like a damn palace.
302040400         //  Hehehe, I'm glad you like it. You can stay as long as you want, pal.
302040410         //  Whoa! Look at this bed!
302040411         //  Hey, this is Joe's bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
302040412         //  I'm sleeping on the couch in the kitchen.  Why there's a couch in the kitchen, I have no fuckin' idea.
302040413         //  I missed Joe when I was overseas, but uhh not that much.
302040420         //  Hey-hey-hey, oh, hey! I don't know how you did things in the Army, but here it's only one man to a bed, alright?
302040430         //  What are you, kidding me? After seeing the two broads that just left, I wouldn't touch that thing if you paid me...
302040440         //  Hey, whyo, who's this skinny guy in the picture?
302040450         //  Hehehe... That was back in '41.
302040460         //  Ah, you haven't changed at all. You know, in the face.
302040470         //  Hehehe, fuck you. The good life will do that to you.
302040480         //  We did a lot of stupid shit back then, huh?
302040490         //  Yeah, just wasn't the same after you left.
302040500         //  Hey, it wasn't exactly a picnic for me either, you know.
302040510         //  Yeah, I bet. But hey, all that's gonna change now that you're back.
302040520         //  Look at this! You got your own phone?!
302040530         //  Yeah, and now you do too. Can't do business without it these days.
302040540         //  Must be nice to be able to make a call without having to leave your apartment.
302040550         //  It is, but it ain't fun when the damn thing wakes you up in the middle of the night. Can you imagine if you had to walk around with one of these things all day? I'd go out of my fucking mind.
302040560         //  This where I'm gonna sleep?
302040570         //  Yup, all yours.
302040580         //  I'll rest later.
302040590         //  No time to sleep now.
302040600         //  Hot water, hmmm. I could get used to this...
302040610         //  Look at that... it comes out right out of the tap...
302040620         //  Come on, you ain't gonna earn any money just standing here.
302040630         //  Hey, you ready to go or what?
302040640         //  Vito, c'mon, let's go already.
302040700         //  Hey, uh, you think I could uh...
302040710         //  What - drive Vito? The roads are icy, and you ain't never drove a car before.
302040720         //  Joe, I was driving almost the whole time I was over there!
302040730         //  Yeah, but this ain't no tank, Vito. This is one of the nicest cars money can buy...
302040740         //  I didn't drive a tank, I drove a jeep.
302040750         //  What the hell's a jeep?
302040751         //  It's a... never mind. You gonna let me drive or what?
302040752         //  Alright, alright here's the keys. Just be fucking careful.
302040760         //  Alright, when it's cold as fuck outside, you gotta give it a little more gas than usual. That's the pedal over there on the right...
302040770         //  I know, Joe, I know...
302040780         //  What'd you say you drove over there? A "jeep?" Them European cars are totally different.
302040790         //  It's an American military car... truck... thing. Agh... never mind.
302040800         //  Hey, whoa whoa whoa! Slow it down a bit! No need to get pulled over for no reason.
302040850         //  The quickest way is through the tunnel, so take a left up here.
302040860         //  Then just go straight for a while.
302040861         //  Alright, now go left.
302040864         //  Take a left up here.
302040869         //  Go left right up here.
302040870         //  You mind if we go the long way?
302040876         //  Take a right.
302040879         //  Go right here.
302040880         //  Since we already are, you might as well just keep going. Just make sure you head north. We gotta cross the river to get to Mike's.
302040881         //  Go right up here.
302040884         //  Hey turn around, we're going the wrong way!
302040892         //  Hey, take it easy where the road curves up here.  Couple of weeks ago some guy went right through the damn guardrail and drowned in the water.
302040900         //  OK, now make a right here.
302040930         //  Are we going to Mike's or what? You can go for a joyride once you get your own car.
302040940         //  Alright, almost there. Make a right up here.
302040950         //  I'm kind of afraid to tell you this, but you can go a lot faster if you get on the highway. We'll get there a lot quicker, if you don't kill us.
302040960         //  Whoa! Are you nuts? You're going the wrong way!
302041010         //  Oh, shit. Uh, that'll... that'll buff right out.
302041020         //  Yeah, good driver my ass. Pull over and let me drive.
302041030         //  Na, na na... C'mon, don't worry, I got it all under control...
302041031         //  Yeah... you better.
302041040         //  Shit! Sorry.
302041050         //  Hey! I told you, this ain't no tank! Be careful!
302041051         //  Alright alright... sorry.
302041060         //  Dammit Vito! What the hell are you doing!?
302041070         //  Sorry Joe, won't happen again.
302041080         //  Yeah, better not!...
302041090         //  Argh... I'm definitely gonna have to take this thing to Charlie later.
302041100         //  Charlie, Charlie who?
302041110         //  I'll introduce you to him later. Right now just concentrate on the damn road!
302041115         //  Fuck! You see!? I told you you'd wreck it.
302041116         //  Argh... we gotta fix this thing...
302041117         //  Take it easy.  I'll take a look at it... Can't be too much different than a jeep, right?
302041120         //  Uh... this might take a while...
302041130         //  Terrific Vito. Smack it up some more and might as well just leave it at the fucking junkyard when we get there.
302041170         //  Whoa!
302041180         //  Argh... you idiot...
302041300         //  You giving up? Haha, don't worry, you'll learn to drive someday. Now get back in so you don't get runned over out there.
302041310         //  Hey, whoa! Where are you going? We ain't there yet!
302041320         //  Hey Vito, if you don't want to drive no more, just say so. No need to get your balls all twisted here.
302041340         //  You know what? You're hopeless. That's it, I'm just gonna wait here 'til you come to your senses.
302041350         //  You know, you wasn't kidding. They really taught you to drive over there. At least something good come out of it.
302041360         //  You know, you really wasn't too bad behind the wheel. You could still use a little practice, though.
302041365         //  That's Mike's junkyard there. Just drive through the gate.
302041370         //  Jesus Christ. We're lucky we got here in one piece...
302041375         //  I don't got time to walk around.  I got a job to do.
302041376         //  I gotta get moving.  Joe's waiting for me.
302041500         //  So, uhh, what's the story with Bruski?
302041510         //  Mike's a good guy to know. He's a little grouchy, but he's always got a scam going. He deals with stolen cars mostly. Spent some time inside a while back, I heard he used to stick up gas stations back in the day.
302041520         //  You gonna make him pay the cleaning bill for your jacket?
302041530         //  Na, I'll let that one slide. I do a lot of business with the guy, plus he's got one hell of a temper. One time we was at the track and some mick spilled a beer on his win ticket.  Mike beat the shit out of him 'til he went blind in one eye.  For a lousy ten bucks... Would you believe that shit?
302041540         //  Sounds like kind of a scumbag.
302041550         //  Hey, you just gotta know how to handle these people. And Mike's a pussycat compared to some of the guys I met since you shipped out. You'll see.
302050020         //  You know where the bar is?
302050100         //  You know, once in a while Mike finds a body stuck in the press here.
302050110         //  No shit?
302050120         //  Na, na, I'm just kidding. People who cause trouble get thrown off the pier.
302050130         //  Wiseass.
302050170         //  I think I took this joke far enough.
302050180         //  Probably not a good idea.
302050190         //  This car is Joe's baby. First he'd cry... and then he'd kill me.
302050200         //  Jeez, look at these things...
302050210         //  How much you think a car like this goes for?
302050220         //  'Ey, don't worry about that, we're gonna get you something a hell of a lot better than an old scachabong.
302050230         //  I don't think I can afford anything better.
302050240         //  Who says you're gonna pay for it? Now c'mon, let's get to work.
302050250         //  Hey, what the hell are you doing in there? You got work to do.
302050260         //  Hey, Joe... Why don't you teach your buddy some manners here?
302050270         //  Vito, stop fucking around! C'mon, we gotta go!
302050271         //  Sorry about that, Mike. He's been a little stunad ever since he come back from the war, a capiche?
302050280         //  I told you what you gotta do. What else you wanna know?
302050300         //  Look, I need one Walter coupé - what do you want me to do, write it down for you? And don't go bringing the cops here!
302050310         //  Hey, you don't gotta worry about me. I'll make sure nobody follows me back here.
302050320         //  Good, 'cause the last guy who brung the cops here ended up in the press...
302050330         //  So, uh, after I'm done, you think you're gonna have another job for me?
302050340         //  Yeah, we'll see. Now get going.
302050400         //  Alright, go out the way we came in and get on the main highway going west. Don't go back through the city.
302050410         //  Turn around, it's the other way. It's gonna be three times longer this way.
302050430         //  So how's it feel to be back?
302050440         //  Good. I'd feel a lot better with some money in my pocket.
302050450         //  Hey what's the rush? Money don't buy you happiness you know...
302050460         //  ...Get the fuck out of here.
302050470         //  Ah, I was just fucking with you... Don't worry about the money. This little job is just the beginning. Pretty soon you'll be rolling in it.
302050540         //  Hey, where the hell you going?
302050550         //  What do you need? Some fresh air? Come on, we ain't got all fucking day, you know...
302050560         //  Stop being a jerkoff and get back in the car! You got a job to do!
302050581         //  Wow, I forgot how nice this neighborhood was.  You know something - one of these days, I'm gonna buy a house here.
302050582         //  Look at this guy.  Ain't even back a day and he's too good for his old neighborhood...
302050583         //  Hey, what're you breaking my balls for - I'm just window shopping.  It'd be years before I could afford a place like this.
302050584         //  Haha.  You got champagne taste and beer pockets, my friend... don't worry though, I'm gonna help you change that.
302060010         //  What you staring at, white boy? Can't you see we busy here?
302060020         //  Somebody in the wrong part of town.
302060030         //  You deaf? This here's our turf, and you're ain't welcome. Vamoose, greaseball.
302060040         //  You keep messing with us, and then you gonna have to deal with the Bombers.
302060050         //  OK, now you done it, motherfucker!
302060060         //  Now we gonna beat your lily-white ass!
302060061         //  Can't leave here without the car.
302060062         //  I gotta get that car.  I cannot afford to fuck this up.
302060063         //  I gotta leave here in that car, not on my feet.
302060064         //  Can't go running away now.  I got a job to do.
302060070         //  Motherfucker! That asshole's stealing my car! You believe this shit?
302060071         //  Get the fuck away from my ride!
302060072         //  Crazy-ass white boy done broke my window!
302060073         //  Hey! Hey what you doing motherfucker!
302060074         //  You done gone and messed with the wrong niggas now, boy.
302060080         //  Now we're gonna beat your lily-white ass.
302060081         //  Yo! What the fuck you think you doing to my car!?
302060082         //  Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy fellas. I, uh... I guess I got the wrong car.
302060083         //  You damn right you did!
302060120         //  What's up? Where's the car?
302060150         //  Hey Vito, don't come back without the car.
302060160         //  Where's the car?
302060200         //  I better get moving. Joe's waiting for me.
302060210         //  I'll look around later. I need to make some cash first.
302070041         //  Hey, who's that guy back there?
302070042         //  What guy?
302070043         //  The guy at the body shop.
302070044         //  Oh, Tommy. He's my buddy's nephew. He's kinda quiet, but let me tell you, the kid's some hell of a dancer. Saw him at the old dance hall in Oyster Bay a couple of weeks ago. He had all the broads going nuts.
302070045         //  Do I detect a hint of, uh, jealousy?
302070046         //  Are you kidding? I don't need no dance moves. I got charm, my friend. Here, I'll give you some of my lines, so maybe you won't have to spend so many nights with Rosie Palm and her five sisters.
302070047         //  Hey, here's one. Hey, is that a mirror in your pocket?  'Cos I can see myself in your pants.
302070048         //  Ah here, I got another one. If I could rearrange the alphabet I'd put U and I together.
302070049         //  Or this one never fails. Hey, baby, that's a nice outfit. It would look good crumpled up at the foot of my bed in the morning.
302070050         //  Welcome to Giuseppe's General Store, a thieves' paradise... You name it, he's got it. He even sells phony gun permits and discharge papers for guys tired of getting their asses shot off...
302070051         //  Aww, here, here's a good one. Hey, do you know the difference between sex and conversation? No? You wanna go back to my place and talk?
302070052         //  How about this one? Why don't we go back to my place and play house? You'll be the door and I'll slam you.
302070053         //  Oh, that was bad.
302070055         //  Hey, when you measure seven soft, you don't have to be good with words, you get my drift?
302070060         //  Uh, we need a set of lock picks, too.
302070070         //  That we do. And guess who's paying for them.
302070080         //  What, you don't got enough dough? Alright, Giuseppe, I'll cover the rest.
302070089         //  See you around, Giuseppe. Sia benedica.
302070090         //  Alright, now let's get down to business.
302070147         //  Ha, ha, ha.
302070148         //  Oh, oh, come on.
302070149         //  And this works for you?
302070151         //  You got problems, you know that?
302070360         //  So, uh, if I got a car I want to get rid of...
302070370         //  Yeah, just bring it by and I'll take it off your hands if I can. And I'll make it worth your while.
302070380         //  Sorry Vito, but I gotta take a look at this Coupe you just brought me.
302070390         //  Your buddy Joe's more impatient than usual today. I'd get moving if I was you.
302070400         //  Sorry kid, I got work to do right now. I'll see you later.
302070476         //  You should take the highway, Vito.
302070480         //  Alright, you pulled off that job without fucking it up. Nice going.
302070490         //  Yeah but I almost got my ass kicked.  I didn't live through the war just to die in Sand Island.
302070500         //  Hey, that's all part of the deal, pal. Take it or leave it. Besides, it ain't like you're qualified for anything else.
302070510         //  Ah, I guess you're right...
302070520         //  Don't worry about it. It's all gonna be a piece of cake.
302071300         //  Grazie. You can test it right now. Here, take this lock. You just need to insert the pick into the lock and lift all the pins. You use the wrench to hold the pins one by one. When all of the pins are set, just turn the wrench and the lock, she opens. Easy.
302071310         //  Easy, huh?
302071320         //  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. I do it all the time when I lock my keys in the car.
302080460         //  Alright, Mamma said I should go see a Derek Papalardo down at the port. I should head down there.
302090010         //  Eh, follow me.
302090020         //  Load this pile of crates onto that truck.
302090021         //  When you're done, you get ten bucks. If something gets lost or broken, you get nothing. Start now and don't take all day.
302090030         //  Oh, yeah, this is gonna be a lot of fun... Who the fuck wants to move boxes around all goddamn day?
302090040         //  Jeez, all this for ten lousy bucks? You gotta be kidding me...
302090050         //  Aw, how can these guys stand this? I'm doing this for five fucking minutes, I already hate it...
302090060         //  You know what? I don't need this chickenshit money!
302090070         //  Yeah, hey, it's better than lugging crates around.
302090080         //  Na, sounds like too much aggravation to me.
302090085         //  Smart fucking kid.
302090090         //  All right then, get going.
302090100         //  Your choice. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
302100010         //  You change your mind?
302100020         //  Oh yeah, I got this guy already.
302100030         //  This guy already paid.
302100040         //  I got his money already.
302100050         //  Ahem, I'm here to collect the fee for the barber.
302100060         //  Hey, pal. Derek needs you to pay the fee for the barber.
302100070         //  Hey, Derek needs you to pay the fee for the barber.
302100080         //  Thanks, appreciate your cooperation.
302100090         //  Next time try to pay on time, OK? Thanks.
302100100         //  Don't leave it 'til the last minute next time.
302100110         //  Sure, here it is, I-I don't want no problems.
302100120         //  Oh, yeah, I must have forgot or something.
302100170         //  I was just coming to pay. Actually, he's pretty good barber.
302100190         //  Again?! I don't even go to the damn barber. Here, you give it to the robbing son of a bitch.
302100220         //  What do I have to use a fucking barber for?
302100221         //  He'll spit on your head and make it shine. What do you want me to say?
302100222         //  Yeah, sure. Here you go, but tell Derek I should be getting a fucking discount.
302100240         //  You got the wrong guy, pal. My wife cuts my hair.
302100250         //  Yeah, that's sweet, but while you work here, you'll get a haircut when Derek says.
302100255         //  Yeah, we'll have to see about that now, won't we?
302100260         //  OK, OK, enough already! Here's your fucking money.
302100270         //  Yeah, glad you decided to reconsider.
302100280         //  You ain't getting shit from me!
302100290         //  I told you, you ain't getting shit, man! Not a fucking dime!
302100300         //  Hey, I already paid!
302100310         //  Don't fuck with me!
302100320         //  I swear to God, I did.
302100330         //  Yeah, and I swear to God I'm gonna kick the shit out of you!
302100340         //  Uh you can't do that!
302100350         //  Oh, yes I can.
302100360         //  Fine, fine, tough guy, here's your fucking money.
302100420         //  Hey, what kind of game are you playing here?!
302100430         //  The kind where you pay what you owe and you don't get hurt. You got a problem with that?
302100440         //  I got a problem with you. Now get out of here before I kick your ass.
302100450         //  I told you, get the fuck out of here!
302100451         //  Here's your fucking money.
302100540         //  n_Kick his ass!
302100550         //  n_Kill 'im!
302100560         //  n_Crack his skull!
302100570         //  n_Kill that motherfucker!
302100580         //  n_Kick the shite out of him!
302100590         //  n_Yeah! Teach him a fucking lesson!
302100600         //  n_Watch it!
302100610         //  n_Get him, get him!
302100620         //  n_Watch out!
302100630         //  n_Whoop his ass!
302100640         //  n_Tear him a new one!
302100650         //  n_Oh, that's got to hurt!
302100660         //  n_Get him, get him! Beat his fucking brains out!
302100661         //  n_I'm gonna kick your little ass!
302100662         //  n_You're gonna regret this, you son of a bitch!
302100663         //  n_You still want your fucking money? Over my dead body!
302100664         //  n_Fuck!
302100665         //  n_God...dammit!
302100666         //  n_Yeah! Feels good, don't it?
302100670         //  Okay, anybody else... got a fucking problem with paying for the fucking barber?!
302100680         //  Shit. Let's get back to work.
302100690         //  Poor Bill. At least he took a stand.
302140250         //  You should get some sleep. Your room is just like you left it.
302140260         //  I'll see you two in the morning.
302140270         //  Sleep well, mio bambino.
302140290         //  You said you were gonna introduce me to that guy Giuseppe.
302140380         //  Hey Vito, you know what time it is?
302140390         //  It's daytime, how the fuck should I know?
302140391         //  It's time for you to get your own fucking car.
302140392         //  Yeah, I'd love to if I could afford one.
302140400         //  Who says you're gonna pay for it?
302140450         //  Ooh, get a load of that baby.
302140460         //  Nice, that's a '42 Jefferson.
302140470         //  Beautiful car like that, it'd be a shame to smash the window.  You should grab yourself some lock picks over at Guiseppe's.
302140500         //  Okay, you still feel like snagging that car?
302140510         //  You kidding me? Absolutely.
302140520         //  Well here's your chance.
302140521         //  Maybe you should take it for a test drive.
302140530         //  Shit, cops.  Come on, come on, get in.
302140540         //  Step on it!
302140550         //  Go, go for Christ's sake!
302140560         //  Oh fuck, that was close.
302140570         //  Yeah, well, it's not over yet!
302140580         //  Lose 'em, quick!
302140590         //  Lose 'em, so's we can hide some place!
302140600         //  Ah shit, I told you to step on it!
302140610         //  Alright. Looks like we lost him.
302140620         //  So how do ya like the car?
302140630         //  Not too bad. I think I'll keep it.
302140640         //  Alright, let's go find ourselves a body shop.  They provide the kind of services we're looking for.
302140641         //  Hey, that don't sound cheap.
302140642         //  Don't worry about it. I got it covered.
302140650         //  Alright, where is he?
302140690         //  Just find any body shop. I know the guy who runs 'em.
302140700         //  Here, park right here in front of the garage door.
302140710         //  Okay, now honk your horn.
302140711         //  Here's some cash so's you can do up your new car, Vito.
302140712         //  This'd be a good time to get the engine tuned up.
302140713         //  You should get some new tires, this thing's rolling on baloney skins.
302140714         //  Might as well get a new set of tires, you was skidding all over the place out there.
302140715         //  You might want to put some better brakes on this thing.
302140716         //  Give it a new paintjob and nobody'll recognize it.
302140717         //  Change the plates, cops won't suspect a thing.
302140718         //  Repaint this thing and change the plates so the car don't get recognized.
302140719         //  OK, now the car's clean.
302140720         //  Ah shit, the cops already made you.
302140721         //  Hey, thanks.
302140722         //  Don't get used to it. Buy me a beer sometime and we'll call it even.
302140723         //  Before we leave, let's get the engine tuned.
302140730         //  One way you could trick 'em is by changing your clothes.
302140740         //  Let's find a clothing store so's we can get you some new threads.
302140750         //  Once you change your clothes, the cops won't recognize you.
302140760         //  Alright, next you should introduce yourself to Mike Bruski.  He'll probably have some work for you.
302140770         //  Alright, where is he?
302140780         //  He owns a junk yard over in Riverside.  You can't miss it.
302140850         //  Here we go.
302140870         //  Fuck.  I better get out of here.
302140880         //  Alright, let's go home, I'm exhausted.
302140910         //  Hey, is there a safe place to park around here?  I don't want to leave this thing out in the street.
302140920         //  Yeah, that's why you're parking your car next to mine in the garage.  The streets are full of criminals these days.
302140930         //  Yeah, the neighborhood ain't what it used to be, huh?
302141000         //  So... Sand Island still the same shithole it was when I left?
302141010         //  No no, the place actually ain't too bad now.
302141020         //  No shit... How the hell'd that happen?
302141030         //  All the moolies flew south for the winter.
302141040         //  Of course, it's still a shithole, Vito.  You only been gone a couple years. Gonna take a lot longer than that for THAT neighborhood to turn around. Them people multiply like rabbits.  What are you gonna do.
302141050         //  It's even worse than when we was kids. They even got some kind of gang there now.  What's their fuckin' name uh... the Beamers, the Boomers, something like that, I don't fuckin' know.
302141060         //  Oh, that's just fucking great...
302141070         //  Hey, what are you worried about?  They're animals. All they do is sell dope and kill each other.  They ain't gonna bother a guy like you.  And even if they do, that's why I gave you that pistol.
302141080         //  Oh by the way - you're carrying a gun now?  What's the deal with that?
302141090         //  Can't do business without it these days.  Especially in this fuckin' neighborhood.
302141100         //  You uh, really know how to inspire confidence, you know that?
302141110         //  And Vito, I almost forgot.
302141120         //  Joe called, he wants you should meet him at Freddy's.
302141202         //  Hey Vito! See if you can hit the gas tank.
302141203         //  Hey! Aim for the wreck, asshole.
302141204         //  Ha! I thought you dagos knew how to shoot.
302141205         //  Hey if he was a Polack he'd be holding the gun backwards.
302141206         //  Fuck you, wiseguy...
302141207         //  You better work on your aim there, chief.
302141208         //  Hey, what are you blind?
302141209         //  Jeez Louise... You couldn't hit the side of a barn.
302141210         //  Hey, I need some more ammo.
302141211         //  Hey. What'd Joe here teach you how to shoot?
302141212         //  Hey easy. He's just a little rusty.
302141213         //  Ah shit, did I leave gas in that thing?
302141214         //  There's a Polack joke there but I'll leave it alone.
302141215         //  Oh yeah, that reminds me... Fuck you.
302141220         //  Of course you do. Here you go.
302141230         //  Hey, you ain't a bad shot.
302141240         //  Nice Vito, nice.
302141250         //  Alright, that's enough shootin', we got work to do.
302141260         //  Hey, what the fuck you doing here?
302141270         //  Hey, man. You ain't welcome here. You better ... leave.
302141280         //  Hey, what the fuck are you doing over there?
302141290         //  Ah, shit.
302141300         //  Let's teach this fuck a lesson!
302141310         //  Hey, what's going on out here?!
302141320         //  Kill that mother fucker!
302141400         //  Here we are.
302141401         //  All right, thanks. Keep the change.
303010011         //  n_Hey! Turn that down in there!
303010013         //  n_Decent people are trying to sleep, dammit!
303010014         //  n_If you don't turn that crap down, I'm gonna call the cops!
303010015         //  n_Hey! Turn it off, or I'll kick your damn door down and I'll do it myself!
303010060         //  Oh, hi there.
303010070         //  What's the matter? Nothing good on the radio?
303010080         //  Mind your beeswax, kid...
303010470         //  Joe and I have some business to discuss.
303010472         //  I told you what you gotta do, now go do it. Go see Maria.
303020320         //  OK, let's go. And take it easy behind the wheel, alright? I seen the way you kids drive these days.
303020322         //  Turn left here.
303020323         //  Make a right.
303020324         //  Hey, slow it down, will you?
303020325         //  What the hell are you doing!
303020326         //  What are you doing, you maniac!?
303020327         //  You're some kind of lunatic, you know that?
303020328         //  What are you on drugs?
303020329         //  Slow it down, I ain't in a rush!
303020332         //  I said slow down. We gotta get there in one piece, you know?
303020333         //  You better stop and pay the ticket, kid.
303020334         //  See? That's what you get for driving like a maniac...
303020335         //  Alright kid... the place is locked up pretty tight at night, so you gotta get in through the back.
303020336         //  They keep the back door open at night?
303020337         //  No, but the basement window usually is, so that's how you can get in.
303020338         //  And if you need to, you can use the bathroom window on the way out.
303020339         //  You're looking for the safe, right?
303020341         //  Yeah, how'd you know?
303020342         //  Lucky guess.  It's on the top floor. So's the Director's office. That's where the keys are.
303020343         //  OK, so I go in through a window round the back, and then head upstairs to the Director's office, right?
303020344         //  Right. And be careful, there's guards in there at night. Don't let 'em see you.
303020345         //  If they do you're gonna be in deep shit.
303020346         //  Alright kid, drop me at the hospital right here.
303020347         //  The office is across the street.
303020348         //  Oh, great... you better pull over kid.
303020349         //  Hey - leadfoot, take it easy! My sister ain't going nowhere.
303020351         //  Are you nuts!?
303020410         //  OK, thanks for the ride, kid.
303020420         //  Thanks Maria, I'll see you.
303020430         //  Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
303020440         //  You're gonna kill the both of us! Be careful!
303020450         //  Kids these days...
303030300         //  n_Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it. Now, pipe down while I finish my puzzle.
303030310         //  n_Ah, raspberries... I'm gonna go make the rounds.
303030320         //  n_Good riddance to you.
303030330         //  n_You got any plans for the weekend?
303030340         //  n_Yeah, gonna relax and watch me some "television."
303030350         //  n_Well, you bought a television?!
303030360         //  n_I sure did!
303030370         //  n_Man, those things cost as much as a car! How the hell did you afford it?
303030380         //  n_Mary's Uncle Lou passed away a few months back, left us some cash.
303030390         //  n_And you bought yourself a television with it...
303030400         //  n_That's what I did! You ought to see this thing. Seven-inch black and white screen. Gets all three channels...
303030410         //  n_Wow, sounds fascinating.
303030420         //  n_What, you mean you ain't gonna get one?
303030430         //  n_I'll stick with my newspaper and with my radio, thank you very much. This "television" is just a fad.
303030440         //  n_We'll see about that, sonny boy.
303030450         //  n_Yeah, so what does Mary think of it?
303030460         //  n_She uh... she ain't seen it yet.
303030470         //  n_Ohhh, hoho! This is getting better by the minute...
303030480         //  n_Uh, she's been visting her mother upstate...
303030490         //  n_Oh yeah, I see. And uh, what've you been watching on that fancy television set of yours?
303030500         //  n_Mostly cartoons. They ain't got much on right now, on account of the war.
303030510         //  n_Cartoons. All that money to watch some cartoons. Hmph, man.
303030520         //  n_Salesman said that when the war's over, they're supposed to start showing ball games on it too.
303030530         //  n_Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
303030540         //  n_But listen, I was watching them cartoons, and it gave me an idea.
303030550         //  n_Oh, here we go. OK, Einstein, let's hear it.
303030560         //  n_Uh, listen to this  - what if... you could control the cartoon?
303030570         //  n_What do you mean?
303030580         //  n_You know, control it. You could make the little guy on the screen do things. You could make 'im run around, drive a car... Maybe even, uh, have him shoot a gun... shoot things with it!
303030590         //  n_Hey, you been sniffing glue? How the hell they gonna do that?
303030600         //  n_Listen, I ain't worked that out yet. Look, you'd probably have to have some sort of box with buttons on it that controls the guy on the screen. I mean, one button would make him walk, the other would make him shoot, one would maybe make him...
303030610         //  n_Oh yeah, that's your brilliant idea, huh? That sounds interesting, but it ain't never gonna happen.
303030620         //  n_Oh yeah? I'm sure someone'll figure it out someday. And you can mark my words on that!
303030630         //  n_Uh huh, sure they will - right after they put a guy on the moon! Hehe.
303030640         //  n_Yeah, yeah... Alright, I'm gonna get back to my crossword puzzle here.
303030650         //  n_Yeah, alright, don't hurt yourself with that no. 2 pencil.
303030670         //  Hey, call the cops! Somebody broke in!... Then get over here, quick!
303030710         //  Show your face, you sissy.
303030720         //  Freeze! Put your hands up or I swear to God I'll plug you!
303030730         //  Put your hands up, and get on the ground, now!
303030740         //  Shoot the bastard!
303030750         //  Wally, are you OK? Talk to me!
303030760         //  I was doing my puzzle... next thing I know, you... waking me up. My head... oh...
303030770         //  Aw shit... looks like somebody beaned you pretty good. I'll call the cops, then we'll go look for the guy. He's gotta be around here somewhere.
303030780         //  If I get my hands on that bastard, he's dead meat.
303030790         //  Hey, Police Department? This is the night watchman over at the OPA. We got a break-in over here.
303030800         //  You're on your way? OK, we'll keep them busy 'til you get here!
303030810         //  Hey, what's going on? Why so quiet? Couldn't shut you up a minute ago!...
303030820         //  Hey, this ain't funny. Say something!
303030830         //  I'm on my way over there and if this is another one of your stupid jokes, I swear to God, I'll box your ears off.
303030840         //  Damn kid's probably just waiting to jump out and scare me. Last time he did that, he damn near gave me a heart attack.
303030850         //  Hey, you OK? What the hell happened? I thought you were just joking around or something...
303030860         //  Argh... does it look like I'm joking? Some bastard snuck up on me and whacked me on the head!
303030870         //  Christ! OK, you stay here. I'll go get the cops and then we'll look for him.
303030880         //  I'm seeing stars... damn that hurts. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Jack Dempsey... My head's fucking killing me!
303030900         //  OK, this is the Director's office.  This is where the key should be.
303030910         //  Alright, here's the Director's office.  This is where Maria said the key was...
303030915         //  Alright, here's the key... now I gotta get to the safe.
303030920         //  Ah, there we go... Jackpot.
303030925         //  Alright, time to blow this joint...
303030930         //  Shit, I need the key to open it. Maria said it was in the Director's office...

303040020         //  Let's go! Tick tock, Vito, get moving!
303040030         //  Hey, what'd I just say? You gotta get rid of 'em by midnight or you get nothing.
303050010         //  Hey, uh, I got some "extra" gas stamps. You interested?
303050020         //  Yeah yeah, sure, I'm interested.
303050030         //  Alright, here you go. Fork over the dough.
303050040         //  Sure, sure. Here's your money.
303050041         //  Thanks, pal. Now forget you saw me.
303050050         //  Hey uh, interested in buying some gas stamps?
303050060         //  Sure. Just keep this between you and me, alright?
303050070         //  No problem. Just make sure you do the same...
303050080         //  Sure. Sounds good to me...
303050090         //  Hey uh, you in the market for some surplus gas stamps?
303050100         //  Sure. Where'd you get 'em? On second thought I don't even want to know.
303050110         //  Smart man. Alright now fork over the dough.
303050120         //  Yeah, alright. Just hope I don't get into trouble for this.
303050121         //  Don't worry about it. Just keep your mouth shut.
303050130         //  Listen, I got these extra gas stamps. You want 'em, they're yours. Cheap...
303050140         //  Yeah, alright. I'm good with that.
303050150         //  Alright, here you go. And keep your mouth shut about this, alright?
303050160         //  Sure thing buddy. It'll be our secret.
303050161         //  It better be...
303050200         //  Shit. It's after midnight. OK, well I guess that's a bust. I should go back to Joe's.
303050210         //  Alright, that's the last of them. At least I got some cash. I should head back to Joe's.
303140980         //  Joe's Pleasure Palace, Vito speaking...
303140990         //  Vito, why didn't you come home last night? I was worried sick.
303141000         //  Mamma?  I didn't know you had Joe's number, and whose phone is this?
303141010         //  So have you spoken to Mister Papalardo, find yourself a job?
303141040         //  Yeah, he told me to come by and see him today.  Hopefully he's got some work for me.
303141050         //  OK, Vito. Good luck, mio Bambino.
303141060         //  Alright. Bye, Mamma.
303141090         //  That reminds me, I promised Mamma I'd go see that Papalardo guy.  I should head down to the port.
303141130         //  If you're selling that thing, just park it in the garage. Then come get your money.
303141200         //  If you're hungry there's some food in the 'fridgerator.
303141210         //  You hungry, Vito?  Take whatever you want from the fridge.
303990001         //  Joe made the war go away, and next up was making sure my family was alright. I spent a week doing odd jobs for chump change, but it wasn't enough. That's where Joe came in... (phone rings)
304010001         //  I should pick that up. Might be important...
304010010         //  Dammit, forgot my gun!
304010020         //  Ahh shit, forgot the lockpicks.
304010030         //  OK, let's get going.
304010040         //  Hey, so how'd it go at the port?
304010050         //  What, you mean with Derek?
304010060         //  Yeah, he's a piece of work, ain't he?! He give you a job?
304010070         //  Yeah, I worked some guys over, but it was small-time crap. He shakes down these hard-up dockworkers just like he did my old man.
304010080         //  Well, you didn't have to do it, it's not like he forced you to work for him, is it?
304010090         //  My mother almost did...
304010100         //  Quit whining and keep in touch with Derek. Trust me, he's got better jobs than shaking down wharf rats.
304010110         //  Hey, fucknuts, what's the hold up?
304010120         //  Use the back entrance!
304010130         //  Can't go that way!
304020100         //  Alright, this here's the box. Open it and disconnect the alarm.
304020110         //  Hey fucknuts, what's the hold up?
304020111         //  C'mon, Vito. Hurry it up. We ain't got all night.
304020112         //  Move it, Vito! We can't sit out here forever!
304020120         //  OK, now cut the power.
304020130         //  Dammit, Joe, there's too many fucking wires. "Simple" my ass.
304020490         //  Holy shit, it actually worked! The light went off!
304020500         //  Yeah, must've been even simpler than I thought.
304020510         //  Dick. Come on, let's go.
304022081         //  C'mon, let's go pick up our uniforms.
304030030         //  No time for that. We got a job to do!
304030130         //  Vito. Open this door.
304040010         //  What the hell are you waiting for?! Get 'em, lads!
304040020         //  Brian! What about the cops?
304040030         //  Screw the cops! Get the goddamned jewelry!
304040040         //  Freeze! Police! There's no way out!
304040050         //  Fuck!
304040051         //  We gotta get the fuck out of here!
304040060         //  Shit! There's gotta be another way out.
304040061         //  Come on, let's get outta here!
304040062         //  I'm trying!
304040063         //  Vito, what the hell are you waiting for?
304040064         //  Come on, Vito! We gotta go!
304040065         //  Come on, Vito! Move your ass!
304040066         //  Shit, cops!
304040067         //  Shit! We gotta find another way!
304040068         //  Watch my ass while I open this door!
304040069         //  Alright, hurry it up, I'll cover you.
304040070         //  We gotta get to the roof. Watch my back, I'll try to open the door!
304040071         //  Joe, come on! What's taking so long?
304040072         //  Got it! Alright, come on!
304040073         //  Hey, Vito, I got it open! Come on!
304040074         //  This way! This should take us to the street!
304040075         //  Shit, they're still coming after us.
304040076         //  No shit! That's why we gotta move, genius. Come on!
304040077         //  Come on!
304040078         //  They're trying to break the door down.
304040079         //  What the fuck did you expect? That's why we gotta move!
304040080         //  Here! Take my gun and keep shooting!
304040081         //  Keep those assholes off my back!
304040082         //  Almost got it! Hold 'em off just a little longer!
304040083         //  Come on, you piece of shit, open up!
304040084         //  Just a few more seconds Vito!
304040090         //  OK. Got it! We're out of here, Vito! Come on!
304040099         //  What are you waiting for? Christmas?
304040100         //  Shit!
304040110         //  Go back! We gotta find another way out.
304040120         //  Can't go that way, it's crawling with cops!
304040130         //  Shit, this one's locked too. Watch the stairs and I'll open it up!
304040140         //  Shit, another dead end!
304040150         //  Vito, grab one of them rods and jam it in the door! That'll keep 'em busy for a while!
304040151         //  Come on! We gotta block off this fucking door!
304040152         //  Quit fucking around and give me a hand here!
304040153         //  You picked a great time to turn into a retard, you know that?
304040160         //  We gotta go this way. It's our only shot!
304040170         //  What are you fucking crazy? It's covered in ice. One slip and we're dead!
304040180         //  We got no choice. I ain't going to the joint!
304040190         //  Sarge, door's jammed!
304040200         //  So kick it in, damn it!
304040210         //  Shit!
304040310         //  Henry's never gonna believe this... Stupid bastards. Let's go.
304040990         //  Go, go, I'll cover you!
304040991         //  Vito, c'mon! Cover us!
304990001         //  I promised myself when I shipped out, I was never gonna be poor again. I made more money pulling that OPA job than I did in my whole life, but I still needed more if I was gonna pay off my father's debt.   (Vito picks up note)
305010110         //  n_Yeah, what do you want?
305010120         //  n_Uhm...Henry Tomasino sent me to pick up the stuff he ordered.
305010130         //  n_Alright, come on in.
305010200         //  Gotta pick up the machine gun first.
305040021         //  What, you forget something? Hey, whatever you need, chances are I got it.
305040022         //  A machine gun ain't enough? Hahaha! What else you need?
305040023         //  How about a backup gun? Like my mother always said, you can never have too much firepower. Hahahaha.
305040024         //  You need something else, Vito?
305040025         //  The gun's in the crate, and there's a couple thousand rounds in the van out in the yard. Take it, it's all paid for.
305040026         //  I should take the van.
305040027         //  I'm not carrying this thing across the city.
305050010         //  That's him, Vito! Waste that fat fuck!
305050011         //  Oh shit!
305050012         //  What the hell kind of gun is that!?
305050013         //  Somebody get in there!
305050014         //  We gotta get up there and take 'em out!
305050020         //  Aw shit, he got away! We gotta get him or we're in deep shit. Waste the goons! Then we go after tubby!
305050021         //  Watch my back, I'm going in!
305050022         //  Come on, fellas, we gotta get 'em!
305050024         //  Vito, come on, ha?  We gotta move.
305050030         //  Can't run out on Joe.
305050031         //  Gotta go back and finish the job.
305050032         //  Too late to call it quits now, we gotta finish this.
305050040         //  Great! Now they shot up the getaway car!
305050050         //  They're on the second floor!
305050060         //  Careful, they got a fucking machine gun!
305050070         //  Here it is!
305050080         //  Up the stairs!
305050090         //  This door!

305050092         //  Alright, alright, I'm coming.
305050093         //  C'mon, let's move, or that fat fuck's gonna get away!
305050094         //  We got 'em all! Stop shooting that fucking thing I'm going deaf over here!

305050096         //  Come on, get out here, Vito!

305050100         //  Here they come!
305050110         //  Take the boss upstairs! We'll take care of 'em.
305050120         //  n_ Ah! Help! Oh fuck! I'm on fire! Holy shit!  Help me, fuck me! Help me please!
305050130         //  Move it, Vito! We can't let that fat bastard get away!
305050140         //  Go! Go! We'll cover you!
305050150         //  Anybody else get the feeling things are getting a little out of hand here?
305050160         //  OK, you first, Vito! You're the fucking war hero.
305050170         //  Let me out of here! Open the fucking door!
305050171         //  Let me out! Hey! Come on, help! Help! Let me out!
305050180         //  Don't come no closer! Leave me alone!
305050190         //  Stop! Stay where you are!
305050200         //  Help! Don't hurt me!
305050201         //  Burn, assholes!
305050202         //  Oh fuck, watch out!
305050203         //  Oh shit, watch it!
305050204         //  What the fuck was that?!
305050205         //  Looks like nobody told that idiot that alcohol's flammable! He set the stills on fire and they blew.
305050206         //  Goddamnit! Now this whole fucking place is gonna burn to the ground! What a waste of booze!
305050207         //  Shit, too hot!
305050208         //  Whoa! It's flaming up good!
305050209         //  Gotta hurry, the fire's spreading!
305050210         //  Shit, the fire's everywhere!
305050211         //  Fuck! I think I singed my eyebrows!
305050212         //  Let's go! Let's go! Around the fire!
305050213         //  Let's go! We gotta hurry! Pretty soon every cop in the city's gonna be here!
305050215         //  I should wait for Joe and Henry.
305050216         //  OK, hit the button, Vito.
305050217         //  What, are you deaf?
305050218         //  Come on! We're taking the elevator!
305050219         //  Hey, Vito, get in here!
305050220         //  What the hell are you doing, Joe?
305050221         //  Damn smoke...
305050222         //  
305050223         //  Shit...
305050224         //  Oh shit! That was close!
305050225         //  Oh, fuck! Oh!
305050226         //  This whole fucking place is coming apart!
305050230         //  What? I'm thirsty. Pretty good stuff - you should try it.
305050231         //  Pretty good stuff. You should try it.
305050240         //  Drinking on the job, huh? When'd you turn Irish?
305050250         //  We're coming for you, Porky!
305050251         //  We'll cover you, Vito!
305050252         //  Kick the fucking door in!
305050253         //  Come on! Porky's upstairs!
305050254         //  Hey, Vito, c'mon, huh?! We can't wait forever!
305050260         //  Shit! There's an army of 'em!
305050270         //  Fuck this! That was too fucking close.
305050280         //  Vito, do something! You're the expert here.
305050281         //  I ain't planning on dying in this fucking dump.
305050290         //  What the fuck do you expect me to do, they're shooting at me for Chrissakes.
305050300         //  Shit, they got Tommys!
305050310         //  Vito, see if you can go around the side! We'll try and draw their fire!
305050320         //  Vito, Joe, do something! We can't just fucking sit here!
305050800         //  Die, you rat bastard!
305050810         //  Come on, let's kill these fucks and go get tubby!
305050820         //  Is that the best you got asshole!?
305050830         //  You missed, you blind prick!
305050840         //  Vito, come on, I thought you was supposed to be good at this!
305050850         //  Hey Vito, you alright?
305050860         //  Hey, don't worry, it's just a scratch!
305050870         //  Alright, just watch yourself!
305060010         //  Shit, that's all we need!
305060011         //  Ah shit, the cops! C'mon, Vito. Let's get the fuck out of here!
305060020         //  Careful!
305060030         //  Keep that shit up and Henry's a dead man!
305060040         //  Jesus, are you fucking nuts?
305060050         //  You're gonna kill us all, you crazy fuck!
305060060         //  Lose the fucking cops.
305060061         //  Shit, get the cops off our ass!
305060070         //  Stop, here it is!
305060071         //  Jesus, you drive like my fucking grandmother.
305060072         //  Hey, Vito, step on it! Henry's sweatin' like a whore in church back here!
305060073         //  Vito, head to El Greco's! We don't got much time!
305060074         //  Hey, step on it or Henry's done for. If he dies, you're burying him.
305060075         //  Aw come on, Vito! At this rate we'd get there faster if we walked!
305060076         //  You know what would make me drive faster? You, statti zitto!
305060080         //  Oh...
305060081         //  Oh... Oh! You did that on fucking purpose, you fuck!
305060090         //  Ugh! Vito!
305060100         //  Argh....
305060110         //  Ugh!
305060111         //  If I don't make it...
305060112         //  Hey, hey, don't go saying that, pal. It's just a scratch. The doc will give you a few stitches and then we'll all go out and celebrate.
305060113         //  No, really...
305060114         //  Shhh... you shouldn't talk right now. Helps conserve your strength. I saw that in a movie once.
305060115         //  Yeah? And what happened to the guy in the movie?
305060116         //  He died.
305060117         //  Argh...
305060118         //  Hey, Henry, you awake? Stay with me now.
305060119         //  Yeah...
305060120         //  OK, here we are. Hang in there.
305060121         //  Just hang in there, pal, we'll be at El Greco's in a minute. I can smell the souvlaki from here.
305060122         //  Vito, can't you go no faster?! Henry ain't got much more blood left to bleed.
305060123         //  I'm going as fast as I can, dammit...
305060124         //  Vito, there, that house! Park right in front.
305060125         //  Hey, Marco Polo, where the hell you going? It's back that way! Go back!
305060126         //  What the fuck are you doing? Get back in the car! Henry's bleeding to death over here!
305060127         //  Vito! C'mon, I'm dying here.
305060128         //  What the fuck, Vito? Get the hell back here!
305060129         //  Henry, hey, wake up. Henry, you hear me!? Ahh shit! Vito, come on! Hurry it up!
305060130         //  Oh, shit, this hurts...
305060131         //  Vito, go ring the bell. I'll get Henry out of the car.
305060132         //  OK.
305060133         //  I'm doing the best I can here, alright?!
305060134         //  Ugh... Thanks for trying, fellas... ugh...
305060135         //  No! Henry, Henry! Ahhh shit, he's dead!
305060136         //  We can't go to the hospital, Vito. They call the cops if you come in with a bullet in ya. Get us to El Greco's!
305060230         //  Guess they're not home. I'll stop by later.
305060250         //  No can do. I need this money to pay off my old man's debt.
305060260         //  Can't do that now, I gotta give this money over to Mama and Francesca first.
305060270         //  This isn't a good time.
305060300         //  Vito!  Come on, can't this thing go any faster?!
305060310         //  I'm going as fast as I can, dammit!
305060320         //  Well, it ain't fast enough!
305060330         //  Just relax, would ya!
305060340         //  I got a hole in my leg the size of a fuckin' golf ball, and you're telling me to relax!? Just get me to El Greco, dammit!
305060350         //  Hey. Henry. I'm not the reason you got shot. Don't take it out on me, alright?!
305060570         //  So fellas, who is this guy?
305060580         //  What guy?
305060590         //  This guy we're taking Henry to.
305060600         //  El Greco? He's a doctor. Throw him a couple of bucks, he patches you up - no questions asked.
305060610         //  He's the guy you go see when you can't go to the hospital, genius.
305060620         //  Why the hell wouldn't you be able to go to the hospital?
305060630         //  Because you go to the hospital with a bullet in you, first thing they do is call the cops.
305060640         //  Yeah... So El Greco deals with a lot of guys in our line of work.
305060650         //  You shouldn't need to visit him, though, Vito. You always been a quick healer. Must be your diet.
305500010         //  You dumb broad! You almost killed me!
305500020         //  But I...
305500030         //  Hey, isn't that Joe's girl over there? Well, one of 'em anyway...
305500040         //  If you can't drive, you should stay home where you belong!
305500050         //  Look at my fucking car!
305500060         //  Hey, you're gonna pay me for that!
305500080         //  Leave me alone!
305500090         //  You're not going anywhere 'til you pay me for this!
305500100         //  Help me! Somebody! He's crazy!
305500110         //  Oh, I'll show you crazy, you bitch!
305500120         //  You smacked up my car, I'm gonna smack up yours!
305500130         //  Argh! How do you like that, huh?! Argh!
305500140         //  Stupid broad! Get the hell back here!
305500150         //  Hey, stop!

305500170         //  Fuck you!
305500180         //  Hey, pal. Knock it off.
305500190         //  And who the fuck are you?
305500200         //  Somebody who doesn't like hearing you talk to a lady like that. So why don't you shut the fuck up, and leave while I'm still in a good mood, huh?
305500210         //  What is she, your girlfriend or something? Well, if she's not gonna pay for it, you will!
305500250         //  Ugh!... You asshole.
305500260         //  One more word, and you're gonna need a new set of teeth. Now, get the fuck out of here!
305500270         //  I...
305500280         //  That was the word...
305500290         //  Thanks, handsome. I owe you one. Do you wanna come over to my place for a... piece of pie?
305500300         //  Yeah, thanks, but, uh look, I, I really gotta get going.
305500310         //  Mmmmm, you'll like it, I promise. I gotta get going now. I'll see you around!
305500320         //  Ahhhh... Alright, I better head over to Freddy's.
305600120         //  Oh god. Oh god no!
305600130         //  Oh no, no!
305600140         //  No, please! I don't want to die.
305610400         //  Come on, let's waste these fucks!
305990001         //  Saw a lot of Henry the week after the job at the mall. He was real friendly. Thing is, in this business, only time a guy's friendly is when he wants something. (prostitute starts talking)

305990020         //  Hey, we're all set. Meet us over at the apartment.
305990030         //  Yeah, right. I'm leaving now. You got the package?
305990040         //  What do you think? Henry's setting it up now. Get your ass moving, that fat fuck'll show up any minute.
305990050         //  All right. I'll see you in a bit.
306010010         //  OK, let's go!

306040256         //  n_Go man, go! You gots it!

306040271         //  n_You ain't got what it takes, brother! Just give up now, my man!
306040274         //  n_Those arms burning, ain't they! No shame in throwing in the towel!
306040277         //  n_You ain't never gonna beat my shit.  Why you even trying?
306040280         //  n_Yo, I gots two loosies say this motherfucker don't even get close to my man's record.
306040283         //  n_Look at this scrawny motherfucker! Ain't no way he gonna do it!
306040286         //  n_Throw in the towel!  Throw in the goddamn towel, man!
306040289         //  Get lost, jack. This shit's private.
306040290         //  Sorry man. The Negro-lympics ain't open to no crackers.
306040291         //  Alright then, fuck you very much.
306040292         //  Alright, I guess these guys are busy.
306040293         //  Uh, they don't seem too friendly.
306040294         //  n_ The war... war is just beginning. All your base... ALL you base... Are belong to us.  To US!  Someone... set us up... yes, they set us up the BOMB!  You are on the path of destruction... with no chance to survive... Make your time... all of you, make your time... no chance... no chance to survive. All your base...
306040295         //  Uhhhhaaghhh!
306040300         //  n_One-thousand, eight-hundred and seventy-fucking-six.
306040310         //  n_What?
306040320         //  n_1876 days. I have to survive 1876 more days in this shit hole until I get out.
306040330         //  n_You're counting it in days? How much is it in years? Two?
306040340         //  n_Well, there's three-hundred sixty-five days in a year. So if it were just two years, that would only be uh, seven-hundred thirty days.
306040350         //  n_So how many years then? I ain't too good with arithmatic.
306040360         //  n_Argh... Five years and almost two months. How long for you?
306040370         //  n_They should let me out next summer.
306040380         //  n_Lucky bastard.
306040430         //  n_Hey, Minh.
306040440         //  n_Hello, Willis.
306040450         //  n_I was wondering... You think you could teach me some of that, that shit you guys do.
306040460         //  n_What you talking about, Willis?
306040470         //  n_You know, that ching chong karate shit.
306040480         //  n_Sorry... Minh cannot train soul brother in ways of kung-fu.
306040490         //  n_Why not?
306040500         //  n_It is forbidden... but...
306040510         //  n_But what?
306040520         //  n_Minh make you deal. You teach Minh basketball, Minh teach you kung-fu.
306040530         //  n_Alright! You got a deal, motherfucker!
306040540         //  n_You seen Gabe lately?
306040550         //  n_Uh uh... He's in the hole.
306040560         //  n_Again?
306040570         //  n_Yep.
306040580         //  n_What'd he do this time?
306040590         //  n_The usual. Told Stone to go and fuck himself and then tried to fight the guards.
306040600         //  n_The guy's got balls alright.
306040610         //  n_And a couple sandwiches short of a picnic, though...
306040620         //  n_You hear about Dan? Heard they got him in the showers.
306040630         //  n_Yeah, those fucking queers are getting out of hand, huh?
306040640         //  n_Damn straight.
306040650         //  n_And this time, he ended up in the infirmary.
306040660         //  n_What'd they rip his rear end open or something? Hehehe...
306040670         //  n_No, they broke his fucking skull.
306040680         //  n_Shit.
306040690         //  Hey, Jimmy. Uh, is it true about you being in uh... You know... in the club?
306040700         //  Got no idea what you're talking about.
306040710         //  You know the "club", where you fight.
306040720         //  Like I said - never heard of it.
306040740         //  That's what everybody says. That's the first rule, right?
306040750         //  What's the first rule?
306040760         //  That you don't talk about it.
306040770         //  I wouldn't know.
306040780         //  Hey, you know that old guy?
306040790         //  I know a lot of old guys. You're gonna have to be more specific.
306040800         //  The old mobster with all the muscle.
306040810         //  You mean old man Galante?
306040820         //  Yeah, that's him.
306040830         //  What about him?
306040840         //  I heard he used to be a prizefighter way back when.
306040850         //  Yeah? Well, must've been a hell of a long time ago. I mean, who'd he fight? Some friggin' dinosaurs?
306040860         //  Haha. That's a good one. But I wouldn't go saying that too loud, though...
306040870         //  Yeah, no shit.
306050001         //  n_Come on, you overgrown retard.
306050002         //  n_This is gonna be easier than the time I shoved a potato up your mother's ass.
306050003         //  n_You eat faggots for breakfast?
306050004         //  n_I'm gonna break you, dago.
306050005         //  n_You and your boyfriend Barbaro are dead.
306050006         //  n_I eat skinny little faggots like you for breakfast.
306050010         //  n_Kill him, O'Neill!!!
306050020         //  n_Kick his ass, O'Neill! Stomp his fucking brain!
306050030         //  n_Yeah, kick his fucking dago ass!
306050040         //  n_Fight, fight!
306050050         //  n_Get him!
306050060         //  n_Kick his teeth in!
306050070         //  n_Yeah, kill him!
306050071         //  n_Tear him a new one, O'Neill!
306050072         //  n_Is that all you've got?
306050073         //  n_Raaaah! Nothing!
306050074         //  n_He fights like a wee little girl!
306050075         //  n_What do you say I put this sorry little bitch out of her misery!
306050076         //  Fight in the yard! Fight in the yard! All available officers, please report to the yard.
306050077         //  All inmates are to return to their cells immediately. Failure to comply will result in the loss of yard privileges for one month.
306050090         //  Step back! Did you hear me? Get out of here! Step the fuck back!
306050091         //  Get the fuck back!
306050100         //  OK, that's enough! Break it up! Both of you are going to the hole!
306050110         //  We're gonna give you a little time to think about what you've done.
306050120         //  Close it up!
306050130         //  Ah, great...
306050135         //  So, O'Neill almost took my head off, but... I made a stand. Let me tell you something - when you're inside, that counts for a lot more than you might think.
306050140         //  How long, sir?
306050150         //  A week should be enough. No less.
306050160         //  Yes, sir.
306050170         //  Just when I was telling myself it couldn't get any worse...
306050240         //  OK, today we're gonna work on your counter-punching.
306050250         //  Vito, I want you to hit Pepé. Try and bust that big jaw of his.
306050260         //  Pepé, you avoid the punch like I showed you, then use that momentum to throw a punch of your own.
306050270         //  Alright fellas, let's get going.
306050280         //  n_What are you tired already kid?  Come on, let's see you throw some punches.
306050290         //  n_You forget how to fight kid? Let's go, start throwing them haymakers.
306050300         //  n_Quit screwing around! Start throwing punches, Vito!
306050310         //  n_Keep that oversized chin of yours down, goddamnit!
306050320         //  n_Footwork Pepé, remember your footwork.
306050330         //  n_Remember - good defense can win a fight, fellas!  Every punch you take could be your last.
306050340         //  n_Nice, real nice!
306050350         //  n_Alright, now do it again.
306050360         //  n_Atta boy, Pepé.
306050370         //  n_There you go. That's the ticket.
306050380         //  n_Come on, get up. I had dames smack me harder than that.
306050390         //  n_Quit layin' down on the job. Back on your feet, kid.
306050400         //  n_Ah for crying out loud... Remind me to teach you how to take a punch!
306050410         //  n_If you were half as good as I was in my day, that wouldn't have happened.
306050420         //  Whoa! Would you look at that!
306050430         //  Hey! We supposed to be sparring or training?
306050440         //  Change of plans, big fella. This kid's got fire in him. So now you both are gonna practice your counter-punches.
306050450         //  Alright, Vito, see if you can do that again. It's a handy tool to have in the box, huh? Most guys ain't gonna see it coming. Pepé here, hehe... He ain't most guys, though...
306050460         //  n_Nice kid, nice. Gimme two more of those.
306050470         //  n_Alright, one more Vito.
306050480         //  n_There ya go. You're a fast learner, kid.
306050490         //  Alright fellas, that's enough for today.  Nice work.
306070030         //  Alright, kid, you can stick around if ya want, get to know the fellas. But come see me before you go, I got something in mind for ya.
306070040         //  If you're beat though, you can just call it quits for today. I'll catch up with ya tomorrow. It's up to you.
306070050         //  Hey, how's it going?
306070060         //  How you doing, Vito? Name's Sal.  Hey, nice work in the ring.
306070070         //  Yeah thanks, uh... Hey, speaking of which, you wanna do some sparring?
306070080         //  Ugh... Not for nothing but I got better shit to do than get my head busted. Ask Al, he needs his ass kicked.
306070090         //  Yeah, alright, thanks.
306070100         //  So uh, what brought you here, Sal?
306070110         //  I felt like lifting weights, and this is where the weights are.
306070120         //  No no, I mean, uh... How'd you land in the big house?
306070130         //  I killed a guy for asking too many questions.
306070140         //  Alright then, I'll see you later.
306070150         //  Agh... Listen, no disrespect, but I gotta finish my workout, alright?
306070160         //  No problem.
306070170         //  Try me later.
306070180         //  Hey, not right now, Vito.
306070190         //  Hey, can't you take a hint?
306070200         //  Hey, how you doing? Name's Vito.
306070210         //  Yeah, I know.  Name's Al.  Good to meet ya.
306070220         //  Hey uh, you feel like sparring?
306070230         //  Yeah, sure, why not?
306070240         //  Up for a few more rounds?
306070250         //  Always, kid.
306070260         //  Alright, let's go.
306070270         //  OK, but go easy on me, OK? I ain't a pro like you or Pepé.
306070280         //  Yeah, you know what? Maybe later.
306070290         //  Sure. I'll be here.
306070300         //  Alright, let's do this.
306070310         //  You wanna keep goin'?
306070320         //  Hey, you know what? That's it for now.
306070330         //  Alright, your choice.
306070340         //  How's it goin'? I'm Vito.
306070350         //  Chris.  How can I help you?
306070360         //  I'm looking to go a few rounds. You interested?
306070370         //  Buddy, I'm busy. Try Al over there.
306070380         //  I told ya, I'm busy.
306070390         //  Hey, fuck off, buddy, if you didn't get the hint.
306070400         //  Hey. How you doing? Name's Vito.
306070410         //  Sam. How ya doing?
306070420         //  Hey, you wanna spar?
306070430         //  Not really. Sorry.
306070440         //  Sorry, I'm kinda busy here, alright?
306070450         //  Not now, OK?
306070460         //  Beat it, will ya?
306070470         //  Vito, we're done for today, alright? I gotta rest up, huh?
306070480         //  If you need something, go see Mr.  Galante.
306070490         //  Hey Vito, you talk to Mr. Galante if you need something.
306070500         //  So... Feel like testing yourself in a real fight?
306070510         //  I guess it depends on who I'm fighting.
306070520         //  Well the chinks wanna put their champ up against one of our guys.  If you're up to it, I'll give ya a little piece of the action.
306070530         //  And remember - the more you fight, the more the guys get to know who you are.  A good fighter can really make a name for himself around here.
306070540         //  I'm sorry Mr. Galante, but I'm beat after that match with Pepé.
306070550         //  Alright then, go get some rest, Nancy.  I'll see ya tomorrow.
306070560         //  Sure, why not.
306070570         //  That's what I like to hear.  Alright kid, come with me.
306070580         //  You change your mind?
306070590         //  Sorry, I'm runnin' on fumes here, Mr. Galante.
306070600         //  Alright, suit yourself...
306070610         //  Yeah, sign me up.
306070620         //  Haha, I knew you weren't a sissy.  Alright kid, come with me.
306070700         //  n_Nice one!
306070710         //  n_Shit! That had to hurt!
306070720         //  n_Whoa!
306070730         //  n_Ouch!
306070740         //  n_Bang... hahaha...
306070750         //  n_Kid's good!
306070760         //  n_Yeah! I never seen Pepé go down like that.
306070770         //  n_Dodge and punch. Dodge and punch.
306070780         //  n_You deaf? Dodge then punch. It's ain't that hard.
306070790         //  n_ Come on. Give me another twenty.
306070800         //  n_Yeah, that's it.
306070810         //  n_Keep it up.
306070820         //  Hell of a job with that asshole O'Neill. Nice. Next time do us all a favor and snap the prick's neck, would ya?
306070830         //  n_How's Old Man Galante know so much about boxing?
306070840         //  n_Never know by looking at him now, but he was a prizefighter back in the day. Damn good one too.
306070850         //  n_No shit.
306070860         //  n_Yeah, I heard he used to fight in bare knuckle matches before he went pro.
306070870         //  n_I'm just glad he organizes these fights. Not that there's anything else to do in here, you know? And he must be making a small fortune on all the bets he takes.
306070880         //  n_Haha. Matter of fact, I heard that's what he's in here for - he was one of the biggest bookies in Empire Bay.
306070890         //  Winston's offering two-to-one against Pepé. Pepé wasn't a friend of mine, I'd take that bet. O'Neill's a fucking animal.
306070900         //  Nice work in the ring, buddy. Little more of that, and you'll be ready for a real fight.
306080010         //  Now listen - these chinks are quick little bastards. No point in throwing big punches early on, you'll never connect.
306080020         //  Alright, what am I supposed to do then?
306080030         //  You hit him quick and tire him out.  When he's weak he'll put his guard down, then you swing for the fences.
306080040         //  Now get out there and show 'em what you're made of.
306080050         //  n_You gotta be faster than that, kid!
306080060         //  n_Wear him out before you use the big guns, kid!
306080070         //  n_Now's the time kid! Let him have it!
306080080         //  n_There you go, Vito! Now unload on him!
306080090         //  n_Beat him out of recognizable shape!
306080100         //  n_Ah! I need to learn that style...
306080110         //  n_Haha! Beware! Your bone going to be disconnected.
306080120         //  n_Haha! His round eyes can see, but he does not look.
306080130         //  n_Hey, hit him good, just like this! Hit faster! Hit him like that, there you go! Good, good, good!
306080140         //  n_Hey, hit him good, just like this! Hit faster! Hit him like that, there you go!
306080150         //  n_Fuck him up! Fuck him up!
306080160         //  n_Oh, what are you doing?! Lose to gwai-lo dishonorable!

306080190         //  n_His master will not be happy...
306080200         //  n_Beat him to death! Hurry up and beat him to death! Just like that, kick him! Hurry up and kick him! Just like that - Hit him, hit him!
306080210         //  n_Beat him to death! Hurry up and beat him to death! Just like that, kick him! Hurry up and kick him! Just like that - Hit him, hit him!
306080220         //  n_Hit him! Hit him! Hit him now!
306080230         //  Hey, does Vito get a fortune cookie after eating your guy for breakfast? Haha!
306080240         //  We'll see how tough you are when you fight like a man... None of that ching chong shit!
306080250         //  Oh yeah? I got an order of mu-shu go-fuck-yourself right here!
306080260         //  Ha! You big but you no tough!

306080280         //  Your man go down this time, gwai-lo!
306080290         //  With old Leo watching my back, my chances of making it out alive suddenly seemed a hell of a lot better...
306080300         //  But like everything else in my life.... It came with a price...
306080310         //  Let's go Scaletta. You're late for work.
306080320         //  Hey listen, Vito here's got the day off, courtesy of Mr. Galante.
306080330         //  Gotcha. Don't get used to it, Scaletta.
306080340         //  Alright, come with me, Vito.
306080350         //  What, are we gonna train some more?
306080360         //  Sort of. You'll see.
306080370         //  Morning, kid.
306080380         //  Morning, Mr. Galante. What, no training today?
306080390         //  Not exactly...  We got a challenge from the spooks, and I don't want to risk Pepé getting all banged up before his big fight with O'Neill.
306080400         //  So I want you to take this one. It'll be good practice for you.
306080410         //  Come on.
306080420         //  Now the guy you're gonna be fighting is a strong bastard, but he ain't too bright.  Fights with his heart, not his head.
306080430         //  You piss him off, he'll lower his guard...  That's when you let him have it.
306080440         //  Oooh, looky here. I'm a take this skinny-ass white boy to school.
306080450         //  Gonna hit him so hard his mama's mama gonna feel it.
306080460         //  Alright, here we go. Make me proud, kid.
306080470         //  n_Now Vito! Grab him and finish him off!
306080480         //  n_Alright kid, now put his lights out!
306080490         //  n_Now's your chance, kid! Knock him into next week!
306080500         //  n_Timing, kid! Timing's everything!
306080510         //  n_Dammit, you almost had him!
306080520         //  n_Yo, what the fuck was that?
306080530         //  n_Man, that's some bullshit right there!
306080540         //  n_What the fuck just happened, yo?
306080550         //  n_Man, who taught this brother how to fight...

306080640         //  Hell of a job kid, hell of a job.
306080650         //  Here's your cut, Vito.  You earned it.
306080660         //  n_You see that shit! I think I'm gonna kill this fool!
306080670         //  n_How'd that feel?! I got some more of that for ya.
306080680         //  n_Whowee! White bread gonna need some new teeth after this.
306080690         //  n_Oooh! You gone and messed up a perfectly good white boy.
306080700         //  n_You the man, my brother!
306080710         //  n_Look at that wobbly kneed muthafucka!
306080720         //  n_Goddamn look at that... I just pity the fool!
306080730         //  n_Yeah! That's the way you do it, my brother!
306080740         //  n_Shit. I think he gonna kill the cracker.
306080750         //  n_Get it together in there, Vito!
306080760         //  n_Don't worry Vito, you got him right where you want him!
306080770         //  n_C'mon Vito, what the hell was that?!
306080780         //  n_Let's go Vito, put these bums back in their place!
306080790         //  n_Jesus, he's getting creamed in there, huh?
306080800         //  n_Ah, jeez - a couple more like that we're gonna have to throw in the towel.
306080810         //  n_Come on Vito, you gotta do better than that!
306080820         //  n_Lucky shot. Come on, Vito! Take him down.
306080830         //  n_Your little cracker going down!
306080840         //  n_Know what, I don't just feel bad for this wop, I pity the fool!
306080850         //  n_Hope you meatballs getting ready to lose!
306080860         //  n_Oh, this boy got as much chance of winning as a brother running for president.
306080870         //  n_This little Rocky Marciano asshole gonna get hisself hurt.
306080880         //  n_Gonna be hard to land punches on that greasy motherfucker. Hahaaa!
306080890         //  n_Hey - win or lose, it'll probably be the hardest work this bum ever did in his life.
306080900         //  n_Nice of you boys to show up. What? We schedule this one on colored people's time?
306080910         //  n_Hope your guy fights as good as the rest of you's talk shit.
306080920         //  n_You talk tough now right, just wait 'til your guy's on the fucking floor.
306080930         //  n_All bark and no bite, just like last time, right fellas?
306080940         //  n_Hey, how many slices of watermelon it gonna take to get you to shut the fuck up?
306080950         //  Yo, one of the hacks is coming!
306080960         //  What the hell is this, some kind of circle jerk?
306080970         //  Alright, come on Scaletta. You got a visitor.
306080980         //  Hey, what's the hold up, Scaletta?
306080990         //  You wanna see your visitor, or you want a beating?
306081000         //  Get the hell over here, Scaletta, now!
306090010         //  Let's go Scaletta. Those toilets ain't gonna clean themselves.
306090020         //  Let's go Scaletta. You got work to do.
306090030         //  You looking to catch a beating? Let's go!
306090040         //  Come on, stop half-assing it.
306090050         //  You're slower than molasses in February, you know that?
306090060         //  Let's go already, pick up the pace!
306090070         //  I don't wanna hear any more of your mouth. If you don't like it, you can always go back to cleaning toilets.
306090080         //  So you're the new cleaning lady, huh? Follow me.
306090090         //  There you go. Make 'em sparkle, and hurry it up.
306090100         //  What's the matter? Keep cleaning or else...
306090110         //  Hey, looks like this one's still dirty. Clean it again.
306090120         //  You deaf? Clean that pisser, now!
306090130         //  You deaf? Clean that shitter, NOW!
306090140         //  You feel like spending some more time in the hole? Then get to cleaning!
306090150         //  That's more like it.  Clean it good.
306090160         //  Alright, that's enough. Now you're gonna go join the rest of the animals in the showers. Get moving.
306090170         //  Hey. Hey! I am in need of urgent medical attention. Somebody come and take my ass to the infirmary pronto.
306090180         //  Man, you need to shut the fuck up. Ain't nothing wrong with your pasty ass. But I'll tell you what - if you keep hollering like that, there's gonna be.
306090190         //  Hey, looky here. It's that new guy. That was one hell of a fight man! Thanks for the entertainment. Ya'll should sell tickets next time.
306090200         //  n_ singing
306090210         //  Hey pal, you mind?
306090220         //  Yo, practice that shit someplace else.
306090230         //  C'mon man, you're killing us.
306090240         //  Jesus... Your singing is the second worst thing that happened to me in here.
306090250         //  Hey, pipe down NOW, ALL OF YA'S!
306090260         //  Relax, fellas. I'm just giving the old pipes a workout.
306090270         //  Any more of that shit and I'm a give yo face a workout, you dig?
306090280         //  Alright, alright. Jeez, you guys got no culture.
306090290         //  Alright Scaletta, get your clothes off and get cleaned up, would you kindly?
306090380         //  n_Heheheh... It's party time... Let's dance, sweetheart...
306090390         //  Wha - hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, what the hell's going on! And where's Frank?
306090400         //  Morning, sunshine! You're just making friends all over, aren't you?
306090410         //  Oh... shit!
306090420         //  Piss me off and I'll let 'em visit you. I'm sure they'd just love to spend some time with you in private!
306090430         //  Hahahahaha...
306090500         //  n_Do that again sweet cheeks. It's turning me on.
306090510         //  n_This could've been so much easier.
306090530         //  n_Hurry it up, John, we ain't got long!
306090540         //  n_C'mon, take him down.
306090550         //  n_Fuck, this guy's a fighter, huh?
306090560         //  n_Don't knock him out, I want to hear him scream.
306100720         //  n_That thing ain't gonna do you no good!
306100730         //  n_I'm gonna shove that pipe up your fucking arse!
306100740         //  n_Tough guy with a weapon.
306100750         //  n_Come here, Mary!
306100751         //  n_Let's see how fucking tough you are now!
306100760         //  n_Ain't so fucking easy with just your hands now, is it?!
306100770         //  n_Hah! Gonna beat you to a pulp!
306100780         //  n_Hahaha, after I'm done with you, I'm gonna lend you to the queers!
306100790         //  Aghh!! OK, I'm done fucking around! Now you're gonna die.
306100800         //  Shit...
306100810         //  n_You're dead!
306100820         //  n_Oh... fuck...
306100830         //  Ah shit, you weren't supposed to kill him!
306100840         //  Hey, it's not like I had any other choice, alright?
306100850         //  Don't matter now. Come on, we gotta get out of here!
306100880         //  n_I'm not gonna be so gentle this time.
306100890         //  n_Get up! I'm not done with ye.
306100900         //  n_Hahahaaa. Had enough?
306100910         //  n_Is that all you've got!?
306100920         //  n_Me Ma used to hit me harder than that!
306100930         //  n_Try again, little man.
306100940         //  n_I don't think so.
306100950         //  n_Nice shot, Mary.
306100960         //  n_Again. Harder!
306101000         //  n_Now you're gonna get what's coming to ya.
306101010         //  n_This time I'll finish you.
306101020         //  n_Let's slice up that pretty face.
306101030         //  n_No guards to save you this time.
306990001         //  Things were looking up. The old man's debt was paid off, and me and Joe were making decent money. Then Henry stopped taking our calls. Didn't think much of it at the time.
307010020         //  They finally let you out, huh? Hehehe... Derek ain't here right now. Come back later.
307010030         //  Hello, Vito, is that you? I heard you...
307010040         //  Yeah, I uh... I went upstate for a while. Just got back today.
307010050         //  And this is one of the first place you visit? Ahaha! Anxious to get into trouble again, eh?
307010060         //  Oh, you mean anxious to stay out of trouble...
307010070         //  Hah, yes, of course. Ok, so what do you need?
307010080         //  What do you want - hey, Vito! I thought you were still inside!
307010090         //  Not any more. Got out early.
307010100         //  Good behavior?
307010110         //  Not exactly.  How's business?
307010120         //  Good, good.  I'm still buying cars if you're interested. Ah... Glad you're back, kid.
307010130         //  Hey, looks who's here! Long time no see. Coño, Vito! How long's it been? At least two or three years, no?
307010140         //  More like six or seven, Charlie.
307010150         //  Coño, the time, it passes away kind of fast, you know? So where you been?
307010160         //  The Big House - where did you think?
307010170         //  You were in a big house for seven years?
307010180         //  No, you know - the can, the joint, the slammer... jail!
307010190         //  Oh, coño, right, sorry, I completely forgot... But you're out now, right? Hey, congratulations!
307010200         //  So, what can I do for you, Vito?
307010210         //  Hey, look who's here! Heh... looking good, Vito! So, how was it?
307010220         //  About as much fun as a sandpaper handjob.
307010230         //  Hehe, well just be glad you weren't still in uniform. Them boys didn't have it easy.
307010240         //  Alright, you must be in the market for some hardware, right?
307010250         //  Right.
307010260         //  Let me show you what I got...
307020010         //  We'll take my car and go meet your new landlord. You do the driving so's you's can get back into the swing of things.
307020013         //  Just hope you didn't forget how to drive while you was in the can.
307020014         //  Hey, what are you worried about? It's like riding a bicycle...
307020015         //  Sure, but when you smack up your bicycle it don't cost a fortune to fix the friggin' thing.
307020016         //  Alright, alright, I get it. You're like an old lady.
307020017         //  Yeah... I sure as hell hope so. And if you ain't noticed, cars are a lot different since you went away. You'll see.
307020020         //  Your new place is just down the street, right near the boardwalk. You're gonna love it.
307020080         //  Damn, it's good to have you home.
307020090         //  I done pretty good while you was locked up, but now that you're out, the sky's the limit!
307020100         //  You seen Henry lately?
307020110         //  Nah, not for a few years now... He really felt bad about what happened, you know.
307020120         //  So what you been up to? We couldn't really talk about much when you visited me.
307020130         //  Well, after the shit Clemente and that little asshole Luca tried to pull on us, I got hooked up with the Falcone family and I started working for them.
307020140         //  Really?
307020150         //  Yeah, you'll see tonight. I told you, I got a nice surprise planned for you. But don't bother asking, 'cause I ain't gonna tell you.
307020160         //  Oh, boy...
307020170         //  Don't worry, I been planning this for weeks!
307020180         //  That's what I'm afraid of.
307020181         //  Hey, you said you learned a lot  in the can Vito. So what'd you learn? ... Besides how to play the skinflute...
307020182         //  Well, first of all, fuck you. And second, I learned a thing or two about how the uh, "business" is organized. Yeah, old Leo really taught me a lot.
307020183         //  Yeah, I heard about that right hook of yours.
307020184         //  Ah you know, there wasn't much else to do...
307020185         //  Yeah, I guess not. So, you gonna go see the old man now that you're out?
307020186         //  Yeah, but I wanna get back on my feet first. Now pipe down, will you? I wanna enjoy the music.
307020191         //  Alright, alright....
307030010         //  Aw shit, Derek's not going to take the car like this. I'm gonna have to get this thing fixed!
307030020         //  You son of a bitch! What do you think you're doing?! Police, help!
307030140         //  Aw, piece of shit! What the hell's wrong with this thing? Ugh! Agh... cost a fucking fortune to buy and another fucking fortune to fix!
307030240         //  Thief! Stop him!
307030250         //  Stop him! That prick bastard, he tried to kill me!
307030270         //  That's my car!
307030290         //  OK, Vito, move it over a bit so the crane can reach.
307030310         //  See? What did I tell you? Piece of cake.
307030330         //  Yeah? Well, I ain't never seen a piece of cake with a scratch on it like that, numbnuts.
307030340         //  Hey, that scratch was already there. Besides, it'll buff right out. You can hardly see it!
307030350         //  Yeah, well next time whether it's there already or not, you fix it before you bring it back here.
307030390         //  Hey, what the hell's this?
307030410         //  Alright... be right back.
307030420         //  Alright, now come with me, Vito, we got another appointment.
307030430         //  Vito, come on, we don't got all day!
307030440         //  OK, head to the west side, will you? And uh...
307040020         //  Good work, boys. Plenty of time to load them up before the ship leaves. Here's your money.
307040130         //  Look... Vito, now that you got a bit of cash, maybe you should think about getting a place of your own. See I got this broad uh... she likes to stay over and... we need privacy. You know what I mean, you know... don't you?
307040140         //  Wow, you know, I go away for a little while and all of a sudden I come back and Old Man Barbaro's looking to settle down?
307040150         //  Fuck you!
307040151         //  Girlfriend, huh? So what's his name?
307040152         //  Hey, you're just jealous because I can get laid without having to bend over. Anyway, I know this guy who can set you up with a nice cheap place. His name's Richard Beck. He's got a real estate office on the West Side, that's where we're headed.
307040160         //  Sure thing, Joey.
307040170         //  Hey and about tonight... we're going to a real classy joint. So buy yourself a nice suit. They won't let you in this place looking like an ex-con.
307040180         //  My kind of place.
307040200         //  Hey, uh, I'm looking to get a place and Joe Barbaro recommended you. I'm a friend of his.
307040201         //  Alright, this is close enough. Park here.
307040202         //  Go check the place out, it's on the top floor. I already paid the first month's rent for ya. And hey, the entrance to your garage is on the side street over there.
307040203         //  Thanks, Joe. I appreciate it.
307040204         //  Alright, I'll see you later. And hey - don't forget about the suit!
307040220         //  Hello! Do you need an apartment? Here's what we got:
307040262         //  Good morning, sir!
307040263         //  Uh, hello...
307040267         //  Mr. Beck is in his office. Please, go right in.
307040268         //  Thanks, sweet cheeks.
307040269         //  Excellent choice! We can go there right now, if you have the time.
307040270         //  Ok, here we are! I'm sure you'll find it to your liking; I live in a similar apartment myself.
307040272         //  And here's the bathroom - clean and modern, with all the hot water you could ever want!
307040273         //  And here is the master bedroom - and, there is the master's bed.
307040274         //  It's comfy, with room enough for two... Maybe three.
307040275         //  And it doesn't squeak - always a plus in my book.
307040276         //  I sure hope you like your new apartment, sir!
307040277         //  If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
307040278         //  Just one question - when are you leaving?
307040279         //  In that case, here are your keys.
307040280         //  Still got a few things to do...
307040281         //  I really need to get my own place. I better go see that real estate guy Joe told me about...
307040282         //  Joe said I needed a nice suit...
307040283         //  Now if you'll pardon me, I have to go and check on another client. Goodbye now!
307040284         //  Yeah, see you.
307040285         //  Sounds good to me. Let's go.
307040286         //  Don't let me keep you, sir. I'm sure you have a lot to do, and I have to wait here for another client.
307040287         //  I really hope this guy shows up soon... I've got a lot on my plate today, and the housing market is booming!
307040288         //  Alright, now I gotta call Joe...
307040289         //  Hello?
307040290         //  Hey Joe, it's me.
307040291         //  Hey! You get your own place?
307040292         //  Yup, not too shabby either.
307040293         //  Alright, put a suit on and meet me at my place. And don't take all day, we got someplace to go soon!
307040294         //  Alright, alright, I'll see you soon.
307040295         //  Alright, I'll see ya.
307040296         //  As you can see, it even comes with a telephone, at no extra charge.
307040297         //  Thank you.
307040298         //  If you have any problems at all, just give me a call.
307040299         //  Is there a problem, sir? I'm just waiting here for another client.
307040300         //  So, uh, you tell him where we're headed, Joey?
307040310         //  Nope. All he knows is that it's a surprise.
307040320         //  Hahaha... Oh, he's gonna love it.
307040330         //  I fucking hope so. Unless he got into the, uh... "funny business" in the can.
307040340         //  Hey, what are you two talking about?
307040350         //  Hehe, don't worry about it, you'll see.
307040360         //  Hey, come on, we might as well tell him now.
307040370         //  Hey, he waited this long, we'll tell him in the car.
307040380         //  Alright, let's go, Vito!
307040390         //  Hey, you know it would help if you told me where we're going.
307040400         //  Head to Oyster Bay.
307040410         //  OK, so Vito, what was the one thing you missed the most when you was in the can?
307040420         //  Freedom.
307040430         //  Yeah, but... besides that.
307040440         //  Ah, you know, uh... Booze, broads, baseball... everything.
307040450         //  Now you're getting closer! He he.
307040480         //  What, are you guys taking me to a baseball game?
307040490         //  No! We're taking you to the classiest cathouse in the city, Vito!
307040500         //  Cathouse, huh? Wow...
307040510         //  Whoa, you don't sound too excited, Vito. C'mon... Don't tell me you don't want to have some fun after all that time?
307040520         //  Hey, don't worry, Vito, these girls are real professionals. If you forgot how to do it, they'll get you back in shape in no time, hehehe.
307040530         //  Hehe, we're gonna have a ball! Hehe... Oh, hey, uh, remind me not to drink too much, there's something I gotta take care of later.
307040540         //  What's more important than pussy and booze?
307040550         //  Ah you know how it is... Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Hey Vito, come on, step on it, huh?
307040560         //  Hey, Vito! Careful with Eddie's car!
307040570         //  But what'd you forget how to drive?!
307040580         //  Hey, Vito! We need to get there in one piece, you know!
307040590         //  Hey! Hey! Easy with the car!
307040600         //  Hey, you drive like a broad, you know that, Vito?
307040610         //  Hey, Vito, open your eyes!
307040620         //  Alright, here it is! Ladies, here I come.
307040650         //  Oh, you mean Abbot and Costello here? Heh, yeah yeah, of course, they are. C'mon, let us in.
307050001         //  Hey Vito. You wanna drive? I had a couple of drinks already.
307050020         //  Hey, where the hell is my car? Somebody stole it! Hey, hey, call the fucking cops, man!
307050030         //  You're staring at it, you lush.
307050040         //  Huh? Oh, oh yeah, good. Hehehe. Hey, where's my keys?
307050050         //  Vito's gonna drive. He's the least fucked up out of all of us.
307050060         //  Yeah! Next time for us, Joe, more pussy, less booze... hehehe...
307050120         //  So, how'd you like the place, Vito?
307050130         //  Lot better than playing hide the salsiccia in the showers, huh?
307050131         //  Hahahahaha!!!
307050133         //  Aaaaah...
307050140         //  Oooph - what the hell's that stink? Eddie, you puke?
307050150         //  What?! I wouldn't puke in my own car!
307050160         //  What the - what the hell is that smell then?
307050170         //  Aw, yeah, I'm smelling it too.
307050200         //  Must be Frankie Pots...
307050201         //  What, that asshole puked in your car?
307050202         //  Ah, naw, he's in the trunk.
307050210         //  What?!
307050220         //  What?!
307050230         //  Hey, it's all your fault, Joey! I told you I had some fucking business to take care of, and you went and got me drunk!
307050240         //  Hey - since when does "business to take care of" mean "dead guy in the trunk?"
307050290         //  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa - hey, calm down, Vito. Hey - aspetta. We'll figure something out.
307050300         //  What's to figure? All we gotta do is bury the stiff. I already got a spot picked out up by the old observatory.
307050310         //  Ooooh... You got a shovel?
307050320         //  Sure, it's in the trunk. And the hole is already dug. All we need to do is chuck him in and cover him up.
307050330         //  Alright, alright, where's this hole?
307050340         //  A little ways outside of town, there's a path in the forest to a small clearing. That's where the hole is. And hurry it up, will you? God, I need some fresh air. The stench back here is fucking killing me!
307050350         //  Ugh... oh... ah... Stop! Now! I'm gonna hurl! Ugh...
307050360         //  Blaaargh ...
307050361         //  Blaaargh ... Jesus, where's this shit coming from? Oh shit... Whoa, I don't remember eating calamari...
307050370         //  Hehehehehe, can't hold your booze, can you?
307050380         //  Oh too late, Vi...
307050390         //  Ahhh, Christ, Eddie! That fucking reeks.
307050400         //  Aw... Hey, it's his car.
307050410         //  Yeah, but that smell... plus the other smell... The only way it can get worse now is if he craps himself.
307050411         //  Don't even say it!
307050420         //  What are you, nuts? Are you just going to leave Eddie back there? Turn around and pick him up!
307050430         //  Go back and pick him up.
307050435         //  Hey, all that sperm they pumped up your ass in the joint make you retarded?!
307050440         //  Shit, we gotta go get Eddie!
307050450         //  Christ, what the hell are you doing? I... I thought you were gonna leave me here.
307050460         //  Right here... Oh, this is it.
307050470         //  Alright, alright, c'mon. Let's... let's get this over with, let's do it.
307050681         //  Ah! Hey... I love this song! Hey, hey, Joe, you know this one?
307050682         //  Of course...
307050683         //  Alright, alright... help me out here, huh?
307050684         //  n_ singing
307050685         //  n_ singing
307050686         //  Hey! What'd you do that for?! What's the matter, you don't like my singing? Ah, Vito... just for that I ain't gonna sing no more. You really ruined it, you know?
307050687         //  n_ snoring sounds, drunken mumbling
307050688         //  n_ snoring sounds, drunken mumbling
307050689         //  n_ snoring sounds, drunken mumbling
307050691         //  n_ snoring sounds, drunken mumbling
307050698         //  Nah, no point in going there... They're probably sleeping.
307050699         //  Ah, I should go home and get some sleep too.
307050701         //  Now that was one hell of a day... Feels nice to be back in the saddle... Good old Joe...
307050703         //  You guys kidding me with this?
307050704         //  Oh my God... poor Dino.
307050706         //  Should have buried myself in that fucking grave...
307050707         //  My God, it sounds like you're strangling a cat back there!
307050708         //  Oh! My ears!
307050709         //  Oh my God... you guys couldn't carry a tune if it was bolted to your chest!
307050720         //  Probably not a good idea to steal Eddie's car...
308010451         //  Who the hell was that? Guy's got a voice like Woody Fucking Woodpecker...
308010460         //  That was Marty. Remember the little kid used to live down the street from me? I had to pick up the truck here so he gave me a lift.
308010470         //  What's going on with the truck?
308010480         //  It's gonna make us some nice cash. Hop in, I'll explain on the way. You drive.
308010490         //  Where to?
308010500         //  Riverside.
308010510         //  Alright, Riverside it is.
308010520         //  So what's the deal?
308010530         //  It's simple. We just gotta go to a couple of places and unload these smokes. Then we bring the truck back to Eddie and get our cut of the take. Piece of cake.
308010540         //  Wait a minute. I seem to remember getting thrown in the clink for a "piece of cake" just like this...
308010550         //  Don't worry. I done this before. First stop: Riverside.
308010560         //  If you say so...
308010570         //  Trust me, you're gonna thank me later.
308010571         //  Some night, huh?
308010572         //  Yeah, you could say that.
308010573         //  What, you ain't still mad, are you?
308010574         //  Na, burying a stiff... that's the first thing I wanted to do when I got out.
308010575         //  Hey, come on...  You had fun at the cathouse, right?
308010576         //  Yeah, yeah, I did... And thank you for that...  But uh, everything between then and now, not so much.
308010577         //  Alright, alright... Well, listen, today's gonna be a lot better. I promise.
308010578         //  I sure as hell hope so...
308010700         //  So the kid Marty, he works for Eddie too?
308010710         //  Aa ha, in his dreams. Kid's not even eighteen yet. He does jobs for me, drives me around, makes deliveries, that sort of stuff. Thinks he's a gangster, though. Spends too much damn time at the movies.
308010720         //  Well, if the kid's got you for a role model he's in for a lot of trouble.
308010730         //  Oh yeah, wiseguy? He reminds me a lot of you when you was his age.
308010740         //  Exactly. And I spent two years dodging bullets in Europe and six years in the can since I met you. That's what I mean by trouble.
308010750         //  What's the matter, somebody shit in your coffee this morning? It's like you forgot about all the good times.
308010760         //  Yeah, remind of those someday, would ya?
308040170         //  Hi, I'll take a box of Reds.
308040180         //  Hi, one carton of Reds.
308040200         //  Hey! Good to see you, I'm all out of smokes. Give me a carton of Blues.
308040220         //  Hey, a carton of Blues if you please.
308040240         //  Give me, uh... one carton of Whites.
308040260         //  Hand me a carton of Reds, Vito!
308040270         //  Give me a carton of Blues.
308040280         //  One carton of Whites, Vito.
308040290         //  Carton of Reds, Vito.
308040300         //  One carton of Blues, Vito.
308040310         //  Throw me a carton of Whites.
308040320         //  Move it, Vito. A carton of Reds!
308040330         //  Uh, Vito, can you hand me that carton of Blues?
308040340         //  You hear me, Vito? A carton of Whites!
308040350         //  Vito! Wake up and throw a carton of Reds!
308040360         //  Hey, hand me a carton of Blues!
308040370         //  Vito! Where's the carton of Whites?
308040380         //  Here it is, sir. You're welcome, come again.
308040381         //  You're welcome.
308040382         //  Come again.
308040390         //  Here it is.
308040400         //  Here.
308040410         //  Oh! Wake up! What do I gotta do, drop the soap to get some attention around here?
308040411         //  Yeah, that's the one!
308040412         //  Alright, hand it over!
308040413         //  Bingo!
308040414         //  That's more like it!
308040415         //  See, I knew you could do it!
308040420         //  What are you up to, Joe?
308040421         //  Are you deaf or what? I said carton of Blues!
308040422         //  Blues! Carton of Blues! Dammit, Vito, pay attention!
308040423         //  Not this one! I said Reds! Jeez, Vito!
308040424         //  What?! You think this is funny? I said I need Reds!
308040425         //  Is something wrong with your eyes, Vito? Give me a carton of Whites, for chrissake!
308040426         //  Oh... Madonna mia, Vito, c'mon, huh?! I need Whites! Let's go! Chop chop!
308040430         //  Hey Sarge, how you doing?! Carton of Blues, as usual?
308040440         //  Uh, I think I'll take... the Whites this time.
308040450         //  You hear that, Vito, let's go! Carton of Whites.
308040460         //  Thanks, Joe. Now, get the hell out of here, will you?
308040470         //  Sure thing, pleasure doing business with you, officer.
308040480         //  OK, time to go. Get in, Vito. Next stop is Millville.
308040490         //  It's going great today. We're making some serious dough here.
308040491         //  See, what'd I tell you? It's going like butter today.
308040492         //  Alright, this almost makes up for last night...  Almost.
308040493         //  C'mon, what's better than this? You got fresh air, good company, and you're making a shitload of dough. Not too bad for a guy who just got out of the slammer.
308040494         //  Alright, alright. Listen, if the next few hours are anything like the last few hours, all's forgiven.
308040495         //  There's the Vito I know. Alright, we'll be there in a sec.
308040502         //  n_Hey... wh... hey... What happened to it!?
308040503         //  n_What are you talking about?
308040504         //  n_My hooch. It's gone! You drank it, didn't you, Randolph?
308040505         //  n_What? I did no such thing!
308040506         //  n_You're always drinking my hooch. It's giving me a damn headache!
308040507         //  n_I wanted to drink it, but you drank it before I could. You lush. That's why you have a headache!
308040508         //  n_What... what are you talking about? I only had a few sips. You drank the rest of it, I know you did!
308040509         //  n_You've always been a nasty drunk, Mortimer.
308040510         //  Hehehehe....A'hey, look who's here, ahehe? And where the hell you been, laying around in bed all day?
308040520         //  Hey I'm entitled to a little rest after that last job, don't you think?
308060010         //  Alright, let's get one of these fucks and teach him a lesson!
308060380         //  I got it floored, Joe. This thing won't go any faster.
308060385         //  Ah shit... now what?
308060395         //  Step on it Vito, he's getting away!
308060400         //  Eddie, it's me, Vito. Listen, we got a problem. We were moving the smokes, and then these, uh, these greasers came out of nowhere and set the fucking truck on fire...
308060410         //  What!? You fucking kidding me?! You couldn't handle a bunch of greaseballs? What the fuck happened?
308060420         //  Look, look, Eddie! Eddie! Hey, listen - it's not our fault, OK? They set the fucking truck on fire before we knew what was happening and everything burned up. Alright, we popped one of the guys, but...
308060450         //  What do I fucking care?! Just bring me my money! I paid two grand for that truck and I want it back...
308060471         //  Lucky for you two retards, I got Derek's guy Steve here with me, and we were just talking about what to do with those punks. We're gonna take care of them, now. Steve will meet you at the Crazy Horse - you know it?
308060480         //  OK, Crazy Horse, yeah, I know where it is.
308060490         //  Steve's gonna have a few guys with him. Show 'em that nobody fucks with us. No shooting though, so it looks like just another gang fight. I don't wanna read about a bloodbath in the papers tomorrow.
308060500         //  Alright, sure, Eddie. Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
308060510         //  Alright, we gotta meet Steve in front of the Crazy Horse. The good news is that he's gonna help us out. The bad news is Eddie wants his money back. All two grand of it.
308060520         //  Shit. You really think we're gonna get two G's out of these guys?
308060521         //  Shit... We should check with Eddie. Stop at the nearest phone booth and call him.
308060530         //  I don't know. We'll see what Steve's got in mind. You know he ain't doing this out of the kindness of his heart. Let's go.
308060800         //  Ah, Eddie was fucking PISSED on the phone.
308060810         //  Sure he was. Just like I'm pissed right now. Even if these assholes ain't got a dime I'm gonna kick two thousand-dollars worth of shit out of 'em.
308060820         //  Ah, I'm with you. But what's Steve doing working for Eddie? He works for Derek, and Derek's with Vinci's crew.
308060830         //  How the hell should I know? But hey, you're still gonna take jobs from Derek, right? Even though you're working for Eddie? We all gotta do what we gotta do to get by...
308060840         //  What the hell is Steve doing bringing Marty in on this?
308060850         //  Maybe Steve was hoping he'd get his jaw broken. Give us all a few months of peace.
308060860         //  Hey, cut Marty some slack, would ya? He's a good kid.
308060870         //  Hey, good kid or not, this ain't the kind a thing he should be involved in.
308060880         //  Tell me somethin' I don't know. I'll look out for him though, don't worry.
308080010         //  I told you, stay out of the way!
308080020         //  Move it, you crazy fuck!
308080030         //  You want me to blast your ass?
308080040         //  Hahahaha, that's fucking beautiful!
308080050         //  Ah hahahahaha! Yeah! Yeah! Haha!
308080060         //  Oooops! Hahahahaha!
308080070         //  OK, that's enough!
308080080         //  Let's leave 'em a little present. Vito, Marty, I got some Molotov cocktails in the trunk. Go get 'em and throw 'em in.
308080090         //  Heh, my pleasure, Steve!
308080100         //  Hmph, nrgh! That'll teach 'em! Hahahaha!
308080110         //  What are you waiting for? Grab the bottle and chuck it in! It ain't that hard.
308080120         //  Fucking retard... Never mind now, looks like we made our point.
308080125         //  Yeah! Hehe.
308080130         //  Alright, now we go to the foundry.
308080140         //  Get in, boys.
308080150         //  We'll meet you two at the main gate.
308080160         //  See you there.
308080161         //  Come on, Vito.
308080162         //  Let's go!
308080170         //  OK, let's do this.
308080271         //  I still got work to do.
308080272         //  I can't just leave the guys here.
308080273         //  We're not done here yet.
308080274         //  I gotta find a way to pay Eddie back before I leave.
308080275         //  Where the hell you think you're going, Vito?
308080276         //  Hey. We ain't done yet, numbnuts.
308080277         //  Hey Vito, get back here! Job ain't over yet.
308080361         //  n_Fucking pansy-ass dirtbags!
308080362         //  n_C'mon! That all you got?
308080363         //  n_Haha! Real tough guys, huh?
308080364         //  n_Yeah! And I got some more for you right here!
308080365         //  n_Not so tough now, are you?
308080370         //  n_What the fuck?
308080371         //  n_Come on, bitch!
308080372         //  n_Yeeeaaahhh!!!
308080373         //  n_Yeah, that'll teach you!
308080374         //  n_Oh, ouch! That had to hurt!
308080375         //  n_Don't be so gentle, boys!!
308080376         //  n_You want some more? Here - you got some more!
308080380         //  n_Shit, let's go!
308080390         //  n_Hahaha... Let's get them!
308080410         //  n_Hey assholes, don't split up! Ah fuck it, who cares.
308080411         //  n_Aaaaah!
308080412         //  n_Uaaaah!
308080413         //  n_Ahhhh, shit!
308080414         //  n_Leave me alone! I ain't with these guys, I swear!
308080415         //  n_Please, no, c'mon!
308080416         //  n_Ah crap! I... I didn't sign up for this!
308100060         //  n_Aaaaah!
308100070         //  n_Uaaaah! Ahh!
308100080         //  n_Ruuuuun!
308100090         //  n_They got guns!
308100100         //  n_Don't kill me, please!
308100110         //  n_I'm out of here, man!
308100120         //  n_We are so fucked!
308100130         //  n_They gonna kill us all!
308100140         //  n_Man, I don't want to die!
308100150         //  n_Shoot these assholes!
308100160         //  n_See you in hell!
308100170         //  n_Eat lead, assholes!
308100180         //  n_Aaaaha, haha!
308100190         //  n_Aaaahahahaha!
308100200         //  n_Die, die, die!
308100210         //  n_Just die already!
308100220         //  n_Now you're gonna die!
308100230         //  n_What does it take to kill you for chrissakes?
308100240         //  n_Oh, I ain't going out like this!
308100250         //  n_This just ain't fair!
308100260         //  n_Uh... I don't want to die!
308100270         //  n_Take 'em down quick or we're fucked!
308120010         //  Shit, where are we gonna get the two G's for Eddie?
308120020         //  You got any idea how much a car like this goes for?
308120030         //  What? Why...
308120040         //  Damn, Vito, you're a genius! These babies ain't cheap, right? I bet Derek would give us at least a grand for that one.
308120050         //  Alright, I'm gonna drive this baby over to Derek's. I'll meet you back at the Falcon.
308120140         //  Sounds like a plan. I'll see you at the bar.
308120150         //  n_Fuck, I guess I gotta find some other way to get the money now.
308120160         //  n_I ain't taking that piece of shit. Get it off my docks, will you?
308120170         //  n_Alright... be right back.
308120180         //  n_Thank you.
308140010         //  Eddie's not gonna be too happy if I show up without the money. I better wait 'til I got all of it.
308140011         //  I need to sell this car, not put it in storage. I need the money for Eddie.
308990001         //  Twenty-four hours out of the joint and I'd stolen a few cars, got myself hooked up with the Falcone family, and buried a stiff... So much for rehabilitation. (Marty shouts out)
309010010         //  Hello?
309010020         //  Yeah, Vito? We got a situation here. Grab a gun and meet me at the bar. And make sure you're driving a decent set of wheels.
309010030         //  Alright, I'll be right there.
309010040         //  There goes my Sunday.
309010041         //  This is official police business.  Please step aside.
309010042         //  This doesn't concern you, pal. Beat it.
309010043         //  What's going on here is none of your business. Get out of here.
309010044         //  Hey buddy, you're interfering with an official investigation.  Take a hike.
309010050         //  Vito, what the hell you waiting for? I already told you all you need to know.
309010060         //  We don't got time for this, Vito! Go!
309010070         //  Move your ass, Vito! These guys are gonna get killed 'cause of your fucking around.
309010080         //  So, what'd you find out?
309010090         //  Nothing yet.
309010100         //  Why the fuck are you here? Get to Freddy's and tail Luca to find out what he's up to!
309010110         //  Still nothing? Come on, Vito, you gotta move!
309010120         //  Hey, why the fuck are you still here?
309010130         //  Vito, this is important! Move your ass already, will you!
309010150         //  n_Open up, police.
309010160         //  n_Listen, we know you're in there.
309010170         //  n_This is the police. Open up!
309010180         //  n_We just wanna ask you some questions!
309010190         //  n_If you don't open the door, we're gonna open it up for you.
309010200         //  n_So open up!
309010210         //  n_This is the police, this is your last warning... Open the goddamned door!
309010220         //  Hey, fellas. What's going on?
309020040         //  I shouldn't get too close. I gotta make sure Luca doesn't see me.
309020050         //  OK, I gotta get in there without being seen.
309020060         //  I can't let anybody see me until I find out what happened to our guys.
309020080         //  Jesus Christ, that reeks!
309020100         //  Looks like I can pry this off.
309020140         //  Agh, ugh... Ghrrr... Oh, Jesus Christ, that's disgusting!
309020141         //  Aw, fuck, this is gross!
309020142         //  Oh, this fucking reeks.
309020143         //  God... can't believe I'm fucking doing this...
309020150         //  Shit! Oh, for fuck's sake!
309020170         //  Jesus Christ, I'm never going to be able to get this fucking stench off me!
309020180         //  Well, did you find 'em?
309020190         //  Not exactly. I tailed Luca to Clemente's slaughterhouse, but there's no way I could get inside without someody seeing me.
309020200         //  The slaughterhouse? Yeah, yeah, they could be there... But we gotta know for sure.
309020210         //  You gotta get inside and find our guys. I don't care if you gotta go through the sewers, you gotta find a way in!
309020220         //  Ok, I'll try. Sewers... that could work...
309020230         //  There's gotta be some way to get in there, check everywhere.
309020240         //  We gotta be sure before we make a direct move, so find a way into that fucking slaughterhouse.
309020250         //  What, do you want me to hold your hand? Get over there and find a way in!
309020260         //  Not a good idea. This is the car I'm supposed to follow!
309020270         //  Oh shit! I hit Luca's car!
309020280         //  I'm getting too close.
309020290         //  He'll notice me, I gotta slow down.
309020300         //  I'm too close to him!
309020310         //  I'm losing him.
309020320         //  I gotta step on it, he's getting away.
309020330         //  Can't lose him now... I gotta get closer.
309020340         //  Shit! He got away! I ain't gonna find him now...
309020350         //  Where you going, Luca? Riverside?
309020360         //  Bruski's junkyard maybe? Na, Mike doesn't get involved in shit like this...
309020370         //  Clemente's slaughterhouse. Of course!
309020380         //  Looks like Eddie was right...
309020390         //  Whoa, wrong way. I gotta find a way in.
309020400         //  Where am I going? I gotta find a way in there!
309020409         //  I should try that whole in the fence.
309020410         //  The sewer! Maybe that's the way in...
309020420         //  Sorry, forgot my bathing suit.
309020430         //  n_They don't know that I know that they know that I know...
309020440         //  n_They still scream, all of them, can't shake them, can't break them can't take them, why?!
309020450         //  n_They say that I say that they say that I'm crazy, but I know that they know that I know...
309020460         //  n_They're bad, they're bad, they're all bad, I can hear them scream...
309020470         //  n_Can't forget, must forget... They say I forgot, but no no no no no no! I still remember... All of them!
309020480         //  n_Drink... I need a drink. Happy, happy in the throat...
309020490         //  n_It's all connected! I know, I saw, I told, but they laughed and scorned and cursed.
309020500         //  n_Rats and rats, always coming, they want to steal, but I won't give it, it's mine, I will drink it...
309020510         //  n_Are you them or are they you... or are they me?
309020520         //  n_Dollar, give me a dollar for a dog's collar so I can tell hounds from scholar...
309020530         //  n_Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me - that's what's in you pockets, is it drink or stink? No drink... but a stink will come!
309020540         //  n_It's mine, all mine, I won't give it, I won't share it, I... I'll drink it. Go away, away! Or I'll call them...
309020550         //  n_Still following me, but I won't tell you, never never never never...
309020560         //  n_They chases me away and sends the sneaksy manfool to take it, but you won't ...
309020570         //  Uh... Yeah. Hello?
309020580         //  Rooooaooooooaoaoaaaaaaaa!...
309020590         //  Ah... I see.
309020600         //  The b-b-best... best things in life are f-f-free. B-b-but you, you can k-k-keep 'em for the b-b-birds and bees. Now, give me the money... that's what I w-w-want...that's what I want.
309020610         //  OK... Well, uh... I'll see you then.
309020620         //  No, they see! And they seek! But I won't give, no no no no...
309020630         //  Here you go, buddy.
309020640         //  Uh... General Washington! Hello again, sir.
309020650         //  Alright, don't spend it all in one place, huh?
309020660         //  I guess there's no point asking this guy for directions. Sounds like Joe when he's shitfaced...
309020670         //  Argh... Should've taken my chances ringing the doorbell.
309020680         //  Fuck, if I knew I'd have to go through this shit...
309020690         //  Argh... If Luca doesn't kill me, this smell will...
309020700         //  I never should've picked up that fucking phone.
309020710         //  Aw, fuck! That's the end of these clothes...
309020720         //  Argh... now what'd I step in?
309020730         //  Shit, that dog could be a problem...
309020740         //  Shut up, you mutt! What's wrong with you?!
309020750         //  Agh, fuck!
309020760         //  Argh... if Luca just stopped by to pick up some steaks, I'm gonna kill somebody.
309020800         //  n_
309020810         //  n_
309020820         //  Uh, excuse me...
309020830         //  Yeah, can I help you?
309020840         //  You know how to get into the slaughterhouse over here?
309020850         //  And, uh... What would you be looking for in there?
309020860         //  Yeah, my dog ran in there. I'm trying to find him.
309020870         //  Your dog, huh?
309020880         //  Yeah. You know how to get inside or what?
309020890         //  First of all, let me tell you something - you are a terrible liar. And second of all, unless your dog has keys to that building, the only way he could've got in is through the sewer.
309020900         //  Sewer, huh? Alright, thanks.
309030020         //  n_You know, I was gonna go down to the track today, and Luca calls and says to come here. Fucked my whole Sunday!
309030030         //  n_You got a good tip or something?
309030040         //  n_Yeah, friend of mine gave me the name of a sure thing. Bet I would have won a fortune.
309030050         //  n_Ah, that's too bad. Me, I was gonna take Kelly out.
309030060         //  n_Hey, I thought your wife's name was Marie?
309030070         //  n_It is. Kelly's that Irish broad from Jersey. The girl can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch...
309030071         //  n_Hehe, well, at least  I'm not the only one missing out on a sure thing. Why don't we go see how Luca's doing with his new friends.
309030190         //  C'mon, get us down, will you? What are you doing? Get us off these damn hooks!
309030191         //  Oh, for crying out loud... Will you get me down, please?!
309030192         //  Oh... get me down, will you!
309030194         //  Oh... thank you. I thought we were dead!
309030200         //  Thanks, Vito. We owe you one. Eddie send you?
309030210         //  Yeah, he noticed he was a couple of guys shy at roll call.
309030220         //  Shit... poor Frankie. I'm gonna kill that son-of-a-bitch.
309030240         //  Alright, let's go. I gotta see a man about a meathook...
309030250         //  Beans, stay here... and don't come out until we come get you.
309030260         //  OK, OK. Just don't forget about me. OK, fellas?
309030301         //  Kill him, you idiots!
309030400         //  What's going on, they dead yet?!
309030410         //  Yeah, they are. And guess who's next!?
309030440         //  A lot of guys with a lot of guns are already on their way over here. And they can't wait to put you back on that hook.
309030490         //  Shit, too late! Here they come!
309030500         //  We'll have to take 'em out!
309030501         //  God damnit, get away from the window, Vito!
309030502         //  They're coming inside! We gotta move!
309030503         //  Fuck, look at this, it's like a regular asshole convention in here.
309030504         //  Aww, Christ, what is this?
309030505         //  How many of these idiots are there?
309030530         //  Ok, boys, find those bastards and kill 'em. Then we grab Luca and get out of here. Go, go, go, move it!
309030540         //  Finally! What took you so fucking long? Kill those motherfuckers! There's only two of 'em.  One smells like shit and the other one's a retard. They ain't got a chance!
309030560         //  Alright. Nice job. Now let's go get that little cocksucker...
309030570         //  Yeah, before he makes any more fucking phone calls...
309030580         //  Knock knock. C'mon, let me in.
309030620         //  Fuck you! Come on, just try and get in!
309030630         //  Ha! Can't do it, can you? Aw, that's too fucking bad!
309030640         //  Shit, I ain't gonna be able to open it like this.
309030650         //  Yeah, we need something heavy like a... like a battering ram.
309030660         //  I know! We'll use that cart!
309030680         //  Ahh shit, it's too light. We'll have to load it up with something heavy... Hey, I got an idea... give me a hand!
309030750         //  What the hell are you waiting for, Vito?
309030756         //  Come on, assholes, I'm all yours!
309030758         //  So uh, how'd they get you?
309030759         //  They was waiting for us over at Beans's place. Must've been watching us for a while.
309030760         //  What was Luca trying to get out of you anyway?
309030761         //  Nothing. Let's just call it uh... a family secret.
309030762         //  Right now let's just concentrate on killing that little prick.
309030763         //  Not for nothing Vito... but you know you smell like shit, right?
309030764         //  Really? I didn't notice... Just be happy I decided to save your ass instead of taking a bath first!
309030765         //  Hey, did I say I wasn't grateful? I'll take being rescued by a guy who smells like shit over being thrown in the meatgrinder any day of the week...
309030766         //  Yeah, yeah, you're welcome... now c'mon, let's keep moving.
309030800         //  I gotta hide, otherwise they'll see me... Oh shit, another dog!
309030810         //  Jesus, would you shut up! What, is somebody there?
309030820         //  There's nobody there, see?! So shut up before we turn you into meatloaf!
309030830         //  Lousy mutt...
309030831         //  What's going on over there?
309030832         //  I better take a look...
309030840         //  Move it, assholes!
309030850         //  Shit, there they are... Now I got you, you skinny little prick...
309030860         //  OK, time to move...
309030880         //  Hey! Who the fuck are you! Hey!
309030890         //  Hey! What the hell are you doing here?!
309030900         //  Ah, shit! We got a visitor!
309030910         //  Hey, who's that?! Stop!
309030920         //  Hey! You! Who the hell are you!
309030930         //  Guys! There's somebody here!
309030940         //  Hey, I see you, asshole!
309030950         //  Whoever you are, you're in deep shit now!
309030960         //  Hey, stop right there!
309031030         //  n_Hey, don't spend all day out here, huh? I don't want to do this by myself!
309031040         //  n_Just having one fucking smoke. Relax.
309031050         //  n_Yeah, heard that one before, pal.
309031060         //  So, uh, what's going on with them guys?
309031070         //  Don't know what you're talking about.
309031080         //  Hey, I seen some strange shit around here, but...
309031090         //  You ain't seen nothing, ain't heard nothing, ain't gonna talk about nothing. Got it?
309031100         //  Yeah, yeah... uh, forget I asked, alright?
309031110         //  n_Hey, what was that screaming?
309031120         //  n_Nothing. One of them pigs must've squeeled.
309031130         //  n_What? Na, that was no pig, that sounded like -
309031140         //  n_You got shit in your ears? That was a pig! Just ignore it.
309031150         //  n_Yeah, but -
309031160         //  n_Hey, you new around here or what?! Shut the fuck up, and get back to work, or that ain't gonna be the only pig that's squeeling.
309031170         //  n_OK, OK...
309031290         //  Hey! Everything OK out there?
309031300         //  Yeah! It's all good boss.
309031310         //  Get over here then, I need your help with something!
309031320         //  Uh, be right there!
309031500         //  n_Enough fucking around! Finish 'em already!
309031510         //  n_Hey - how many hours in a day you think I got to wait for you to kill these guys!?
309031520         //  n_What's taking so damn long?
309031530         //  n_There's only two of 'em! How hard could it be!?
309031535         //  n_You want us to shoot him, boss?
309031540         //  n_Na, let Sammy have his fun first.
309031545         //  n_Let's go, kill him, Sammy!  And try not to make such a big mess this time.
309031550         //  n_C'mon, break his fucking neck, Sammy!
309031555         //  n_C'mon, Sammy, not so gentle.
309031560         //  n_Hah, I'd hate to be you right now, asshole!
309031570         //  n_This guy sure can take a beating, huh? This is gonna be a messy one.
309031575         //  n_Oh! That had to hurt.
309031580         //  n_Atta boy Sammy!
309031585         //  Boys! Take care of him!
309031600         //  Why the hell are we here? I got better shit to do on a weekend.
309031610         //  How the fuck should I know? Luca says to be here, we gotta be here.
309031620         //  Something big's gotta be going down. He sounded even more pissed off than usual on the phone.
309031630         //  Yeah, well it better not take long. Last weekend he had us here I missed Sunday dinner. I gotta be out of here at four o'clock today no matter what.
309031640         //  Better not be thinking about skipping out early. You know what Luca'll do to you if he finds out?
309031650         //  You kidding me? I'm more afraid of what my grandmother's gonna do to me if I don't show up again.
309031660         //  Hey, let's go see if Luca's here yet.
309031670         //  Alright.
309031680         //  n_Hey, he's here already. Who's them guys with him?
309031690         //  n_Hey, that's Tony Balls. One of the Falcone guys.
309031700         //  n_No shit?
309031710         //  n_Yeah. What the fuck is going on? Don't look like Tony came here voluntarily.
309031720         //  n_Hey, who's the little guy?
309031730         //  n_Dunno. Never seen him before.
309031740         //  n_Fuck. I hope the boss knows what he's doing here.
309031750         //  n_Of course the boss knows what Luca's doing. Something like this... Luca couldn't do it all by himself. The boss'd have to give the order.
309031760         //  n_That's what I meant, you retard. I hope the boss knows what he's doing here. This is gonna start a war.
309031770         //  n_So what?
309031780         //  n_So - my days tend to go better when I ain't getting shot at or getting rid of bodies.
309031790         //  n_Hey, some nights it's broads and poker games, other nights you gotta run a stiff through the meat grinder. What are you gonna do.
309031800         //  n_Try not to get killed. That's what I'm gonna do.
309031810         //  n_Alright, alright, enough already.
309031820         //  n_Hey, you know that guy, works over at Carlo Falcone's joint?
309031830         //  n_Which guy? I ain't been there in a while.
309031840         //  n_The one who got into trouble with the shylocks, and now he's only got two fingers on one of his hands. What's his name...
309031850         //  n_You mean Mickey the Lobster?
309031860         //  n_Na na, his name's uh... Mickey uh... Mickey the Crab.
309031870         //  n_Yeah, Mickey the Lobster, Mickey the Crab - same guy.
309031880         //  n_Oh. I guess that makes sense. Alright, yeah, so Mickey the Crab. I was thinking... which hand you think he uses to uh, spank the salami.
309031890         //  n_What? What kind of fucking question is that?
309031900         //  n_Hey, I was just wondering.
309031905         //  n_About some fucking... cripple wacking off? You're fucking sick, you know that? Just... just shut up and don't talk to me anymore today. Jesus Christ.
309031910         //  n_Alright, fine, fine. See if I answer a question next time you got one.
309031915         //  n_So, uuh... you still thinking about quitting?
309031920         //  n_Yeah. Probably next month.
309031925         //  n_And what you're gonna do then?
309031930         //  n_Well, I was thinking of maybe... you know... becoming a voice actor...
309031935         //  n_You kidding me? Who the hell would hire you?
309031940         //  n_Hey, you two. Shift's over.
309031945         //  n_W-What do you mean shift's over?
309031950         //  n_You got shit in your ears? I said you're done for today.
309031955         //  n_...but I ain't done pounding the beefsteak.
309031960         //  n_Hey, don't make me say it again. Shift's over. Get the hell out of here.
309031965         //  n_Alright, fine by me.
309031970         //  n_Damn straight. Let's go.
309032001         //  Ha ha ha, reminds me of the old days.
309032002         //  Come on, you cocksuckers.
309032003         //  Go ahead, Vito, I got your back.

309032005         //  Die, assholes!!!

309032007         //  One more to go.
309032008         //  You fucked with the wrong guys, assholes!
309032009         //  Come on Vito, let's get 'em.
309032010         //  Hehehe...
309032011         //  Fuck you! You missed me.
309032012         //  Uaaaaaaahahaha!
309032013         //  You OK, Vito?
309032014         //  Not bad, kid. Not bad.
309032015         //  Alright, Vito. Let's get that little fuck!
309032016         //  Little cocksucker's gonna piss his pants!

309050010         //  Vito, go get cleaned up, will you? You smell like freaking dogshit.
309050020         //  Vito, c'mon, huh? You have any idea how bad you reek?
309050030         //  Get out of here for chrissakes. I want to light a cigarette but I'm afraid if I do you'll fucking explode.
309990001         //  The thing at the Foundry must've really impressed Eddie. Every couple days he'd call me in for something. At first it was just small-time stuff, but eventually it led to some...  bigger jobs.  (phone rings)

31_56_60_0001     //  Welcome back to civilization, buddy! When you were having your fun in the south, I took care of your apartment and other stuff. I left a car for you outside the station, so you can drive around and see what's new. Just keep a low profile. Five years is still not long enough for some people to forget what you've done. When you're done sightseeing, you can get back to work. I'm sure there are people around here who might have some interesting jobs for you.
31_56_60_0101     //  Joe! Heard you were back in town. Just in fuckin' time! Gotta big problem here I need you on. Some greaseball I hired just got pinched and ratted me out. Way that little shit's talkin' my buddy at the station says I ain't got long before I'm gonna have cops crawling all over my ass. I been havin' Giuseppe workin' on a set of papers for most of the cars in this lot. Even the ones I actually bought. Looks like I need 'em now. You get you're ass down to him fast, you bring 'em back, and I'll make it worth it for ya'. You used to make a lot of cash off this place Joe. You owe me on this.
31_56_60_0102     //  Joe! Heard you were back in town. The way your lookin', I'm thinkin' you could use some cash. I got just the thing for ya'. Uncle Sam's payin' big dough for steel these days, what with us just blowin' up half the world and all. I cut a sweet deal on an order of scrap, but I'm short, and gotta deliver real soon. I figure 'bout three cars oughta do it. You grab me the cars, we run 'em through the Beast, and we make some money. Any old piece of shit will do, just get it for me now.
31_56_60_0103     //  Joe, you still up for making some cash? Got an order for a Berkley Kingfisher from some young punk downtown. Crazy sonnavabitch wants it red with a white roof, and he wants it today. Tell you what, from what I plan on chargin' this guy, I'll give ya' double the usual, that is, if you can get it here before he finds somebody else dumb enough to pull this off. And Joe, if I'm gonna move this thing, it's gotta be perfect. You get one scratch on it, and the whole thing's off. Try drivin' with your eyes open for a change.
31_56_60_0104     //  Some little shitbag that bought a Kingfisher from me, fucked up good. The asshole used the car in a fuckin' job, and then runs when the goddamn cops show up. Joe, the cops got that car in holding right now. They start looking around, and it's gonna make a lot of people we know nervous. You find that car and make it disappear, or it'll be both our asses!
31_56_60_0201     //  Hey, Joe. Had to call in a favor to get you this so don't fuck it up. We got this thing goin' on with Derek. Hot cars and shit. Should be a lot of dough in it for all of us. But we gotta get rid of the competition first. Couple of little punks, too stupid to know who they dealin' with, set up shop in some warehouse in Millville. You get down there and light the place up good. Take 'em out of business and we'll take care of you. Poor sons of bitches won't know what hit them.
31_56_60_0202     //  You ain't gonna believe this one. Just got a call from the Maltese Falcon. Seems some jerkoff cop just come in threatenin' the whole operation. Got some photos or somethin' and wants a cut of everything. Little prick has some balls. Too bad you gotta kick em' in. Get your ass down to the Falcon, follow this prick home, and have a talk with him. Whatever you do with the guy, you make sure you get the photos. And he better still be breathin' when you're done. He might come in handy for some jobs we got comin' up.
31_56_60_0203     //  Hey, this car thing's startin' to pay off. Be surprised how many of these rich bastards are cheaper than the shylocks downtown. Just got an order for a limo at our, uh, discount prices. Find it, bring it to the dock so we can move it fast and you'll get your cut. But Joe, these downtown pricks want it perfect. You scratch it up and you get shit.
31_56_60_0204     //  Joe! Got word a couple of shitbags are tryin' to move something big through the port without us knowin'! That's gonna change real soon. Get your ass down there and find out what their little secret is. Bring whatever you find to our garage in Chinatown. And hey Joe, if some of them get hurt along the way, even better.
31_56_60_0301     //  Joe, got a little situation here. Seems some fuck got a little too hands on with my number one girl at the cathouse last night. Scared her so bad she's refusin' to go to work. I ain't got time for this domestic shit, Joe. I want ya' to head to this fuck's place today, and make sure he understands the rules. Don't go doing nothin' too crazy though, guys one of our best customers.
31_56_60_0302     //  Joe, looks like the DA is getting fuckin' greedy again. Sonnavabitch turned down this month's payoff, has the balls to say it ain't enough. That asshole just bought a new car with our fuckin' money and this is what I get. I want you to find the little shit's ride and leave a message under the hood. Harry'll set you up. Just remember Joe, I want him scared, not dead. And I want it done now!
31_56_60_0303     //  Just got my hands on a big score of guns I gotta move on, and I could use another guy.  Tony's been right about you so far, so I'm thinkin' of cuttin' you in.  There's a delivery of guns waitin' in Riverside that I need you to taker care of fast.  You get the goods, then sell 'em quick to the local dealers.  Don't fuck this up, and there'll be a nice cut in it for ya'.
31_56_60_0304     //  Joe, some fuck just hit one of our armored trucks before we got a chance to unload the guns.  Had to be an inside job.  I don't need this bullshit right now.  I don't care what you do or who you gotta kill, but you get our guns back, now!
31_56_60_0401     //  Joe, thank God you are here. Three of my best customers pulled a big job that went bad. I just found out the cops are looking for them and I worry they will catch them soon. It is very risky for me to be on the street right now. Can you warn them? Joe, I've known these customers for years. They are like family. Do this as a favor for me, please.
31_56_60_0402     //  Joe, I cannot thank you enough. My friends and I... we owe you. But there is still a small problem. My friends, they borrowed a car from Charlie for their job. The car needs to get back to Charlie but not if the cops are looking for it. Can you help me on this? I will make it worth your time.
31_56_60_0403     //  Joe, a customer came in today and offered me a good deal on his car. Cars are usually not my thing, but this deal is too good to pass and the guy desperately needs the cash. Can you take the car to Charlie and sell it? You know cars better than I do and I trust you will get us a fair deal. Of course, you will get a good cut from the profits. Be careful, Joe. There's something... funny about this guy. He was anxious to give me the car.
31_56_60_0404     //  I knew that bastard was not to be trusted. I find out from a friend where that sonnavabitch is hiding. I need somebody to take care of him for me. But, Joe, I not want anybody to get killed over this. I want you to, um, frame him for me. You get his car and make sure the cops are after him. Then return it to him before he catches on. With cops after him, he will have no time to come after me.
31_56_60_0501     //  Joe, I hear you're lookin' to pick up some extra cash. I got an easy job for ya'. Lent some friends of mine a few cars to pull off a job a while back. Damn things been sittin' in South Millville a while now and I think I can finally move 'em. Bring em' back to me and I'll make it worth it for ya. One thing though. From what I hear, the job got a little messy. The kind of mess that don't come out with a hose. You wanna get paid you clean 'em up first. Last time the stench was so bad my girl wouldn't touch me for a week.
31_56_60_0502     //  Joe, I hear you're lookin' to pick up some extra cash. I got an easy job for ya'. Built a sweet ride for a guy who thinks he's a racer. Problem is the little bastard don't believe the car's as good as I say. From what I see, you ain't so bad behind the wheel. You take the car for a little ride, show him what my baby's made of, and I know he'll bite. I get paid, you get paid.
31_56_60_0503     //  Got a little situation here Joe. Did a little extra body work on a car as a special order. Rigged the brakes so they would give out after a few days. Problem is some dumb grease monkey here gave the car to the wrong guy. But there's some folks we know that ain't gonna be happy if that car ain't here when they need it. I need you to get it back. If you're lucky, the brakes will still work fine. But hey, way you drive, it's not like you use the things anyway.
31_56_60_0504     //  Joe! Some fucks broke in here last night and ran off with a roadster. Had to be that prick greaser I just shit-canned. I've seen what those fuckers do with these things, Joe. When they're done racin' it, car won't even be good for parts. That car ain't mine Joe. Belongs to someone with a lot more juice than me and you. You get it back for me in one piece and I'll take care of you big time. But Joe, I ain't lookin' for a bloodbath here, I just want my car back. Try not to kill someone for a change then.
31_56_60_0601     //  Okay Barbaro, let's see if you're as good as they say. We got some two-bit bookie thinks he can run a side racket under our nose and not pay us our cut. Last mistake he'll ever make. I need you to find this fuck and send a message to the rest of our guys. You find him, you kill him, then you take out his entire crew! Pull this off, come back and see me. Don't, and you'll be prayin' for Luca's gentle touch when I'm through with you.
31_56_60_0602     //  Alright Joe, got somethin for ya' that's a little more...delicate. Got word one of our guys' is lookin' to get himself promoted. Sonnavabitch is ready to make a move on Falcone. I need this asshole dead, today. Guy is well liked, don't think anyone, even Falcone will believe it. You take him out, but you make sure it don't get back to anyone, especially me. I got somethin' special for ya' to pull off the job. And Joe, you better not fucking miss.
31_56_60_0603     //  Barbaro, looks like this shit's thicker than I thought. It's gettin' to where I don't know who I can trust. We got this guy workin' with an outside crew, and this asshole's been skimmin' from us for months...enough to buy himself a death sentence. The prick has a run with his guys today. Steal a cab, play nice for a while, take him to his meet, then gut them all! Sonnavabitch has never seen you before, so it shouldn't be a problem. See me when you're through.
31_56_60_0604     //  Alright Joe, you done good. Looks like Balls and Eddie got it right for a change. Got a van I need picked up in the Uptown parkin' lot. This thing's got some important cargo Falcone wants delivered to him now. I need someone solid on this who ain't gonna fuck up. Guess that's you. Get the van and bring it back, but make sure you don't draw any heat on us. When you're through, see me about havin' that talk with Gurino for ya'.
31_56_60_0701     //  Joe, I'm in big fuckin' trouble here! I hit some guy - I mean some crazy fuck just jumped in front of my cab this morning! He came outta nowhere, he had to be like drunk or somethin'! The fucker's dead Joe! The cops'll never believe it was an accident! You gotta help me! I didn't think nobody was lookin' so I shoved his body in my trunk. You gotta do somethin' with it fast!
31_56_60_0702     //  Shit Joe, that was close! But I ain't through it yet. See that cab we trashed, it ain't mine. What am I supposed to tell my boss,  I gotta go back to work today! We gotta get a new cab so he don't know the truth. Thing is, my boss is a real asshole. He knows those cars better than he does his kids. We gotta make sure it's a perfect match, down to the plates. Come on Joe, I'm screwed without you!
31_56_60_0703     //  Thanks Joe I owe you. And I got the perfect way to pay ya' back. I got some, you know, working girls I get paid to drive around at night. It's easy work and the pays good. Plus there's the girls. I'm still shaked up today from all that business before. You know how my stomach gets when I'm like that. I can't put the girls through this. Trust me Joe, it'll be a good time. What do ya say?
31_56_60_0704     //  Joe! I'm in deep shit here! Went back to work this morning, and this hotrod just comes right at me! I didn't get hurt or nothin', but these guys show up outta nowhere and want me to pay for it! I told those fucks, next time they better watch where they park their ride. Next thing I know, they're shootin' at me! I ran down some subway station over near Kingston. These assholes are gettin' closer Joe, and they're gonna find me! I don't want to die down here!
31_56_60_0801     //  What a perfect fuckin' day. Vito's just got picked up by the cops, some rat bastard just made a deal to send me, Henry, and Luca with him, and I'm freezin' my fuckin' balls off. I've gotta find this sonnavabitch and deal with him so we can all go home.
31_56_60_0802     //  Tony got word from Derek that some fuckers are tryin' to move some heavy shit through the docks without coughin' up their share. This ain't the usual stuff, we're talkin' army grade shit here, enough to make a fortune on the street. Tony pulled some favors, looks like it's me and him on this job. We gotta take 'em for all they got. I pull this off, could be the break I need to get back inside.
31_56_60_0803     //  Eddie got a line on some big money coming out of one of those, what the fuck are they called again... supermarkets. You know, the big deli's the girls hang out in. These girls musta spent a shitload there 'cause he said there's gonna be a big cash transfer, biggest he's seen all year. Tony and me gotta get down there and grab it. I figure this is gotta be easy money. Couple of pissed off broads and screaming kids, how hard can it be?
31_56_60_0804     //  These last couple of jobs have been a real pain in the ass. Somethin' ain't addin' up. I need to get down to the cathouse, have a talk with Rocco and Eddie. Plus I'm dyin' for a drink.
31_56_60_0805     //  I knew there was somethin' fucked up with that Rocco guy from the start. We got him cornered at the Construction Yard. I gotta find this lyin' prick and put an end to this bullshit once and for all. I'm fuckin' itchin' for payback.

310031320         //  n_A... bunch of doctors.
310031330         //  n_Bullshit. They all smoke too. If you could get cancer from smoking, don't you think doctors would be first ones to quit?

310031410         //  n_Why didn't you go with 'em?
310031415         //  n_Eh, too windy. Besides, I can't stand heights.
310031420         //  Hey, get lost!
310031430         //  Get the hell out of here!
310031440         //  Hey, asshole, stop staring at us and get lost.
310031450         //  If you want to clean my boots, go ahead.
310031460         //  You see anything that needs cleaning? No? Then get the fuck out of here!
310031470         //  Get... the fuck... out of here!
310031480         //  Hey, fuck off, will you?
310031490         //  You're really starting to piss me off.
310031500         //  Hey, mind your own business.
310031510         //  The fuck are you staring at?
310031520         //  Something interesting over here?
310031530         //  Yeah?
310031540         //  Yeah? Can I help you?
310031550         //  Don't you got something better to do?
310031560         //  Hey, do yourself a favor and get out of my face, pal.
310031570         //  These two are here to clean up the uh... "mess."
310031580         //  The mess? Oh! That mess...
310031590         //  Alright, come on, you two!
310031600         //  One of the guys, who was uh, here before. He uh... tripped and fell.
310031610         //  The poor guy hit his head pretty hard... About five or six times...
310031620         //  So now there's blood all over the fucking place... And we got a meeting that's supposed to start soon.
310031630         //  So you gotta get this shit cleaned up, and you gotta make it snappy.
310031640         //  Hey, get the fuck over here!
310031650         //  Come on, you moron!
310031660         //  Get over here, now!
310031670         //  Hey, asshole, you're here to clean, not to talk!
310031680         //  Less chit-chat, more clean-up-the-fucking-mess, you got me?!
310031690         //  Stop fucking around and get over here!
310032000         //  Ahh shit, it's closed! The idiot was supposed to leave it open for us!
310032010         //  Now we gotta wait and hope that asshole shows up. Fuck!
310032020         //  Can't we just get in some other way?
310032030         //  You could try, but I'm gonna wait here for a while, just in case numbnuts shows up...that lazy piece of shit!
310032040         //  Alright, here's our ticket inside.
310032050         //  Hey. Everything all set?
310032060         //  Just like you asked for.
310032070         //  Alright, here you go. Now get the hell out of here.
310032080         //  Pleasure doing business with you.
310032081         //  See? I got it all under control. C'mon, let's go pick up our uniforms.
310032090         //  Come on, you idiot...
310032100         //  Where the fuck are you?!
310032110         //  I'm gonna kill this guy, I fucking swear...
310032120         //  Can I help you?
310032130         //  Excuse me, sir, are you lost?
310032140         //  Do you need some directions, sir?
310032150         //  Excuse me, sir, this area is for employees only.
310032160         //  Pardon me, sir, are you a guest at the hotel?

310032180         //  Hey, fella. You uh, need some direction?
310032190         //  Can I help you with something, sir?
310032200         //  Uh, this place is for employees only, pal.
310032210         //  Are you lost, buddy?
310032220         //  You uh, need some directions?
310032230         //  Hey, uh, what are you doing back here?
310032240         //  Hey, who's the new guy?

310032280         //  Sir, do you need any assistance?
310032290         //  Sir! Are you a guest?
310032300         //  I don't think you're supposed to be back here.
310032310         //  Jeez, there he is again!
310032320         //  Sir! Can I help you with something?
310032330         //  You still lost?
310032340         //  Seriously, what are you doing back here?
310032350         //  Hey, what are you doing sneaking around here?
310032360         //  You ain't an employee, are you?
310032370         //  Hey! You can't go in there!
310032380         //  Hey stop! You're not supposed to be back here!
310032390         //  Hey, where do you think you're going?!
310032400         //  Hey, stop!
310032410         //  Hey, pal, what are you doing here?!
310032420         //  Where are you going?! You're not supposed to be here!
310032430         //  Hey, boss, we got a visitor here!
310032440         //  Hey! I asked you a question! Hey, boss!
310032450         //  Boss, there's some guy in here!
310032460         //  Hey, stop right there!
310032470         //  Oh fuck! Stop it!

310032520         //  Ouch! Stopping, please!
310032530         //  C'mon, stop!
310032540         //  Leave me alone, will you?
310032550         //  Fuck this, I'm out of here!
310032560         //  Aww c'mon!
310032561         //  Hey, hey - pipe down if you know what's good for you.
310032562         //  Just mind your business, pal.
310032563         //  Do you get paid enough to care? Then shut your mouth.
310032564         //  Don't worry about it, mind your business.
310032565         //  What are you a schlep or a fucking watchdog?
310032566         //  Don't worry about me. Just go back to doing what you were doing.
310032567         //  Nothing to see here, pal.
310032568         //  Just passing through.
310032620         //  Hmm... Alright.
310032630         //  Pleasure doing business with you.
310032640         //  Alright, just don't let my supervisor see you.
310032650         //  Hey. Why not.
310032660         //  Thanks, pal.
310032670         //  Never saw you.
310032680         //  Gotcha.
310032690         //  Sure.
310032700         //  Your secret's safe with me!
310032710         //  Alrighty then. Thanks.
310032720         //  Excuse me, sir. This area is for hotel employees only. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
310032721         //  Sir, you have to leave, now.  It's for your own safety, sir.
310032722         //  Hey, if you're not gonna leave, I'll just have to help you.
310032730         //  Here, take this and forget you ever seen me.
310032740         //  Is this some kind of joke?
310032750         //  Looks like you're leaving the hard way...
310032760         //  Great...
310032770         //  Sir!
310032780         //  What is this guy, deaf?
310032790         //  That's it, I'll just take care of this myself.
310032800         //  I don't think so, pal!
310032810         //  Yeah!
310032820         //  Beat his ass!
310032830         //  Show him who's the boss around here, boss!
310032840         //  That'll teach him!
310032850         //  We should do this every day!
310032860         //  C'mon, beat his ass!
310032870         //  Yeah!
310032880         //  Way to go!
310032890         //  Finish him off!
310032900         //  Beat him to a pulp.
310032905         //  Well, that was something!
310032910         //  Ehh, let's get back to work.
310032920         //  Now that was entertainment.
310032930         //  Nice job, pal.
310032940         //  Whew! What a day!
310032950         //  Great job! I gotta be getting back to work now.
310032960         //  That was one hell of a fight!
310032970         //  Thanks for the show, pal.
310032980         //  Nice work with the boss, buddy.
310032990         //  Don't worry about me, I ain't seen a thing.
310033000         //  Hey, quit slacking off!
310033010         //  Enough with the damn smoke breaks...
310033020         //  Do it right, or I'll find somebody who will!
310033030         //  Hey. How's it going?
310033040         //  Make it snappy, will you? What the hell's taking so long?
310033050         //  Stop half-assing it!
310033060         //  Hey, keep it up and you'll be looking for a new job!
310033070         //  Who the hell...
310033080         //  Hey, you got no business in here. Go away!
310033090         //  I'll take this if you don't mind.
310033100         //  Like hell I don't! Now you feel the fisting of Ting-Lao!
310033110         //  Look, I'm really sorry I couldn't get here sooner...
310033120         //  Another minute and you would've been late to your own damn funeral.
310033130         //  Sorry, I was -
310033140         //  Alright, enough. Just get the hell out of here.
310033150         //  Vito! About time. Where the hell you been?
310033160         //  Never mind.
310033170         //  Hey, where the fuck are you going?!
310033180         //  Get back here, Vito!
310033190         //  Stop screwing around!
310033191         //  Here, pick one and put it on.
310033200         //  OK, let's go.
310033210         //  Hey, you two! Get over here!
310033220         //  You got shit in your ears or what?! Get over here I said!
310033230         //  Let's go, assholes!
310033240         //  Clean this shit up, will you?
310033250         //  Somebody's gonna slip and break their neck.
310033260         //  Clean up this fucking mess, you idiots.
310033270         //  C'mon, we don't want to blow our cover.
310033340         //  C'mon, what's taking so long?
310033350         //  You's are slower than molasses, you know that?
310033440         //  That was fucking Henry!
310033450         //  Yeah...
310033460         //  Alright, c'mon, let's get up there before he gets back.
310033470         //  Haven't seen Henry in a while...
310033480         //  Hasn't changed a bit.
310033490         //  Haha, yeah. I hope he don't come back before we do our thing. Henry's good people, even if he does work for Clemente.
310033500         //  Yeah... but what if he does?
310033510         //  Don't even think about that...
310033520         //  I feel like an idiot with this thing on my lip.
310033530         //  Yeah? Well, what if we run into somebody we know? This way, they won't recognize us.
310033540         //  Fucking hope so.
310033550         //  Hehehe... you look just like your old man.
310033560         //  That's funny, 'cause you look like your mother.
310033570         //  Fuck you, wiseguy.
310033580         //  I better stick with Joe. He's the one with the bomb.
310033650         //  Be careful, there might be more of them.
310033670         //  Here they come!
310033680         //  See you next fall, asshole.
310033690         //  Whoa, easy - that's top-shelf hooch!
310033700         //  All this good booze... going to waste!
310033710         //  I see you with a bottle in your hand, I shoot you myself!
310033750         //  Come on, Vito! We ain't got time!
310033760         //  Let's go!  Follow me.
310040380         //  In case you were wondering, the elevator don't go to the roof. That's why we're taking the stairs.
310040390         //  Damn, I ain't used to this much exercise. Why do they gotta put so many fucking stairs...
310040420         //  n_Hey, beautiful. You got any Italian in you?
310040430         //  n_Ahhh...yes.
310040440         //  n_Well, uh, would you like some more?
310040450         //  n_Ugh...
310040460         //  n_Was that a "yes?"
310040470         //  n_Agh... Please, go away...
310040480         //  n_Alright, I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
310040490         //  n_You're darn right it was.
310040500         //  n_Let me make it up to you.
310040510         //  n_I don't think so...
310040520         //  n_I insist... I feel terrible.
310040530         //  n_No.
310040540         //  n_It'll be the most romantic night of your life, I swear.
310040550         //  n_I seriously doubt that, Romeo.
310040560         //  n_Come on, we'll grab some pizza, then we can play a little back seat bingo.
310040570         //  n_Ugh!
310040580         //  n_What's the matter, you don't like pizza?
310040590         //  n_You have serious problems, you know that? Acting this way with a woman you don't even know!
310040600         //  n_Ahh, you're right. So uh, what's your name, dollface?
310040610         //  n_Christina. Christina Clemente.
310040620         //  n_Cle... Clemente?
310040630         //  n_Mmmhmmm.
310040640         //  n_As in... Alberto... Clemente?
310040650         //  n_Oh, you know my Uncle Al?
310040660         //  n_Uh, no, no, not really...
310040670         //  n_I'm sorry, what did you say your name was again?
310040680         //  n_Uh... um, oh shit, look at the time! I-I-I really gotta get going now. Nice meeting you.
310040690         //  n_Hmmhmmhmm, works every time...
310040790         //  n_Hey, get lost.
310040800         //  n_Can't you see that me and the lady are having a conversation? Beat it!
310040810         //  n_This is a private conversation, so get lost.
310040820         //  Mmm... I like a man in uniform, just not that uniform.
310040830         //  Sorry, honey, you're just not my type.
310040840         //  Ever get the feeling you're not in control of your own destiny?
310040844         //  Hey, baby. How are you?
310040846         //  He-llo there...
310040850         //  n_You know what this is all about?
310040860         //  n_Yeah.
310040870         //  n_Well - you gonna tell me?
310040880         //  n_You heard about how somebody turned Luca into chop meat, right?
310040885         //  n_Yeah. I heard it was Tony uh...
310040890         //  n_Tony Balls. One of the Falcone guys.
310040900         //  n_Naa, I heard it was... Tony uh, Stugots.
310040910         //  n_Yeah, that's him.
310040920         //  n_...What do you mean, "that's him"?
310040930         //  n_Tony Balls, Tony Stugots... It's the same guy.
310040940         //  n_...You sure?
310040950         //  n_Yeah yeah yeah, same guy.
310040960         //  n_Why the hell's he got two names?
310040970         //  n_What's wrong with having two names? A lot of guys got two names. Some guys got three or four names.
310040980         //  n_It's confusing.
310040990         //  n_Yeah, says you. You're just jealous 'cause you only got one.
310041000         //  n_Hey, one's all I need, alright?
310041010         //  n_Well uh, you might want to consider getting another one.
310041020         //  n_What for?
310041030         //  n_Cause the one you got, uh... Well, it ain't the best.

310041220         //  n_Look, since I got here, I had two fellas tell me your were all in "construction," one fella told me it was "sanitation," and another one told me you were all "in the union." I'm dying to hear your version of the story.

310041970         //  Hurry the fuck up, or there's gonna be another stain on the floor.
310041980         //  Stop half-assing it and let's go.
310041990         //  OK, that's clean enough. Now get the fuck out of here.
310042000         //  No can do, we're not done yet.
310042010         //  Can't leave yet.
310042020         //  OK, now let's get to the roof.
310042030         //  Come on, let's go! We gotta find the stairs.
310042040         //  We ain't got much time! Let's go to roof.
310042050         //  Vito, come on. Let's find the stairs.
310042060         //  Whoa whoa whoa, what about the bucket? You can't leave this shit here. Take it with you.
310042070         //  Excuse me, where are the stairs?
310042080         //  Hey, uh, could you tell me where the stairs are?
310042090         //  Sorry to bother you, but, do you know where I can find the stairs?
310042100         //  Fuck off.
310042110         //  How the fuck should I know?
310042120         //  Go bother somebody else.
310042130         //  You're the one who works here, right?
310042140         //  I got your stairs, right here.
310042141         //  n_Guy walks into a bar sees a little guy playing a piano, right. Guy's like a foot tall, playing the shit out of the piano, right? Guy asks the bartender - 'Where did you find this guy? This is amazing!' Bartender says 'Oh, my magic coin. Grants you one wish. Anything you want. Guy says 'Really?' Bartender says 'Yeah, don't work so good, though.' Guy says 'Why not?' Bartender says 'You really think I asked for a 12 inch pianist?'
310042142         //  n_Its good! I'm pissing my pants over here!
310042143         //  n_Hahaha. Hehehe. Yeah, hehe.
310042144         //  n_Get it? Pianist, like a cazzone!
310042145         //  n_Hahaha. Hey, come on, boss. Tell us another one.
310042150         //  Hey, Vito. Over here.
310042151         //  n_Haha, hey, boss- you should have been a comedian!
310042152         //  n_Alright alright one more, one more, that's it.
310042154         //  That's Clemente! We could take him out right now! If we had a gun...
310042155         //  Yeah, and we'd be dead in two seconds. Just take it easy and stick to the plan.
310042160         //  Finally. We're almost done.
310042161         //  n_Alright, a guy's walking down the street, right? Bumps into this whore... She says, Hey sweetheart, I'll do anything you need, anything you want, anything you could think of - for twenty dollars. But you can only use three words to describe what you want. Oh, wait, three words, all right, so he's thinking. He says, I've got it. She says, OK, baby, what do you want? I'm getting all hot and bothered. He gives her the twenty dollars and says, hey, paint my house. Heee, hahaha... For twenty dollars, right? That's a bargain. I don't care who you are...
310042162         //  n_Hey, I got another, I got another. What do you call a...? OK, I got another. What do you say to a broad who's got two black eyes? Nothing - you already told here twice. Hahahaha...
310042170         //  The roof is the other way.
310042180         //  Can't turn back now.
310042190         //  Uh, the roof is usually up, not down.
310042200         //  There's no reason to go down there.
310042210         //  These stairs... are gonna.. kill me...
310042220         //  Wait... Wait a minute... fucking stairs...
310042230         //  Come on, let's go! Aren't you the one who's always hurrying me up?
310042240         //  What, do you want me to carry you?
310042250         //  Guns, bombs, bad guys - no problem. Staircase? Sorry, can't do it.
310042255         //  Fuck you... Alright, come on....
310050001         //  Hey, what the fuck are you doing here? Get lost!
310050002         //  I told you, get lost! You can clean up here later.
310050003         //  Shit! They got guns!
310050004         //  Kill 'em!
310050005         //  Come on Vito, showtime.
310050006         //  We can take 'em out from here. Come on, we don't got much time!
310050010         //  Hey, what the fuck is going on up here? It sounded like gunsho - oh shit!
310050240         //  Oh shit!
310050250         //  OK, Vito, here we go!
310050260         //  Shit! Kill 'em!
310050270         //  OK... That takes care of that.
310050280         //  I hope nobody heard us up here.
310050290         //  Na, buildings like this got soundproof windows. And we're so high up, nobody on the street could've heard us neither. C'mon, let's get to the window washing platform.
310050300         //  Alright, Vito, we gotta move. Let's find that platform.
310050310         //  Hold your horses, I'm coming...
310050320         //  Be careful, we might run into more of these assholes...
310050330         //  Gee, I wonder why... We only made enough noise to wake the dead.
310050340         //  Heads up, here they come!
310050400         //  Looks like there's somebody on it already. Let's get it up here.
310050410         //  Come on, pull it up.
310050440         //  Here's some tape, tie him up.
310050450         //  What the hell are you two doing? I wasn't done with my - oh shit...
310050460         //  Sorry, pal, but we got a job to do. If you play ball, you'll be fine. Now get down on the ground.
310050470         //  Jesus, OK... OK, don't shoot! I'll do whatever you say!
310050480         //  Alright, put your hands behind your back. We ain't gonna hurt you.
310050481         //  Was that really necessary?
310050490         //  You should consider yourself lucky. Everybody else got shot.
310050500         //  Goddamnit, come on! What the hell are you waiting for?
310050510         //  What the hell's up with you? I'll just do it my damn self.
310050520         //  I thought you said he was just doing his job, Mr. Hyde.
310050530         //  OK, get on. We got work to do.
310050600         //  OK, this is the right floor.
310050610         //  Vito, grab the squeegee and start washing windows so we don't look suspicious. I gotta connect the wires.
310050620         //  Vito! C'mon!
310050630         //  What the fuck are you waiting for?
310050640         //  What the fuck are you doing?
310050650         //  Hey, what the hell are you staring at! Get back to work!
310050660         //  This ain't no fucking peep show! Get back to work!
310050670         //  Hey, retard! Start working or get the fuck out of here!
310050690         //  Shit, Vito, he's looking right at us! Start cleaning the window! Are you stupid or what?! They'll recognize us!
310050950         //  Ah shit, there's more of them!
310050970         //  OK! Now, push the button, Vito.
310051000         //  Hey... how much wire you got?
310051010         //  Enough.
310051020         //  How much is "enough"? Will it reach up to the roof?
310051030         //  Of course not! We'll just  go up one or two floors and blow it.
310051040         //  So much for you being the smart one.
310051050         //  What?
310051060         //  This is crazy. What if the explosion takes us out too?
310051070         //  It won't. We'll barely feel it.
310051080         //  We better not. If we fall off of this thing, you're gonna be dead before we hit the ground.
310051110         //  Just flap your arms, like you're always flapping your lips, and you'll be fine.
310051120         //  Why am I friends with you again?
310051150         //  Whoa! Look at that!

310051210         //  You... You assholes... I'll get you's...
310051220         //  Nooo! I didn't do anything... No!
310051230         //  Must've watered down his martini.
310051234         //  Alright, Vito, you get the left side! I'll take the right.
310051235         //  One, two, three!

310051270         //  Fuck!
310051280         //  Ah, shit! This way, Vito, you won't get through there!
310051290         //  Shit! Too hot!
310051300         //  Ahh, fuck! The sprinklers are going off.
310051310         //  Really? 'Cause I thought it was raining...
310051320         //  Wiseass. I can't see a damn thing through all this water!
310051325         //  Fuck! There's more of them coming!
310051326         //  Come on, assholes, I'm waiting for ya....

310051330         //  Hey, what the heck's going on here?
310051350         //  Get out of there, lady. We ain't got nothing against you.

310051430         //  Hey, how the fuck was I supposed to know Clemente would be in the bathroom?
310051440         //  He wouldn't have been if the bomb didn't go off early.
310051450         //  Don't worry, we'll get him.
310060180         //  No. No! You fucking assholes! No, you're not getting away so easy! Uh-uh! I know you're there, I know you're there! Come on, come on out! Come on, peek your little fucking head out there, I'll blow it off, you bastards!

310070330         //  Alright, there's two of 'em. If they split up, make sure you follow Clemente, not the other guy.
310070340         //  I know how to drive, alright? Just be ready with the gun!
310070350         //  Don't worry about that. Just follow Clemente. He's in the black limo!

310070430         //  Nice job.
310070440         //  Clemente's next!
310070450         //  Shit, this things's gonna blow!
310070460         //  Be careful, Vito!!!
310070470         //  I can't get any closer, Joe. Kill him already!
310070480         //  I'm fucking trying!
310070490         //  Try shooting out his tires!
310070500         //  Fuck that, I'm aiming for his fucking head!
310070600         //  Shit, we're almost at Clemente's fucking compound. We gotta get him NOW, Vito!
310080010         //  Ahh shit, what a day. I should go home now.
310510010         //  Hello.
310510020         //  Yeah, uh, i-is this uh, Vito?
310510030         //  Who's asking?
310510040         //  Name's Leon. I'm the bartender at the Lone Star. I'm ringing you 'cause Joe Barbaro gave me your number. Says he's a friend of yours?
310510050         //  Yeah, what about him?
310510060         //  Well, old Joe been guzzling my top-shelf hooch all night long, dribblin' on about some cat named Marty, and now he done just gone plain salty on me.
310510061         //  What the hell are you talking about?
310510062         //  Your friend is out of control, man! He all waving his gun around and shit, and we can't talk no sense to him.
310510063         //  Great...
310510064         //  Now look, I ain't looking for no trouble with you fellas. Could you please come pick his drunk ass up before he shoots somebody, or somebody calls the police?
310510100         //  Vito, you gots to come on down here and pick his ass up! You comin' or not?
310510110         //  Hey, Joe's a big boy. He can take care of himself. Just make a list of what he breaks, and we'll settle it up tomorrow.
310510120         //  I ain't worried about that, but if the man shows up, they'll close this joint down for at least a week.
310510130         //  Hey, that's your problem right now, not mine. Look, just go find him a couple of hookers or something. That... that usually calms him down. Good luck.
310510140         //  Alright, I'll be right there. And hey! Don't give him any more booze 'til I get there.
310510150         //  I'm a try, but your friend, he ain't gonna be down with that, you dig?
310510170         //  Hey - if you don't cut him off right now, I'm gonna cut you off when I get there, got it?
310510180         //  Alright man, alright. Just hurry!
310510250         //  Alright, how many people are in the bar right now?
310510260         //  Just me now. Joint was jumping about an hour ago, but now everybody done gone and split!
310510270         //  Alright, listen - lock the place up 'til I get there. I'll be there in a minute.
310510280         //  OK, gotcha.
310510455         //  Uh oh... What the fuck did you do, Vito? You're always getting me into trouble.
310510460         //  Just... shut up, huh?
310510470         //  Vito, get rid of the cops! You can't let me out with the cops on our ass!
310510500         //  Sorry, Leon...
310510505         //  One of these days, Joe is gonna drive me nuts.
310990001         //  When you're dealing with wiseguys, everybody always wants a favor. You don't like what they gotta say though, you can always say no. But when the boss asks you to do him a favor, he's not asking. (phone rings in Vito's new house)
311010000         //  Who the hell is that?
311010001         //  Holy shit...
311010004         //  Well, I guess you know Clemente's dead, along with everybody else. Listen, Vito, I know Falcone had something to do with this. And, I'm worried that he's gonna wanna take out what's left of the family.
311010006         //  And I should care about this why?
311010007         //  Well, yeah... Look, about you going away... I'm sorry for what Clemente did to you... But he got what was coming to him, right? I don't give a rat's ass about that old bastard. Matter of fact, I'd work for Falcone just the same...
311010008         //  You're saying you want to join up with us?
311010009         //  Yeah, and since you work for him I thought uh, maybe... You think you could put in a good word for me?
311010013         //  Yeah, sure. Me and Joe can vouch for you.
311010014         //  Uh, come to the Maltese Falcon in a little while. We'll talk to Eddie first.
311010015         //  Thanks, Vito. I owe you one.
311010020         //  Hey, Vito, long time no see.
311010030         //  Sure. Long time. What do you want, Henry?
311010040         //  A drink. Let's take my car.
311020010         //  Too late, Henry's already in there.
311030010         //  Hey, where you going!  There's two fellas waiting for us out there.
311030011         //  Come on, Vito. You said we don't have much time...
311030012         //  Now what?
311030013         //  Got any bright ideas? I sure the hell don't.
311030014         //  I still say we should shoot the bastards...
311030015         //  Eh, this was shaping up to be a nice day too...
311030016         //  This is for the birds, Vito. If you don't want to shoot 'em, let's just get out of here.
311030017         //  Here. Get under the bed.
311030018         //  Leo, get under the bed.
311030019         //  Hey... We could hide under the bed!
311030020         //  Hmm, maybe we can fit in here!
311030021         //  Hey, maybe we can hide in the shower.
311030022         //  The window! Maybe we can jump down.
311030023         //  You gone nuts?
311030024         //  That ain't the brightest idea I ever heard, kid...
311030025         //  No way I'm jumping. At my age I'd rather take a bullet than fall and break my damn hip.
311030040         //  Here, Leo. Get in.
311030050         //  In here, Leo! And lock the door.
311030060         //  The sheets!
311030070         //  Shit, can't go this way. We'll end up right in front of Henry's goons.
311030090         //  We could get down to the backyard this way. Just need a rope or something.
311030100         //  Leo, give me some help here, I got a plan.
311030200         //  Vito!? What the hell are you doing here?!
311030210         //  All right, take it easy, Henry. Put the gun down and send the guys away. I'm gonna explain everything.
311030220         //  Boys! Wait for me outside!
311030230         //  If I don't come out in a few minutes, come looking for me.
311030240         //  Get in there.
311030300         //  How the hell we gonna get out of here?
311030310         //  Through the back door downstairs. Or we could hide up here somewhere.
311030320         //  Come on then, let's go.
311030330         //  This room won't work.
311030340         //  No place to hide in here.
311030350         //  Maybe in the bedroom?
311030360         //  We could try the game room?
311030370         //  Go get some sheets from the laundry.
311030380         //  Lets go out through the kitchen.
311040675         //  You ever get the feeling you'd be better off in a different line of work?
311040676         //  Yeah... And I guess it pays a hell of a lot better than being a fucking taxi driver.
311040677         //  So I was your last resort, huh? Thanks. Hey, not for nothing, how come you come to see me and not Joe?
311040678         //  Yeah... can't argue with you there.
311041310         //  To be honest with you, not really.
311041320         //  This is what I am. What I'm good at.
311041340         //  I was thinking about skipping town after that business at the hotel, but where am I gonna go? What am I gonna do?
311041350         //  That's why I came to see you.
311041370         //  Look, uh... Joe's solid. But I wouldn't exactly want him speaking on my behalf. You know what I mean?
311041601         //  So uh, how's life?
311041602         //  Got no idea what you're talking about...
311041603         //  Buddy of Joe's? Who you talking about?
311041604         //  You mean Marty?
311041605         //  Yeah yeah, I heard about that...
311041606         //  Let's put it this way - me and Joe were out taking care of something for our boss that day. That's all I'm gonna say.
311041607         //  Yeah, sure.
311041608         //  You know what, can we please not talk about this right now? Or ever again.
311041620         //  You mean before or after half the guys I know got killed?
311041700         //  You uh, gonna tell Frank what happened?
311041701         //  Well, first, let's get out of here before your friend changes his mind.
311041730         //  Sure I am, but don't worry I ain't gonna mention your name. You're going to have enough to worry about as it is.
311041740         //  Thanks, Leo. You know this whole thing got - complicated - real fast. You know?
311041750         //  Of course, it did Vito... What'd you expect? You swear the oath, you put on a fancy suit, and then it's one big party?
311041760         //  Carlo's always been a shady bastard, even for guys in this business. I've been warning Frank about him for years.
311041770         //  So what are you gonna do now?
311041780         //  I'm gonna disappear, let things run their course. Gonna take the first train to Lost Heaven. Make a few phone calls, settle my affairs. Then I'm gonna head for the airport and I'm gonna go someplace warm. This time tomorrow I'm gonna be sitting on a beach somewhere sipping one of them fruity drinks with the umbrella in 'em.
311041790         //  One thing's for sure. If Carlo wants me dead, then sticking around here is like buying a one-way ticket to the morgue.
311041800         //  Isn't that a little drastic?
311041810         //  No, I been meaning to retire anyway. When you get to be my age, Vito, then all this squabbling starts to seem a little pointless. Frank's never going to change, he's a brawler. Nowadays he just listens to the young hotheads because they tell him what he wants to hear. If he wants to be some kind of wiseguy sheriff and go after Carlo then he can do it without me. I'm just sorry I got you into this mess.
311041820         //  It was my choice, Leo. All you did was speed things up a little. Besides, what the hell else was I gonna do? Go work on the docks like my old man?
311041830         //  Eh, you're preachin' to the choir, kid...
311041860         //  You got it, old man.
311041861         //  OK, Vito, now get me over to the train station if you wouldn't mind. This town's been good to me, but now it's time to say goodbye.
311041862         //  So what are your plans, Vito? Looks like you're in it up to your neck right now.
311041863         //  I don't really got any. I guess I just want to make a shitload of dough and not get my head blown off in the process
311041864         //  Ah, real original. That ain't as easy as it sounds, kid. Trust me on that.
311041865         //  Alright, here it is. Thanks for everything, Vito. Just promise me that you're never going to be as stupid as you were today. Risking your neck like this just to buy an old man a few more years.
311041890         //  Enjoy your vacation, old man.
311042020         //  That business at the hotel, you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
311042040         //  That's funny, 'cause a buddy of Joe's got popped in the parking lot that day, so I just figured you two were in on it...
311042060         //  You know that fuckin' kid used to come into Freddy's with Joe all the time - what's his name, uh, Mikey, uh, Micky... Whatever the fuck his name was...
311042080         //  Yeah yeah, that's the kid. Kid has a voice like fucking Minnie Mouse.
311042100         //  So you're sure you weren't there that day. You're positive...
311042120         //  You know what? It don't matter anyway. But do me a favor, would you?
311042140         //  Next time get a better disguise than a phony fucking moustache. I saw you two pricks from a mile away....
311042160         //  Don't worry about it...  You did what you had to do.
311042200         //  You gonna go there in your PJ's?
311042201         //  Damn right I am. I'd rather be alive in my pajamas than dead in a three-piece suit.
311060010         //  Hey, what can I do for you, pal?
311060020         //  Hey. I'm looking for Eric.
311060030         //  Eric's in the kitchen. But he's a little busy right now. Get my drift?
311060040         //  Where's Eric?
311060050         //  Try the kitchen, man.
311060060         //  Are you blind? He's doing the chick by the fridge, man!
311060070         //  You messing with me or what?
311060072         //  n_
311060074         //  n_
311060076         //  n_
311060080         //  Oh, fuck Eric! Have a hit, man.
311060090         //  Eric's in the kitchen, hun... But I think he's busy now...
311060092         //  n_
311060094         //  n_
311060095         //  n_
311060096         //  n_
311060100         //  Eric? Eric who? Why is your hair blue?
311060110         //  Who? Hey, you want some of this? It's good shit, man!
311060120         //  He's in the kitchen right now. But I have a feeling they'll be heading to the bedroom soon.
311060130         //  I haven't straightened out my brother-in-law yet.
311060140         //  Hey, man, move!  We can't see the TV!
311060160         //  Come on, move it!
311060180         //  Because he's an idiot! Get the hell away from the TV, jerkoff!
311060290         //  Eric.
311060300         //  Eric!
311060310         //  What the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm busy here, OK? Get lost.
311060320         //  I think you should be "busy" taking care of your wife, asshole!
311060350         //  Well well well, looks like the little jailbird turned into a fucking preacher.
311060370         //  I'll teach you to hit a woman!
311060380         //  C'mon, you fucking pussy! I'll kill you, you bastard!
311060390         //  What the fuck are you doing here anyway? C'mon!
311060400         //  C'mon, you fucking jailbird. I'm gonna kick the crap out of you.
311060410         //  Wow, look man. A fight!
311060412         //  Fucking pig. How does it feel?!
311060414         //  You like that, you fuck? Huh? Answer me?
311060416         //  Hah! What's the matter? Can't talk?
311060418         //  I'm gonna make you cry like a little girl, you piece of shit!
311060600         //  Hey, I'm looking for Eric Riley? You seen him?
311060620         //  And where would I find this party?
311060640         //  Thank you very much.
311070010         //  Vito, it's Francesca. Eric came home and he's all beat up.  You said you wouldn't hurt him!
311070020         //  He probably got in a fight. You know, he's been hanging out with a very bad crowd.
311070030         //  He apologized for everything, Vito.
311070040         //  He promised he'll be good to me. It's all OK now. So, you'll leave him alone, won't ya?
311070050         //  Hey, whatever you want. But if he hurts you again, I'll kill him.
311070061         //  Listen to yourself, Vito! I-I-I don't know you anymore. Look, you, you stay away from us, you understand? Just, just... Stay away!
311070070         //  No problem. Hey, you take care of yourself, Franny.
311500180         //  What the hell was that?
311500190         //  We were supposed to do this quietly, you idiot!
311500200         //  Fuck that! Let's just kill this fucker and go home.
311500210         //  Aw, shit.
311500220         //  He's in here, lads!
311500230         //  Now we got you, you cunt!
311500270         //  My house! Fuck!
311500271         //  Ah, everything I fucking own...
311500272         //  Shit, can't go this way.
311500280         //  C'mon, Joe! Don't tell me you're not home.
311500290         //  Let's go! You better not be passed out. C'mon!
311500300         //  Hold your horses, I'm coming, I'm coming...
311500310         //  What, were you barbecuing in your underwears?
311500320         //  Yeah. Can I come in?
311500330         //  Oh! Yeah, yeah, of course. I'll fix you a drink.
311500331         //  What the fuck...
311500332         //  Nice, ain't it?
311500333         //  What the hell happened to this place?
311500334         //  I spruced the joint up a little. What do you think?
311500335         //  Yeah, it's really uh... Different.
311500336         //  Yeah, huh? I decorated it myself!
311500337         //  What the hell are these things?
311500338         //  Flamingos. They're from down south. We got pigeons, they got Flamingos. The broads go nuts for them.
311500339         //  If you say so...
311500340         //  So what the hell happened? Here, take this.
311500341         //  Wow, kitchen's pink too...
311500342         //  Now THIS place deserves to be burnt down.
311500343         //  Ah, the bed's not too bad.
311500344         //  Although with the broads he hangs out with, I better not get too close to it.
311500350         //  Those crazy fucking micks.
311500360         //  What about 'em? What did they do??
311500370         //  They tried to fucking kill me!
311500380         //  What?!
311500390         //  And they burned my fucking house down.
311500410         //  Son of a bitch...
311500420         //  So what are you gonna do? You want to go deal with the micks right now?
311510010         //  Damn right I do.
311510020         //  Alright. Relax, have a drink, let me make a few phone calls.
311510021         //  Alright, let's get moving. Them micks all hang out at the Hill O Tara - you know the place? It's that shithole over in Kingston.
311510030         //  And uh, take a look in my closet. Unless you want to go on a rampage in your skivvies.
311510031         //  Oh, great. A fucking clown suit. Can today get any worse?
311510032         //  Hey, you finally got some style. I'm gonna want that shirt back by the way, they don't make threads like those no more.
311510033         //  Yeah, there's a reason for that, you know.
311510040         //  Thanks. Thought you'd never ask.
311510041         //  Hey. It's Joe.
311510042         //  Yeah, I know, I know. But I need a favor.
311510043         //  A bunch of micks tried to kill a good friend of mine tonight. Burned his house down. I wanna know who they are and where they're operating out of.
311510044         //  Hey. You're gonna have a lot worse to worry about if you don't tell me.
311510045         //  Mickey Desmond...
311510046         //  Oh, oh, he is.  Well, that explains it. Where is he now?
311510047         //  Yeah, yeah, I know the place. Alright, thanks.
311510048         //  Don't worry, they won't. Trust me. And hey - you never got this phone call, a capiche?
311510049         //  What does what mean?
311510050         //  Alright, Vito. C'mon, get up, we gotta move.
311510051         //  A capiche... It means "do you understand".
311510052         //  So, do you understand?
311510053         //  Alright. Thanks again, I'll see you.
311510060         //  Where we going?
311510070         //  The Hill of Tara, the mick joint in Kingston. C'mon, I'll tell you the rest in the car.
311510080         //  C'mon, get in.
311510090         //  Alright... so you heard anything about the micks lately?
311510091         //  Na, nothing. Why?
311510100         //  The micks got themselves a new boss, name's Mickey Desmond.
311510110         //  There's a few other guys who want to take his spot, so he's trying to show everybody that he means business.
311510120         //  What the hell does that have to do with me?
311510130         //  Brian O'Neill. He was Desmond's cousin.
311510140         //  Ahh, should've known.
311510150         //  Yeah, for a bunch of fucking morons this donkey sure do got a long memory. And I heard this Desmond guy has got a real chip on his shoulder.
311510160         //  My money's on him being down at that shithole joint right now, laughing it up with the rest of those fuckin' yo-yos.
311510170         //  So, let's get over there and deal with him.
311510180         //  That's the plan. Sounds like there ain't many of 'em left, so I guess we should just storm the place. Surprise the shit out of 'em.
311510190         //  I like this plan. Assholes... Burnt my fucking house down...
311510200         //  Relax, we'll be there in a minute.
311510201         //  Shit, you're gonna need a piece. I almost forgot.
311510202         //  Yeah, if you got one that would be good. If not, I'll just beat 'em to death with my bare hands. Makes no difference to me.
311510203         //  Should be one in here somewhere... Ah, here it is, here you go.
311510204         //  Thanks.
311510210         //  Ready, Vito? C'mon, let's go get these fucks.
311510220         //  We'll get that bastard, I swear it! He'll pay for what he's done.
311510230         //  And what about what you've done? Everything would be fine if you hadn't come up with that stupid fucking idea of yours.
311510240         //  Have you got a problem?!
311510250         //  Damn right I do! You're the high falutin' wee gobshite that got our lads killed! Why didn't you just kill Scaletta yourself?!
311510260         //  I told you! I chased him, but I lost him! That coward ran away! But I'll find him, and when I do...
311510270         //  You were the one who ran away, asshole.
311510280         //  Ah fuck!
311510290         //  You... You've got some balls...
311510300         //  Yes, I do.
311510301         //  Hey, there's more of 'em in that car! Let's go, they're getting away.
311510302         //  Alright, come on. You drive.
311510303         //  Come on, Vito, faster! We're gonna lose 'em.
311510304         //  Step on it, Vito, he's getting away.
311510305         //  You see what happened to these guys!?  Same's gonna happen to the rest of you if anybody says a word to the cops. You got me?
311510306         //  Good...  Now why don't you all go home spend some time with your kids, so they don't end up like this garbage here.
311510307         //  Let's go, Vito! We gotta get closer.
311510308         //  Ahh shit, we lost them. Ah come on, let's just get out of here.
311510309         //  Fine... I need a drink anyway.
311510310         //  Nice speech. Feel better?
311510311         //  That takes care of that. Stupid fucks...
311510312         //  Alright, that's enough excitement for one night. Let's go home and have a drink.
311510320         //  Much better.
311510330         //  Hey, we might as well get some cash out of this, right? Check the counter!
311510340         //  But hurry it up, the cops are gonna be here any minute.
311510350         //  Well, that takes care of that, huh?
311510360         //  Yeah. But it don't give me my house back.
311510370         //  Don't worry. Business is looking good, you'll have the cash for a new one real soon.
311510380         //  Yeah, I sure as hell hope so.
311510390         //  Alright, let's go back home.
311510500         //  So, you feel better now?
311510510         //  Not really. What we did back there doesn't even start to make up for it.
311510520         //  Hey, all that stuff that got burnt up, it's just things, Vito.
311510530         //  Just things? Hey, those were my things Joe. Why do you think I do the shit we do anyways? It's to buy things, ya know, suits, cars, broads, houses. Now I'm back to scratch. And all my damn cash was in that house too. I promised myself I'd never be poor again, end up a fucking wharf rat like my old man.
311510540         //  Hey, hey, I understand. Don't worry, we'll think of something. You'll be back on your feet in no time.
311510550         //  The glass is always fucking half full with you, isn't it?
311510560         //  So, it's ok if I crash on your couch, right?
311510570         //  I can do one better than that. Here, take these keys. They're for Marty's apartment. I'm trying to get rid of it right now for his mother. So uh, you might as well use it while I do.
311510580         //  Thanks. I guess.
311510590         //  Don't thank me, buddy. You're too old to be sleeping on my couch. Plus I just bought the thing. I don't want you lousing it up. Marty's apartment's over in Oyster Bay.
311510600         //  OK, I'll see ya around, I guess....
311510610         //  See ya, buddy. Sorry about tonight.
311510620         //  What a fucking dump.
311510630         //  God, I wish I had the cash for a hotel.
311990001         //  Things were kind of quiet for a couple weeks after that. Marty finally got to play gangster. Can't help but feel bad for the kid. Bringing him along wasn't the smartest thing Joe ever did, and Joe knew it. But hey, we all make bad decisions.  (doorbell rings - Henry is outside).
312010001         //  Fuck, this is creepy.
312010011         //  My house burnt to the ground, along with almost every penny I had. There was even some trouble with the cops, but Eddie took care of that. And since I didn't have any insurance, I had to live in this shithole of an apartment 'til I could get back on my feet...
312010012         //  At least I managed to save Leo. He disappeared without a trace. I doubt Frank Vinci even knew where he went. And even though Henry failed to deliver on the contract, Eddie still brought him in when he heard Leo had skipped town. Me and Joe had a new partner.
312010013         //  My house burnt to the ground, along with almost every penny I had. There was even some trouble with the cops, but Eddie took care of that. And since I didn't have any insurance, so I had to live in this shithole of an apartment 'til I could get back on my feet...
312010014         //  It was good to have Henry back, but I couldn't get Leo out of my head. I'm not proud of what happened, but that's the way it goes, I guess. Business is business.
312010015         //  My house burned to the ground, along with almost every penny I had. There was even some trouble with the cops, but Eddie took care of that.  And since I didn't have any insurance, I had to live in this shithole of an apartment 'til I could get back on my feet...
312010016         //  At least I managed to save Leo. He disappeared without a trace. I owe Henry big time for that. Eddie brought him into the crew just like he said he would, and me and Joe had a new partner.
312010020         //  Hey, Vito, it's Henry.
312010030         //  Hey.
312010040         //  Listen, I'm setting up something big - I want you to come in on it. If you're interested in hearing more, come meet me at Lincoln Park. And bring a piece.
312010050         //  OK. I'll see you there.
312010063         //  Alright, Vito. We'll take your car.
312020001         //  Alright, follow me, fellas. And let me do all the talking.
312020006         //  Bruno always uses the same quote. I go to church on Sundays, so I asked the priest one time.
312020007         //  Yeah, and I can understand why you don't. They use big words, there's no hookers, and the food's lousy.
312020008         //  Nice job, Henry.
312020009         //  Of course. I told you he'd give us the dough, didn't I?
312020010         //  OK, this is it. Stop here.
312020011         //  OK, guess this is the place.
312020012         //  So who is this guy we're going to see, Henry?
312020013         //  His name's Bruno. He's one of the only guys in town who can do a loan this big.
312020014         //  What if he doesn't give it to us, then what?
312020015         //  Then the deal's off. But don't worry, I know this guy. He'll give us the money.
312020016         //  There ain't nobody else we can get this kinda money from?
312020020         //  So, how come you know the Bible so good, Henry? You read it or something?
312020023         //  There's three other guys that I know of. But if you want to ask Carlo or Frank Vinci for thirty-five grand, be my guest.
312020024         //  Yeah, no thanks.
312020025         //  Who's the third guy?
312020026         //  He ain't in business no more. Somebody blew up a room full of his guys then shot him point bank in the face with a Tommy gun.
312020027         //  Oh.  That guy.
312020028         //  Come on.  We said we wasn't gonna talk about that.
312020029         //  Alright. So, Henry, what is this guy rich or something?
312020030         //  I think he gets his money from some of the bosses from out of town who sit on the Commission.
312020031         //  Yeah? No shit!
312020032         //  Yeah. Which is why we can't stiff the guy... Besides, we gotta keep this quiet.
312020033         //  Can we trust him?
312020034         //  Sure. Wiseguys been borrowing money from this guy forever. Long as we pay him back on time, we won't have a problem.
312020035         //  Goddammit, Vito! You better go get us a new car, now!
312020037         //  What do you want me to sit on your lap? Go find a car that more than two guys can fit in!
312020038         //  What is this a fucking joke? We need something with more than two seats, numbnuts.
312020039         //  Go get us a bigger car, now!
312020040         //  You go to church?!
312020041         //  Vito, c'mon. Too late to change your mind now.
312020042         //  Hey Vito, you coming or what?
312020045         //  Alright fellas, follow me. And let me do all the talking. This guy's a real sheister.
312020046         //  Alright, we're almost there.
312020047         //  This is it, stop here.
312020055         //  Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.
312020056         //  Jeez, I ain't been there since '45.
312020057         //  What, that time your mother made you go to confession?
312020058         //  Yeah, that time she smacked me for checking out some chick's coolie. Ah, God rest her soul.
312020059         //  How about you Joe?  How long's it been?
312020060         //  Alright, stop right here, Vito.
312020061         //  Easter...
312020062         //  Ah, that ain't too bad.
312020063         //  ...1941.
312020064         //  I take that back then. You're going straight to hell.
312020065         //  What you're just figuring that out now?
312020066         //  Don't worry, I'll save seats for the both of you's...
312020067         //  Drive through the gate, and into the yard.
312020069         //  Alright, park right here next to that truck.
312020070         //  Now just follow me.
312020071         //  Greetings, Mister Tomasino.
312020072         //  Follow me, gentlemen. Mr. Wong is expecting you.
312020079         //  Staff member only. Please, go now.
312020081         //  Hey. You leave now. No gwai-lo allow.
312020082         //  Mister, you leave now. Worker only here.
312020083         //  Hey, what're you looking at, huh?
312020084         //  n_Huh? You talking to me? Go away, I ain't got time for you.
312020085         //  Oh yeah, that's right... that retard don't speak no Cantonese...
312020090         //  What the fuck?!
312020091         //  Aw shit, can't go back that way... Run!
312020092         //  Move it, goddammit!
312020093         //  Get out of there, Vito!
312020094         //  You nuts, Vito? Take cover, for chrissake.
312020098         //  Nice one, Joe, nice!
312020099         //  Holy shit!
312020100         //  Shhhhhit!
312020110         //  Great, now every cop in the damn city's gonna be here.
312020120         //  Alright, fellas. The hard part's over. Now we just gotta make the exchange and we're done.
312020130         //  Sounds good to me...
312020140         //  Where we headed?
312020145         //  Hunters, I got it all lined up.
312020148         //  Sorry mister, uh, no speak American.
312020149         //  Hey, Frank Sinatra, are you lost?
312020152         //  Are you lost, mister?
312020153         //  n_Hey, somebody order a pizza?
312020154         //  n_Mr. Wong hire a new white guy?
312020157         //  Sorry, I on break.
312020158         //  n_You crazy! You want us go boom?!
312020159         //  n_No worry - it's just one smoke.
312020160         //  Die already, will you?
312020161         //  n_You stupid? You see that big gas tank?
312020162         //  n_Aiyuh! You sound like my wife and five sister!
312020163         //  n_This here, and this here. And now.. Fuck, why it doesn't work? I fix three time already!
312020164         //  n_One more try and it should work or else... Agh, dammit.
312020165         //  n_Aw, stupid fucking shit... Wait, why am I speaking English?
312020166         //  n_Ah, I tell them not to throw it away... It should be in here... Somewhere.
312020167         //  n_Eh, you here to see Mister Wong, or Mister "Wang?"
312020168         //  n_Uh... Pee pee must exit the dragon...
312020170         //  Let's get the hell out of here. Head for the car! Vito, you drive!
312020171         //  Get your ass over here, Vito!
312020172         //  Don't just fucking stand there, Vito! Move!
312020173         //  Hey, move it, Vito! We can't wait forever!
312020174         //  Let's go, Vito!
312020175         //  I got your back, go!
312020176         //  Go! I'm covering you!
312020177         //  Vito! Kick the door in!
312020178         //  Let's go already, kick it in!
312020179         //  Something wrong with your legs? Kick the door in!
312020183         //  Ahhh! It burns!
312020184         //  Hey, let him burn. Save your ammo.
312020185         //  Go! C'mon, move, Vito!
312020221         //  Eyuh! Uh...
312020230         //  Shit, that was fucking close ...
312020240         //  It's not over yet! They're coming after us.
312020250         //  Fuck, lose 'em!
312020258         //  Shit! They're still on our tail!
312020259         //  Vito, lose these guys!
312020260         //  Alright, looks like we lost 'em... Nice job, Vito.
312020301         //  Hey. We got some business with your boss.
312020340         //  Ah, shit!
312020350         //  Who the hell are these guys!?
312020360         //  Here comes more of 'em!
312020370         //  Hold on... I got him...
312020380         //  Bingo.
312020390         //  Nice, but there's still too many of 'em. Come on!
312020391         //  Who the fuck are these guys?
312020392         //  Come on, this way!
312020393         //  Come on! There's too many of 'em!
312020394         //  Where we going?
312020395         //  We're getting the hell out of here!
312020396         //  Come on, Vito. Get over here!
312020397         //  Jesus Christ, we're gonna get our asses shot off up here!
312020398         //  Goddammit...
312020399         //  Follow me you two. Let's go!
312020400         //  Move your asses!
312020401         //  Come on, fellas! Up the stairs!
312020402         //  Now ain't the time to be a hero, Vito!
312020420         //  Come on, come on, I got you covered!
312020430         //  Vito, watch our back!
312020440         //  Stay away from these windows, fellas.
312020450         //  Dammit, Vito, stay down!
312020460         //  Feel like I'm in a fucking shooting gallery over here.
312020470         //  Behind you!
312020480         //  No shit! They got fucking grenades!
312020500         //  You alright over there, Henry?
312020510         //  Na, I'm fine. Worry about yourself!
312020520         //  No sense staying up here! Lets get down there!
312020540         //  Ahh shit! More of 'em!
312020550         //  You gotta be kidding me...
312020560         //  Can't believe this is fucking happening...
312020570         //  That takes care of that...
312020580         //  These guys just don't fucking learn...
312020581         //  Don't let 'em get up here!
312020584         //  Henry, you alright?
312030050         //  Here we are. Let me do the talking. These are tough guys, so no wiseass comments. Alright, Joe?
312030054         //  Alright, drive up to the gate, Vito.
312030100         //  What the fuck was that, Henry?
312030110         //  No idea. Somebody else must have known about the deal. Those definitely weren't real cops.
312030120         //  Maybe it was the chinks trying to fuck us?
312030130         //  I doubt it. Look, I'll figure it out, but first we gotta unload this stuff. Vito, take us to the old warehouse in Hunters.
312030140         //  Alright. Hope this next deal goes better than the last one.
312030150         //  It will. Not like it could go any worse, right?
312030160         //  So who we selling the stuff to?
312030170         //  A bunch of different guys.
312030180         //  Whoa, whoa, whoa! What do you mean "a bunch of different guys"?
312030190         //  A bunch of different guys. What, did all that shooting back there make you deaf?
312030200         //  I thought you said we were just moving this garbage from one place to another.
312030210         //  Yeah, well, ya make a lot more money if ya sell it in smaller amounts.
312030220         //  Would've been really nice to know before I agreed to go in on this.
312030230         //  If I did, from the way you were talking back in the park, you probably wouldn't have.
312030240         //  Yea, Exactly.
312030250         //  Hey, the best you could hope for right now is to spend the next 30 years of your life breakin' your ass for Eddie and Carlo before you either get bumped off or end up back in the can. The only time you're ever gonna see cash like this is if you stick your neck out.
312030260         //  Besides, I ever steer you wrong?
312030270         //  Well... There was the OPA job and that time we almost got killed when we whacked that fat fuck in Sand Island.
312030280         //  Alright alright, enough. None of that matters after today. Let's just get to Hunters. And don't worry, we're never gonna have to see these scumbags again after today.
312030290         //  Unless this turns into a regular thing for us...
312030300         //  Whoa... Alright, let's just concentrate on getting through this one before we go making plans like that, alright?
312030310         //  Hey, I'm just saying...
312030320         //  Vito's right. Let's just get through the rest of the day. After that, smooth sailing, fellas.
312030330         //  You know I heard about a loanshark named Bruno once, must be the same guy.
312030340         //  Yeah? What did you hear?
312030350         //  Well, you know Micky the Crab, right?
312030360         //  What, the guy who cleans the bathroom at Carlo's joint?
312030370         //  Yeah, the guy who's only got a finger and thumb on his left hand. Guess how that happened? I heard he owed a lot of money to some yid from Southport. You get my drift?
312030380         //  Oh, right, I get the picture.
312030390         //  Haha, don't worry, though. Crab's a moron, nutn' like that's gonna happen to us.
312030400         //  I should go with Henry and Joe.
312030410         //  Gotta let Henry pick up the stuff first.
312990001         //  Just about everything I owned went up in the fire. I was back at square one, sleeping in a dead man's bed and trying to figure out a way to get back everything I'd lost.  (phone call from Henry)
313010000         //  Hello?
313010005         //  Barbaro's Bordello. You got the money, we got the honeys.
313010010         //  Vito, it's Henry. We got a problem.
313010020         //  What kind of problem?
313010030         //  Eddie paid me a visit. Carlo knows about the deal, and he sent Eddie to pick up his cut.
313010040         //  Ugh... How much?
313010050         //  Sixty grand.
313010060         //  Fuck, that much?! What're we gonna do?
313010070         //  I don't know, we don't even have enough left for Bruno. Meet me in the park, I don't want to talk about this over the phone.
313010080         //  OK, I'll be right there.
313010081         //  I'm gonna kill every last one of you's!
313010082         //  C'mere, you little yellow fucks!
313010083         //  I'm gonna chop you up when I'm done with you, you sick bastards!
313010090         //  Joe. We gotta go.
313010100         //  What? What for?
313010110         //  Now, Joe. I'll tell you on the way.
313010120         //  Alright. Girls, lock up when you leave. Me and Vito got business.
313010130         //  So what the hell's going on?
313010140         //  That was Henry on the phone. Carlo found out about the deal.
313010150         //  Ahhh shhhhhit! Does he know we was involved?
313010160         //  I don't think so. Let's talk about it in the car.
313010170         //  Where we headed?
313010180         //  Lincoln Park.
313010190         //  We meeting Henry there?
313010200         //  Yeah.
313010210         //  Alright, so what'd Henry say on the phone? He OK?
313010220         //  Sounded OK. But Carlo took his cut of the take.
313010230         //  Fuck... Just like Henry said he'd do if he found out.
313010240         //  Yeah, but now the problem is we don't even got enough to pay Bruno back.
313010250         //  Aah, shit! What the hell are we gonna do?
313010260         //  I don't know. We'll figure it out when we get to the park.
313010270         //  Yeah. Henry'll know what to do.
313020010         //  Of all the ways to kill a guy... Goddamn bullet would've been enough.
313020011         //  These bastards are sick in the head, Vito... They're gonna fucking die. All of 'em.
313020012         //  I mean... Why do it like that... And in the middle of the park...
313020013         //  Like I said, they're sick. I'm gonna turn them into chop fucking suey.
313020014         //  Hey, not for nothing - we don't even know how many of them there are.
313020015         //  Yeah, and it don't matter.
313020016         //  Hey, Henry's dead. What do you want us to get killed too? We gotta do this smart, Joe.
313020017         //  It don't matter how we do it. As long as they're fucking dead when we're done!
313020018         //  Alright listen, there's probably more than two of them.
313020019         //  So what? The more, the fucking merrier!
313020020         //  So, there's only two of us. And unless maybe you want to call Carlo and tell him all about the mess we're in, ask him to send some guys over here...
313020021         //  Alright fine, I get it.
313020022         //  Alright, so promise me you're not gonna go in guns blazing as usual. We gotta do this the smart way. Alright?
313020023         //  Don't get too close - I wanna follow this fuck so we can burn his whole operation to the ground.
313030010         //  I'm gonna rip his little yellow balls off!
313030020         //  Hey, calm down. First we gotta find out where he's going.
313030030         //  Step on it, Vito! He's getting away!
313030040         //  Don't let him get away!
313030050         //  Vito, move it, we're gonna lose him!
313030060         //  Step on it or we'll lose him!
313030070         //  Stay closer, otherwise he's gonna get away.
313030080         //  Stay back or he's gonna notice us!
313030090         //  Slow it down, Vito, we're too close!
313030100         //  He's gonna see us, slow down a little!
313030110         //  Careful, Vito, we don't want him to see us!
313030120         //  Slow down, Vito, you're getting too close!
313030130         //  I'm doing the best I can!
313030140         //  This guy drives like a chin-- nevermind.
313030150         //  I know, I know, I can see him too, you know.
313030160         //  Fuck! Dammit, Vito! We fucking lost him!
313030170         //  Fuck, he saw us! I told you.
313030180         //  I'd love to shoot that bastard right now...
313030190         //  Good, he still ain't seen us...
313030200         //  Nice job, Vito. That assholes gonna lead us right to 'em.
313030210         //  Alright, just don't lose him.
313030220         //  Why the fuck would they do something like this?
313050010         //  Where the hell is that prick?
313050020         //  He's gotta be around here somewhere! Let's keep going.
313050021         //  Goddammit, Joe. You see? Why didn't you just bang the damn gong while you were at it?
313050022         //  Pipe down and help me waste these little fucks.
313050023         //  Take 'em out quick, Vito. We gotta find Wong!
313050024         //  C'mon, Vito, waste 'em all.
313050025         //  Kill that asshole on the stairs!
313050026         //  C'mon, Vito, show 'em who they fucked with.
313050027         //  Come on, you little fucks!
313050028         //  This is for Henry, you bastards!
313050029         //  Tell your boss I'm coming for him.
313050030         //  Jeez, these fucks just keep on coming. How many more they got back there?
313050031         //  Don't matter. I got plenty of bullets left.
313050032         //  Alright, you go first, Vito.  You're a smaller target.
313050033         //  Thanks... Fat ass...
313050034         //  Hey, you said we gotta do this smart, right?
313050035         //  Jeez, get a load of this place, will you?
313050036         //  Look at that. First fat chink I ever seen!
313050037         //  Come on. Wong's gotta be here somewhere.
313050038         //  See? Ain't so bad so far, right?
313050039         //  Yeah, but what if somebody recognizes us and Carlo hears about it?
313050040         //  That's why we ain't leaving no witnesses. There's probably more of 'em down here. Get ready.
313050041         //  Come on, let's go, Vito! Get in the elevator!
313060080         //  What are these guys, deaf? There's a war going on, and they're walking around like fucking zombies...
313060090         //  Uh... I don't like this...
313080040         //  With any luck this is for that locked door we passed on the way up.
313080050         //  Vito, come here, this should be the way out...
313080055         //  Ah fuck, the cops.
313080056         //  Shit! What are we gonna do now?
313080057         //  Like I said, no witnesses. Come on.
313080058         //  Fuck! There's cops everywhere! Move, Vito!
313080063         //  Shoot, Vito! Come on! No witnesses!
313080100         //  That was uh... That was fucked up, huh?
313080110         //  Yeah. I don't wanna talk about it. Just get me back to my place, would ya?
313080120         //  Alright.
313110060         //  Watch out, they're shooting from up top!
313110070         //  Get the guy on the stairs!
313110080         //  Up there in the window!
313110090         //  Get the asshole behind the bar!
313110100         //  C'mon, Vito, let's move up.
313110101         //  You want me to get you a napkin next time I reload?
313110102         //  Why even bother? You're gonna be hungry again in 10 minutes.
313110110         //  Right behind you.
313110120         //  Watch out - here comes more of 'em!
313110130         //  Come on, Vito, move, for chrissake!
313110140         //  Come on, help me out or we're gonna die here!
313110150         //  Hey, gimme a hand here, will ya?
313110160         //  I could use a little help here, Joe!
313110170         //  That was for Henry, you fuck...
313110180         //  Hey, leave some of these little bastards for me!
313110190         //  Shit! You OK?
313110200         //  Yeah, just a scratch, I'm fine.
313110210         //  Woho! Nice shot, Vito!
313110240         //  That's it, Vito. Kill 'em all. Every last one of 'em.
313110250         //  Jesus! Watch yourself, Vito!
313110260         //  Joe, watch your back!
313110270         //  Shit, there's too many of 'em!
313110280         //  What are we gonna do?
313110290         //  Alright, you go first, I'll cover you.
313110300         //  How'd that feel, huh?!
313110310         //  Right between your slanty eyes...
313110320         //  Little ching-chong fuck...
313110330         //  Special delivery for ya...
313110340         //  Haha... Bingo...
313110350         //  n_ laughing
313110380         //  Where the fuck are they all coming from?
313110390         //  Must be a tunnel to China around here somewhere...
313110400         //  Shh, be quiet, Vito.
313110410         //  Since when are you concerned about making noise?
313110420         //  There's too many of 'em, just take him out nice and quiet.
313110425         //  Nice. Alright, let's just sneak through here.
313110430         //  Are you deaf or what?! I said we should be quiet!
313110440         //  More of 'em in the elevator!
313110450         //  These guys are like fucking cockroaches...
313110460         //  Looks like this place won't be opening up for a while.
313110470         //  If we had the time I'd burn it to the damn ground.
313110510         //  Like I said, no witnesses. Come on...
313110520         //  Shit! What are we gonna do now?
313110600         //  Die, you piece of shit!
313110610         //  That's right, eat shit, asshole!
313110620         //  Come on, you little bastards!
313110630         //  Stick that up your lo-mein!
313110640         //  Come on! How do you like that, huh?
313110650         //  Say goodnight, Charlie Chan!
313110660         //  You fucked with the wrong guys, didn't you?
313110670         //  Come on! Who taught you assholes how to shoot!?
313110680         //  Get back here, Vito. Where you going?
313110690         //  Where you going, Vito? That's the way we came in!
313110700         //  Wrong way, numbnuts. Follow me!
313110710         //  Where you going? What are you just gonna leave me here?!
313110720         //  I gotta get back to Joe.
313110730         //  I can't leave Joe all by himself.
313110740         //  Where am I going? This ain't the right way.
313110750         //  Come on, let's get down there!
313110760         //  I smell a kitchen down there. Let's check it out.
313110780         //  Alright, Vito, 5 more to go!
313110790         //  Alright, there's three more of them.
313110800         //  Two more to go, and that's it.
313110810         //  One more and we're done.
313110820         //  Alright, that was the last of them.
313110825         //  Four more to go, Vito!
313110830         //  C'mon, Vito, through this door!
313110840         //  C'mon, Vito, get in the elevator.
313110850         //  What the hell are you doing? Get in the elevator!
313110870         //  Ahh... shit...
313110880         //  Aw, fuck this! C'mon, Vito, let's get out of here!
313110890         //  There's too many of them! Find us a car, quick!
313110900         //  Put your foot down, Vito! They're right on our tail!
313110905         //  Alright... we lost 'em.
313110910         //  Take me to my place, Vito. I need a fucking drink...
313111000         //  Drop your weapons, you are surrounded.
313990001         //  Things were really looking up. Henry even set up another deal - should've known it was all too good to be true (phone call from Henry interrupts the hooker party)
314010001         //  Uh... I should see who that is... Might be important.
314010010         //  Vito. You ready?
314010020         //  Does it sound like I'm ready? You just woke me up.
314010030         //  So get the fuck up. If we don't get the money for Bruno today, we're fucked.
314010040         //  Where the hell are we gonna get our hands on fifty-five grand, huh?
314010050         //  I don't know, but we sure as hell ain't gonna find it laying around in bed. I got something for starters. A job from Eddie with a big payout.
314010060         //  No shit?
314010070         //  Yeah. I'll pick you up in few minutes, so get dressed, grab a gun and wait for me outside. I'll tell you more in the car.
314010080         //  This better not be one of your brilliant ideas, Joe...
314010090         //  Hey. I'm not in the mood.
314010100         //  Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. I'm still half asleep over here.
314010110         //  Yeah, yeah, whatever. So you in or not?
314010230         //  What do you want?
314010240         //  I need to see Bruno.
314010250         //  You got his money?
314010260         //  Not yet, but...
314010270         //  Come back when you do.
314010280         //  I don't have enough cash yet.
314010290         //  I gotta get the rest of the money first.
314020010         //  Hey, I'm looking for Joe. Anybody seen him or know where he was going?
314020011         //  Joe's still not home. Something's wrong. I gotta go find him.
314020012         //  Joe's not here. I gotta find out where he is.
314020020         //  Hey. You seen Joe? I was supposed to meet him and he didn't show. Any idea where he might be?
314020030         //  Hey did Joe stop by today? I need to talk to him - I can't find him anywheres.
314020035         //  OK, I'll head over there. See you.
314020040         //  OK, thanks.
314020045         //  Great, I'll check it out.
314020050         //  Thanks a lot. See you.
314020060         //  Thanks, Charlie. I'm gonna head over there right now. See you.
314020100         //  Yeah, Joe was here earlier. Ummm... When he was leaving, he was saying something about the Maltese Falcon.
314020101         //  Joe? Try the nearest bar...
314020102         //  Yeah, he was here asking about a job, but I didn't have nothing for him. Said he had to pick up something at Giuseppe's.
314020103         //  I don't know. Why don't you try Giuseppe's.
314020110         //  Hola, mi amigo! Yeah, Joe was here. Said he had something cooking with Giuseppe and he was headed over there. Might still be there.
314020120         //  Na, Joe ain't been here. I need to talk to him too. I want to know if he had anything to do with Henry's deal. If you see him, you tell him to come see me. He'd better not've had anything to do with this.
314020281         //  Maybe Joe checked in with Eddie at the Falcon.
314020282         //  Let's try Giuseppe next. He keeps his ear to the ground.
314020360         //  C'mon, cmon!
314020370         //  Pete told you what to do, so fucking do it!
314020375         //  Throw those guns on the floor and do it fast!
314020380         //  That can't be all of 'em!
314020390         //  Pete said all your guns, so do it!
314020400         //  What's taking so long?
314020410         //  You're asking for it!
314020520         //  Go ahead.
314020530         //  I said move it.
314020540         //  Don't make it worse for yourself.
314020545         //  You piss me off enough, I'll drop you right here.
314020550         //  Nice and easy. Go over to the car.
314020560         //  Alright, stop.
314020570         //  Where the hell are you going? I said go over to the car!
314020580         //  Cut the shit and stand by the car!
314030890         //  n_What? What's nuts?
314031110         //  n_What are we gonna do with that fuck? You know, when the boss gets what he wants from him?
314031120         //  n_Give him a bath.
314031130         //  n_What?
314031140         //  n_You know, in the concrete.
314031150         //  n_Hehe, good idea. Why didn't I think of that?
314031160         //  n_Well, nobody ever accused you of being the brightest bulb on the tree. What would you do with him?
314031170         //  n_Dunno, set him on fire?
314031180         //  n_On fire? Why?
314031190         //  n_'Cause it'd be fun to watch, especially if he was still breathing.
314031200         //  n_Alright, that's just sick.
314031210         //  n_What? And throwing him into wet concrete and letting him drown isn't?
314031220         //  n_Hey, we're gonna shoot him first. We're not monsters...
314040010         //  n_What the fuck?... Why you boys leaving? The fun's just getting started!
314040020         //  n_Shit! They're loose!
314040030         //  You're right. The real fun is just getting started.
314040040         //  n_Come on, asshole!
314050580         //  n_What the fuck?! Who's that?! Hey! Barbaro's escaping!
314050581         //  n_Uuwwooaah! Fuck this!
314050582         //  n_Agh...let me live, please!...geh..
314050583         //  n_Please, don't do it!
314050584         //  n_Oh please, come on, pal. Don't do this!
314050585         //  n_No, please, I got a family!
314050586         //  n_Oh shit, I don't wanna die, please!
314050587         //  n_Enough, please, enough!
314050588         //  n_C'mon, have a fuckin' heart!
314050589         //  n_Nehh...I really don't need this shit.
314050590         //  n_Shit! Heads up, guys! Barbaro's getting away!
314050591         //  n_Fuck this, I'm out of here!
314050592         //  n_This ain't worth it, I'm outta here.
314050593         //  n_Hey... what was that?
314050594         //  n_Eat that, you asswipe.
314050595         //  n_How do ya like that, huh?
314050596         //  n_Come on!
314050597         //  n_Over there!
314050598         //  n_He's over there!
314050599         //  n_Go, go, I'll cover ya!
314050600         //  n_Hey! Barbaro's getting away!
314050601         //  n_That asshole killed him!
314050602         //  n_What the fuck was that noise?
314050603         //  You picked the wrong fuckin' guy, pal.
314050604         //  Get your ass over here, Vito!
314050605         //  Vito, come here, this should be the way out...
314050606         //  What do you want, a hug?
314050607         //  Go fuck yourself.
314050608         //  You go first, I'll cover you.
314050610         //  n_That bastard's making a run for it! Get him!
314050611         //  Hey, what's with all the shooting?
314050612         //  Ah shit, it's Barbaro and his fucking boyfriend! Quick.... Get over here!
314050613         //  Aye-O, that shit's flammable!
314050614         //  Don't let those cocksuckers get away!
314050615         //  All of you's, get in here, now!
314050616         //  Hey, I thought it was just Barbaro? Who's the skinny prick?
314050620         //  n_Shit, Barbaro's trying to escape! I need some help here!
314050628         //  You fuck, fuck you... You filthy fuck... Come on, come on, you fuck!
314050629         //  Ohhhh. Jesus Christ... I feel like I'm half dead.
314050630         //  n_Where the fuck you think you're going! Hey, guys! Barbaro's escaping!
314050631         //  Consider yourself lucky. You look like you're all dead.
314050632         //  Thanks, Vito. You're a real fucking pal.
314050633         //  We gotta get out of here before we end up in the fucking foundation.
314050634         //  If I see that old fuck Vinci I'm gonna blow his fucking head off.
314050635         //  Where the hell we going?
314050636         //  I don't know... How about down? That sound good to you?
314050637         //  Uhhg... good to see you got this all planned out.
314050638         //  Hey, Marco Polo. The way down's over here! Stop fucking around.
314050639         //  This way, Vito.
314050640         //  Holy shit - why's every asshole in town here?
314050760         //  Vito, they fucked me up pretty good. I think I need a doctor.
314050770         //  OK, let's get you over to El Greco.
314060010         //  Hey. I need to see Bruno.
314060020         //  Got the money?
314060030         //  Yeah.
314060040         //  Come on in then. You're lucky, we were just about to leave.
314060100         //  Nrgh... my chest. Every time I breathe, I think they broke my damn ribs...
314060110         //  Take it easy. El Greco's gonna fix you up.
314060120         //  Yeah, sure. Oh fuck - every time I cough it feels like I'm being stabbed in the chest.
314060130         //  Just sit back, the more you whine about it the worse it's gonna be.
314060140         //  Listen, Vito. Thanks for coming after me, and for almost getting yourself killed.
314060150         //  Hey, we're in this together, right? Just like always. Now just sit the fuck back before you get blood all over my pants and I really do stab you in the chest.
314060160         //  You picked a hell of a time to turn into a fucking comedian.
314500120         //  Can it at least wait 'til later? I didn't sleep too good last night. Not sure how much help I'm gonna be right now.
314500130         //  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you, but it's gotta be done right now. Listen, if you don't want to go, no sweat, I'll just grab somebody else. Maybe that new skinny guy...
314500140         //  Alright, fine by me.
314500150         //  Alright. And hey, I was at Harry's just now and he said he wants to talk to you about something. So go grab yourself a cup of coffee, and a nice big bowl of cheer-the-fuck-up, and go see him. Hopefully he's got something for you. I'll see you later, Vito.
314500160         //  Alright, see you.
314500170         //  Sure, why not. How long 'til you get here?
314500171         //  I'm calling from the gun shop around the corner. I'll be at your place in a minute.
314500172         //  Alright, I'll wait for you out front. See you soon.
314500173         //  Alright, I'll wait for you out back. I'll see you soon.
314500180         //  Hey, what's with the fancy wheels?
314500190         //  Eddie gave it to us just for this job. Nice, huh?
314500200         //  You drive. My head's still pounding from last night. We're going to Greenfield.
314500210         //  Guess you hit the sauce pretty hard too, huh?
314500220         //  Yeah, I couldn't sleep either. Nothing a bottle of scotch couldn't fix, though.
314500230         //  Head over to Greenfield.
314500240         //  Alright. So now can you tell me what this is all about?
314500250         //  We're just gonna drive there, pop some guy, and drive away. Should be a piece of cake.
314500260         //  Why?
314500290         //  Eddie said it's a favor for some family from another city, unfinished business. He gave me this envelope with all the instructions, said it's gotta be clean and it's gotta be done today.
314500300         //  Why the hell doesn't the other family just do it themselves?
314500310         //  Eddie said they been looking for this guy for a while and they just found him. They're afraid that if it ain't done right away, the guy's gonna disappear again. Here, here's a picture of him.
314500320         //  What'd this guy do?
314500330         //  Says here he ratted his family out to the Feds.
314500340         //  Guy's got it coming to him then.
314500350         //  But wait a minute... If he cooperated with the Feds, that means he was under protection, right? What if he still is?
314500360         //  Even if he is, we're getting paid a few grand for the job, so it's more than worth the risk.
314500370         //  Ah, if you say so...
314500380         //  Hey, we need every penny we can get right now, right? So after we finish this job, we'll split up and look for other work.
314500390         //  Alright.
314500400         //  Says here they want us to give him a message before we do it. Here, here it is.
314500410         //  Hmm, hmm ... OK, got it.
314500420         //  And hey, if you see Eddie later - not a word about yesterday. We was never there. Last chink we saw was delivering egg foo yung. You get it?
314500430         //  Yeah. What do you think I am, some kind of retard?
314500440         //  Jury's still out on that one pal. Just making sure you don't slip up, that's all.
314500450         //  Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you!? Stop playing bumper cars, will you?
314500460         //  Be more careful.
314500470         //  Watch it! What the fuck's up with you, Vito?
314500480         //  Shit... Get rid of 'em. We can't go there with the cops up our ass.
314500490         //  Remember what you gotta say?
314500500         //  Yeah.
314500510         //  Alright, here we go then.
314500520         //  Like I said, piece of cake...
314500530         //  Not so fast. Look! Those guys over there!
314500540         //  Shit! Go go! Let's get the fuck out of here!
314500550         //  Hey! Stop!
314500551         //  This is Agent Cox. Need police support in Greenfield. Now, goddammit!
314500560         //  Forget it, Vito! Let's just get the hell out of here!
314500570         //  Those were Feds!
314500580         //  That asshole really was under protection!
314500590         //  Eddie's famous for conveniently leaving out little details like that.
314500600         //  Maybe he didn't know. Don't matter now, we gotta lose 'em!
314500610         //  Ah fuck, that was close. Get me to Kingston, will you? I got a car waiting there.
314500620         //  What about the money?
314500630         //  Hey, I almost forgot. Eddie paid me in advance, so here's your share.
314500640         //  Alright, good luck getting your half of the money. Come by my place when you're done.
314500650         //  OK, I'll see you later.
314500660         //  Oh yeah - I was at Harry's before and he was asking about you. Said he needed your help with something. You should stop by there.
314500670         //  Alright.
314501000         //  No time for that. We got a job to do!
314520250         //  C'mon, grab the shotgun. They'll shit their pants.
314520260         //  Hey, where are you going!? Stop fucking around and follow us.
314520270         //  C'mon, let's get this over with.
314520280         //  Hey! What's the hold up? Let's go!
314520290         //  Stop fucking around and grab that fucking gun.
314520300         //  We can't show up empty-handed.
314520310         //  Pick up the gun, asshole!
314520400         //  These fucking guys really think who the fuck they are...
314520410         //  This ain't the first time I had problems with them, you know.
314520420         //  You know how many of 'em there is?
314520430         //  Three, four, ten... How the fuck should I know. Does it matter?
314520440         //  Na na, it's just uh... What are we gonna do to 'em?
314520450         //  All depends on how the uh "labor negotiations" go...
314520460         //  Just let me do all the talking. I don't need you's opening your mouths and proving how stunad you's are.
314530010         //  Guess it's just me and you then.
314530020         //  Looks like it's just the two of us. I hope that's enough.
314530030         //  Alright, that's three against five. Let's go!
314530040         //  OK, the odds are even - now let's teach that fat fuck a lesson.
314530050         //  Alright, follow me, guys.
314530060         //  This is crazy, fellas. You shouldn't be doing this... Vito can handle himself.
314530070         //  Some extra firepower ain't gonna hurt.
314530071         //  Let's go, Vito. We got your back.
314530080         //  Vito, you're making the biggest mistake in your life!
314530081         //  You're gonna die here, Vito. Just like your father.
314530082         //  What are you thinking, Vito? You think you can just fucking do something like this and walk away? You're fucked.
314530083         //  When we're done with you I'm gonna feed you to the rats.
314530084         //  You miss your old man, Vito? Don't worry, you're gonna see him soon.
314530090         //  We could still work this out, Vito!
314530100         //  Like father, like son, huh, Vito?
314530101         //  You know what's gonna happen to you when people find out about this?!
314530110         //  You're gonna end up just like your old man!
314530120         //  I never trusted you... from the moment I saw you!
314530121         //  Fat fuck... I never liked you anyway.
314530130         //  I'd spent my whole life trying not to make the same mistakes my old man did, then I find out I'm following in his footsteps.
314530131         //  It was good to finally know the truth though, and Derek's death also helped me resolve another problem...
314530140         //  Hey, Vito. We can take things from here.
314530150         //  What about the cops?
314530160         //  Yeah, they might be a problem, but anyone who saw it'll swear we did it in self defense. You were never here.
314530170         //  Alright, good luck then.
314530180         //  Jesus, Mary and Joseph. God help you all.
314530181         //  This is no good.
314530182         //  This is no damn good. What a fuckup.
314530190         //  Whoa. Looks like I just found Derek's retirement funds.
314530200         //  Now I just gotta grab Joe and we can head to Bruno's...
314990001         //  I didn't sleep at all that night - kept seeing Henry lying there in the park and wishing we'd never heard of the fucking Tongs. Things were bad, and unless me and Joe paid Bruno back right away, they were only gonna get worse.  (Joe on phone)
315050100         //  Shit! What the hell?!
315050120         //  Get him!
315052250         //  Finish the prick off.
315052251         //  Finish him, Vito.
315052252         //  Come on, Vito. Finish him.
315052253         //  Come on, Vito. Do it already.
315052254         //  Hey. We can't hang around here all day.
315069900         //  Goddammit! Somebody kill these two psychos!
315069901         //  You dumb bastard, you don't stand a chance. You can't kill 'em all...
315069902         //  You really are insane aren't you? I'm going to enjoy watching you die.
315069903         //  Come on already. There's only two of 'em.
315069904         //  Ha, ha, ha. Oh, I kinda miss this. Reminds me of my Prohibition days.
315069905         //  Stop destroying the place and die already!
315070001         //  You really think Carlo's right? About Henry?
315070002         //  Yeah, why don't you ask him, tough guy? I'm sure that'd go over real good.
315070003         //  Yeah, but Henry was a good guy. I can't believe the guy was a rat.
315070004         //  Yeah, well, that's the way it goes sometimes... Look, now we gotta deal with this other thing.
315070005         //  Yeah... Don't this seem kinda harsh to you?
315070006         //  Hey, what do you mean 'harsh'? What are we fucking insurance salesmen over here?
315070007         //  It's just that, you know, he's a good guy... Maybe he didn't know about Henry and the Feds...
315070008         //  Whether he did or he didn't - it don't matter. He brought Henry in and the guy turned out to be a rat. You vouch for a rat, you're gonna get it. That's just the way it goes.
315070009         //  Guess I thought Carlo'd make some kinda... exception. I don't know...
315070010         //  Where the hell's Joe?
315070011         //  Hey, no exceptions for nobody. This is the only way everybody stays in line.
315070012         //  So what are we gonna do when he gets here?
315070013         //  We do what Carlo said to do. You wanna argue with him, you be my guest.
315070020         //  Ah, he's probably sleeping.
315070100         //  I sure as hell hope you know what you're doing here.
315070110         //  Don't worry, I took care of it.  You'll see.
315070120         //  So uh, what was he talking about back there?
315070130         //  Nothing, he made me an offer. That's all.
315070140         //  Yeah, I figured out that much. What kind of offer?
315070150         //  He wanted me to whack you. Said he'd make me a capo, give me my own crew. You know, pretty much everything I ever wanted.
315070160         //  Yeah? So why the hell didn't you do it?
315070170         //  Remember that five bucks you owe me?
315070171         //  Soon as I figure that out... You'll be the first to know.
315990001         //  This isn't the way this is supposed to end. Half the gangsters in the city want me and Joe dead, and this time I don't see a way out.
316100010         //  It wasn't always like this.
316100020         //  I used to be a real nice guy. Got a problem? You call Jimmy. In a jam? You call Jimmy. And look what that got me: fifteen years of rubbing elbows with the kind of guys who don't have a problem sucking each other off for a pack of smokes.
316100030         //  Let's just say I was a "cleaner." I cleaned shit up for wiseguys who weren't smart enough to wipe their own asses.
316100040         //  The greaseballs screwed me over first chance they got. Pshhh... Should have seen it coming.
316100050         //  On the bright side, it gave me plenty of time to figure out how I was gonna... repay the favor. Yep, today's gonna be a real good day.
316500010         //  Bet you're wondering how I ended up here. Been thinking about that myself. The best way to say it is, I got comfortable.
316500020         //  See before I got pinched, I had a nice routine going. I got up...
316500030         //  Had my breakfast...
316500040         //  ...and went to work.
316500050         //  I was making some nice cash, and there was never a dull moment. I handled things like inventory management...
316500060         //  Balancing the books...
316500070         //  Labor negotiations...
316500080         //  And uh, "janitorial services." Hey somebody's gotta do it.
316500090         //  That particular day, for everybody else, it was Thursday.
316500091         //  For me, ah, it's the day I got fucked.
316600010         //  They get the message?
316600020         //  Loud and clear.
316600030         //  Good. Now, don't go disappearing on me, Jimmy. I got another job for you soon.
316700010         //  Get out of the car! Put your hands in the air!
316700020         //  Last chance! Get out of the car, NOW!
316700030         //  That's what I got for getting comfortable. I was so busy tying up loose ends for my "employers," I didn't realize the only one left was me.
316700031         //  Assholes set me up good. The dope in the trunk got me fifteen years.
316700032         //  Guess they couldn't find anybody with the balls to try and do me in. Dumb bastards. They got no idea what's coming.
321010010         //  What the hell?!
321010020         //  No, no FUCK!
321010021         //  Everything alright baby?
321010030         //  This is Freddy's.
321010040         //  It's Joe. Henry there?
321010050         //  Hey, Joe.  Na, Henry ain't here.  But Luca's lookin' for ya.  Hold on a sec.
321010060         //  Shhhhit...
321010070         //  Barbaro! Where the hell are you?
321010080         //  I'm home.  Listen Vito just got pinched.  That's why I-
321010090         //  Already?! SHIT!  Alright, shut your mouth and listen.  You remember that thing Vito did with the gas stamps, right?  We just heard that somebody decided to squeal.
321010091         //  Who was it!?
321010092         //  Some guy who works in the gas station in your neighborhood.
321010100         //  I'll kill the fuck.
321010110         //  No you won't. You're just gonna send him a message for now, let him know who he's fuckin' with.  He ends up in a wheelchair, fine, but don't kill the guy.  That's heat we don't need.  Got it?
321010120         //  Yeah, I got it.
321010130         //  You better.  Come by the bar when you're done.
321010131         //  FUCK!
321010132         //  God dammit.  Where the fuck are my pants...
321040040         //  We need to talk.
321040041         //  Sound good to you?!
321040042         //  Ah, shhhhit!!!
321040043         //  Get over here, you little fuck!
321070010         //  Let's try this again.
321070015         //  It wasn't me! I swear! It was Stan! Please, please! It wasn't me!
321070030         //  I didn't say nothin' to nobody. You gotta believe me. It was Stan.  He's the one who bought the stamps.  I swear!
321070040         //  Sorry, pal, I heard that one before.
321070050         //  I ain't lying!  It was Stan who told the cops, not me, I swear!  Please.  Please.
321070060         //  Alright.  Let's pretend I believe ya.  Where's Stan right now?
321070070         //  His shift just ended.  He's headin' straight to the train station...  Catchin' the 5 o'clock to Birkland.  Ain't comin' back till he has to testify.
321070080         //  You know what's gonna happen if you're lyin' to me.
321070090         //  n_Ugh... ugh... ugh...
321070100         //  n_ARGH! Urgh... ohh...
321070105         //  That's for makin' me chase ya.
321100010         //  Hey, Stan!  Where ya goin'?
321100020         //  Oh, shiiit!
321130010         //  n_ pained breathing
321130020         //  Now I want ya to listen real careful, Stan.
321130030         //  You're gonna leave town tonight.
321130040         //  And you ain't gonna come back.
321130050         //  Fine.  But it ain't gonna make a difference.
321130060         //  What the hell's that supposed to mean?
321130070         //  Nothing.
321130080         //  ARGH!!!  Urgh... mmm...
321130090         //  You got yourself nine good fingers left.  Wanna make it eight?
321130100         //  There's somebody else.  Somebody who knows about a lot more than just the OPA robbery.  DA said he's gonna take down everybody.
321130101         //  The DA's gunnin for you. He's gonna take down your whole operation.
321130110         //  Who is this guy?
321130120         //  No idea...
321130140         //  I don't know!  I heard the cops... the cops are keepin' him safe somewhere.  Guess I wasn't important enough for that.
321130150         //  You're not.  Remember that. Now get your ass up.  You got a train to catch.
321150020         //  This is Freddy's.
321150030         //  Hey, it's Joe.  Lemme talk to Luca.
321150040         //  Sure hold on he's right here.
321150041         //  It's Barbaro.
321150050         //  Joe. It done yet?
321150060         //  Yeah but there's somebody else.
321150070         //  What do you mean.
321150080         //  The greasemonkey said the DA's got somebody else.  Somebody who's gonna  take out the whole operation..
321150081         //  Fuckin' Mazzeo...  I knew it.
321150082         //  Who the hell's that?
321150083         //  Richie Mazzeo. They picked him up last month. Guy's a retard but he could put us all away.  FUCK! Alright listen, you're gonna find out where they're keepin' him.  I don't care how. When you do, you make sure he don't talk to nobody ever again. Got it?
321150084         //  Yeah, I got it.  So, did you, uh, hear from Vito?
321150085         //  Just worry about Mazzeo. We'll take care of Vito.
321190010         //  Ssssshit!
321190011         //  Here. Brought ya some coffee.
321190020         //  Thanks. I'm freezin' my balls off out here.
321190030         //  Told ya to dress warm, didn't I?
321190040         //  Hey, I'm wearing the same damn thing as you. It's just that I'm standin' out here while the canary in there's all nice and warm.
321190050         //  God bless the criminal justice system, eh.
321190060         //  Bingo.
321220010         //  Shit!
321220020         //  Hey, what the fuck are you guys...
321220030         //  Ah, shit!
321220040         //  Where the fuck are you guys?!
321230010         //  What the hell are you waitin' for! Shoot this asshole!
321230011         //  You're supposed to be protectin' me, for fuck's sake!
321290010         //  Hey, you wanna argue with the boss, Henry? Huh? I didn't think so. Just worry about that leg of yours. Alright, I'll see ya.
321290020         //  Well?
321290030         //  It's done.
321290040         //  Alright. Good job.
321290050         //  So uh, what's happening with Vito?
321290060         //  We got him the best lawyer in town. He'll be out in no time.
321290070         //  ...for your crimes against the people of this city and of this great country ...
321290090         //  ...this court hereby sentences you to ten years in a federal penitentiary.
321290100         //  What the hell? You said he was gonna get off!
321290101         //  First of all, lower your fuckin' voice. Second, we'll talk about it tomorrow, not now. Go home and cool off, then come back in the morning. Understand?
321290102         //  Yeah, whatever...
321290103         //  Dumb son of a bitch...
321290104         //  FUCK!
321290210         //  Ugh...  Who the hell is this now...
321290220         //  Yeah.
321290230         //  Joe, listen to me-
321290240         //  Henry!  You hear what happened to Vito?  That little cocksucker said he was gonna take care of everything, and then he goes-
321290250         //  Joe...
321290260         //  Joe!
321290270         //  Will you shut your mouth and listen to me!!!
321290280         //  Look, I'm sorry about Vito, there was nothin' I could do, but you gotta  listen. You just made Luca's hit list.
321290290         //  What's that supposed to mean?
321290300         //  It means THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU. That's how it happens, Joe. You must've pissed him off good. You probably got about 5 minutes before the guys show up.
321290310         //  Yeah?  Let 'em come. What the hell do I care.
321290320         //  What are you gonna do, tough guy? Kill 'em?  And then what do you think's gonna happen tomorrow? Look, you got two choices - you can either skip town, or you can stay and die.
321290330         //  And hey, Joe, what you did for me at the distillery... we're even now.
321290333         //  n_ Five years later
321290340         //  You got some balls comin' back here.
321290360         //  Ey!!!
321290370         //  Oh!!!!
321290380         //  Look at this guy! Jeez you ain't changed a bit!
321290390         //  What the hell are you wearin' though?
321290400         //  What, you mean my disguise? Not bad huh?
321290410         //  Yeah, it's about as subtle as a kick in the nuts.
321290420         //  Alright, alright, so how's my place?
321290430         //  Like I told ya on the phone - it's just like ya left it. Here's the keys.
321290440         //  Nice. And uh, how 'bout that job we talked about.
321290450         //  Don't worry, I got more than enough work for both of us these days.
321290460         //  You want a lift?
321290470         //  Na, thanks. Think I'll grab my own.
321810010         //  I heard ya last night with that floozy.  I oughta call the cops.
321810020         //  You're just jealous.
321810030         //  Ugh... In your dreams pal.
321810031         //  More like my nightmares!
321810032         //  What the hell's the matter with people?
321810033         //  Crazy old broads... little gas station pricks... just mind your own fuckin' business.
321810040         //  If Vito goes down for this asshole...
321810041         //  Hey tons-o-fun, where ya goin'?!
321810042         //  Yeah, you forgot to pay the toll. That'll be five bucks.
321810043         //  Wrong guy, wrong day.
321810044         //  Ah, shit... Sorry, Mikey...
321810045         //  Hope that was worth five bucks.
321810050         //  There you are, you little prick.
321810060         //  Hey!
321810130         //  Gonna kill this little prick...
321810131         //  Can't just take his beatin' like a man...
321810180         //  What the fuck am I doin'?  I gotta get to the train station.
321810190         //  This Stan prick's gonna get away!
321810200         //  Let's go!  I got a train to catch.
321820140         //  C'mere, Stan!  I just wanna talk!
321820150         //  You're starting to piss me off!
321820170         //  Guy's a fuckin' circus freak.
321820180         //  All... this fuckin'... runnin'.
321820181         //  Gonna... kill... this prick.
321820182         //  Gotcha.
321820183         //  Argh!
321820184         //  You got a big fuckin' mouth, you know that?
