75508F61         //  Well, are you gonna do somethin'?
7D5F5E1D         //  Well, at least we knew how to have some fun back then.
2473715D         //  Well, believe this. I am the army and I am the government.
9B0BC756         //  Well, best of luck to both of you, but
EC14DF5B         //  Well, better or worse, certainly different.

6A84517F         //  Well, he ain't been friends for a long time...
177871AD         //  Well, he should be in a museum.
405A752E         //  Well, he should've taken you then.
72C088D8         //  Well, he sure speaks English funny.
ABDBE9B9         //  Well, he's doing what he can with what he's been given, I suppose.
F68C7D18         //  Well, he's like a kid growing up without a father.
3339A997         //  Well, here we are,  Armadillo. The biggest town in all of New Austin.
B809FB72         //  Well, here we are.  Thank god.  That was a close shave. Whew!

62D8E1A9         //  Well, if he's alive, I'll try to make sure he stays that way.
8D0241B6         //  Well, if you don't, someone else will. 
86192E0E         //  Well, if you're fixin' for some female company, you can do a lot worse than Armadillo.
6765ED8E         //  Well, if you're interested, I should be at Solomon's Folly in a few days, 
2624BBBB         //  Well, is he wrong? I saw those men from the train.

962F2380         //  Well, look at this!  Some elixir!
618FB348         //  Well, maybe but... 
58460CEA         //  Well, me neither.  But those are my spiritual homes.
2B0E2F9A         //  Well, my boy, it is funny you should say that.
92C07822         //  Well, my family's health and well being

9E33FA5C         //  Well, old man, looks like things is about to get settled once and for all. 
99DFF0EA         //  Well, partner, I think we can safely say this poker game is over. 
E84D94E9         //  Well, sir, I need your help. Ya see, I live in a trading post and well, my wagon's missing .
DCBE33D8         //  Well, some trees flourish, others die.
4AE4E561         //  Well, somebody sure doesn't think of you too kindly.
1CFF4185         //  Well, something like that. I'm headed south. I'm headed down to Mexico.
8773CBD5         //  Well, sure didn't do them much good
582F4016         //  Well, take care then.

EF870872         //  Well, that's an entirely unromantic way of looking at things, I must say.  
14D9B719         //  Well, that's enough fun for one night. Let's head back.
AE8C719F         //  Well, that's good. 
1228FF7C         //  Well, that's it, we're done here.  Here's a little somethin', a token of my appreciation.
7B7E1FFA         //  Well, that's most of the main ranch. It's not chasing notorious outlaws single-handed, but it's my world.
EC55360C         //  Well, that's most of the main ranch. What do you think?
4761858A         //  Well, that's one way to win a horse race!

5718A6CA         //  Well, the rustlers haven't been back, that's for sure.  Your husband can be
BF83FF88         //  Well, then I fear Mexico may not be for you, sir. 
C6B43A05         //  Well, then you're going to have to help her and her family out. 
655EC556         //  Well, there goes your last hope of catching Bill Williamson!

4ABF43AA         //  Well, they bloody better.
5959E339         //  Well, they let in too many foreigners. Just shut the god damn border, or things like this happen.
F010768A         //  Well, they look a bit worse for wear but nothin' a good meal and a strong drink won't cure.  Thank you, John.  We couldn't have done it without you.
DB2A4527         //  Well, things are different now, John.

5478653C         //  Well, we might as well strike while the iron's hot. I think I'm getting the hang of it.
6F9EF328         //  Well, we really do need more horses now!
910018C0         //  Well, we've been together fifty years now, me and my darling, Annabel.
77CD8865         //  Well, welcome to Armadillo, Mr. Marston.

7307F6FB         //  Well, you ain't no kinda man.
3FCC25DF         //  Well, you always wanted to be a rancher.  I'd have thought she'd be just your thing.

0C828765         //  Well, you never tried to save me before. 
960CD8A0         //  Well, you thought wrong.  We don't make deals with the Law.
