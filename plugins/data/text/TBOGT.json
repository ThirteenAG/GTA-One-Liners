I know some people who'd kill to have a fireman turn his hose on them, but these paps aren't so happy. Several of them are getting together to launch a class action suit against the LCFD. Keeping the paps' cameras working is a hell of a lot more important that the firemen's pension plans so I say go for it. Who ever saw an old fireman anyway?"

Our sources hear that an explicit video featuring him and British debutante Daisy Cash-Cooze was broadcast to passers-by before being leaked on the internet. It was like briefly time travelling back to the nineties when people actually went to see Chris Hunt movies. They're about as old as the dinosaurs, people. That oh so familiar sense of disappointment came back too, when we realised that the only thing you get to see is a hand job! Boo! I watch hand shandies every morning in my shower! Come on Chris, you're going to have to do better than that if you expect any of us to believe that you stand to attention for anyone other than your little Filipino house boy! P-lease!"

He's got some really interesting theories he wants to share with luminaries from around the world and thought addressing the Citadel was the perfect way to do it.\" When his agent couldn't secure the appointment (normally reserved for world leaders) he threw a hissy fit and tore up their contract. Hopefully his next agent will be able to help him get that Peace Prize he's been eying for the awards cabinet."

Although some in the DA's office argued that this was a ruse to avoid a court case, Mr. Gravelli never left hospital after being admitted. Mr. Gravelli has been head of the Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never substantiated. What happens now to the delicate balance of power amongst criminal gangs within Liberty City is unknown. It is unlikely to be pretty."

Mr. Blue, along with his brother Bill has become a global superstar thanks to a string of hits and clean cut nature, but it turns out there is more to him than meets the eye. Several Weazel News commentators have encouraged parents to destroy any CDs from the band. Family groups point to the moral degeneracy of our nation's entertainers and said they hope for the day when TV is in black and white again and you don't see the singer's hips. Until then, we feel parents should think twice before letting their children be influenced by this pair of perverts."

This just goes to show that a deviant lifestyle will lead to an unfashionably early arrival at the sodomites' party in Hell."

The mainstream media is to blame, which we are not by any means the mainstream media, despite the fact that we have a TV station in every city with at least one stoplight and are on every cable box in America. We're outsiders, we're angry, and these lazy twenty-somethings want to live on the dole of mommy or America and we're not having it. We prefer to be on the dole of corporate tax breaks and subsidies.
