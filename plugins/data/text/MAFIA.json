		[

		],
		[
			"19990145",
			"We head to an abandoned joint right in Hoboken, it has Palermo Club written on the wall."
		],
		[
			"19990146",

		],
		[

		],
		[
			"19990151",
			"Great."
		],
		[
			"19990161",
			"Then there's still a little problem with guns. I have my own stuff , but you don't,"
		],
		[
			"19990162",
			"You'll need to get some kind of heater.  I think I know a place where you can pick one up."
		],

			"19990171",
			"Where's that?"
		],
		[
			"19990181",
			"It's pretty far, it's probably best to go by train."
		],
		[
			"19990182",
			"Get on here and then go to Hoboken."
		],
		[
			"19990183",
			"Get off at the CENTRAL HOBOKEN station and go in the direction from which you came by the train to the nearest crossroads."
		],
		[
			"19990184",
			"Under the elevated railway there's a road. Follow that and turn left at the next road."
		],
		[
			"19990185",
			"You'll see an old movie house called the Twister."
		],
		[
			"19990186",

		],
		[
			"19990187",
			"Tell him I sent you, and he should have something."
		],
		[
			"19990191",
			"I'll do that now.  I'll get some weapons, then the car,"
		],
		[
			"19990192",
			"then I'll stop by your place."
		],
		[
			"19990201",
			"Yeah pull in front of the building and honk your horn,"
		],
		[
			"19990202",

		],
		[

		],
		[
			"19990301",

		],
		[

		],
		[

		],
		[
			"19991373",

		],
		[
			"19991375",

		],
		[
