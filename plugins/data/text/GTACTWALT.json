I love Kenny, but let's be quite frank, he's finished as a serious contender in this town. The race to replace Hsin, and become the new Triad boss, is between me and Zhou Ming now - and I'm Hsin's son - so it shouldn't take a genius to figure out who'll win! I'm wise, intelligent and the kind of man who sensibly confides in strangers, so I will make an excellent boss as I'm sure my father realizes. It's lucky for you, I like your moves. Maybe there's a future for you with me. I'll be at my garage in East Island City. Come and see me.  Your future friend and boss, Chan Jaoming."

We can hang out and have fun and play beach volleyball together and make a montage video and set it to music and stuff, just like in the movies.

Xin.Huang Lee, I was saddened to see your Uncle Kenny had backed out of the race to succeed Hsin. Now only Chan Jaoming and I contest the leadership. To truly rekindle your family's fortunes you should be working for me, not that fool Chan.  Meet me at my nightclub in East Island City. Bring 20 bags of weed as a down payment on your future - you'll get good prices from Jamaican dealers in Schottler.  Zhou Ming."

Fear not - I'm very capable. I feigned ignorance and cut him into the profits. (Naturally, this only impacted your slice of the take, as it was my idea and ideas don't grow on trees).  You can thank me later.  Zhou Ming."
		],
		[

We must do something about this - his idiocy not his hair - I cannot perform miracles, yet. I tried walking on water the other day - one day...  See you soon. Zhou Ming."

It would be safer for all of us had he been properly organized and not wrecked on drugs, he wouldn't have been arrested in the first place.  If he's made boss, we're all screwed. Huang, don't be a fuck up. I know I can be a bit full on, but I understand this town.  Visit me soon. Zhou."

So, sorry, but that's just the way things are. Anyway, assuming you're not sulking like a spoilt rich kid who doesn't understand that the world doesn't owe him a living, I've got some work for you.
